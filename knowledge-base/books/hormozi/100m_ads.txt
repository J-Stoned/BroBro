When was the last time you took a day off…
...and new clients came into your business?
Last week? Last month? Never?
At this point...I'm sure you've seen what's possible when you have laser-like
focus, an incredible “productized service”, and systems that allow you to
automate high ticket acquisition.
It's a plan that will scale your business to all-time highs.
Your business has the potential to be completely transformed from in the
flesh wizard work, to a fully automated, scalable machine that obliterates the
“service work revenue glass ceiling”, while delighting your clients with
amazing results consistently, without having to deliver on 1-1 coaching
sessions, or painful service delivery complexity.
But now.. I’ve got a question for you:
Do you want to be overwhelmed...running on the one-off marketing
promotion hamster wheel, and delivering value in the flesh?
Or…
Do you want to be free, automate client acquisition, and deliver value via
machines?
If you want to evolve from human to machine, and scale your business
rapidly to brand new heights, then we should talk.
What I’ve done is opened up some availability over the next 4 days for
someone on my team to be able to speak with you personally about your
business, to see if we can help.
www.clientgenerators.com

--- PAGE 3 ---
How it works is we’ll hop on a call with you for 45 minutes, and discuss
whether our approach to scaling will work for your business.
On the call, we'll discuss your business in forensic detail, and brainstorm some
ideas for how you can utilize and transplant our proven systems into your
business, so you can scale at a rapid pace.
The truth is that we are only able to offer a limited amount of free calls each
week, and as of this post there’s just a few spots available.
I encourage you to apply for yours now because this might just be the most
valuable 45 minutes you've ever spent working on your business.
We’ve helped 903 customers and counting make the transformation from
human to machine, so they can unlock the holy heavens of scale and finally
achieve real entrepreneurial freedom.
Now it’s your turn.

Imagine if:
One copied a 1-page website.
Turned on an ad.
and leads rolled in.
Then,
What if:
Those leads were sent to a local business,
in their specific niche of course,
and that business,
paid say…
50 bucks per lead.
And every month,
Month in,
Month out,
That business wrote a check,
Sent in PayPal,
Wire,
www.clientgenerators.com

--- PAGE 5 ---
or Venmo,
5K a month,
for 100 leads,
right back to that lead generator.
The Kicker:
What if there was already,
Over 50 pre-built,
Proven,
Ready to rock n roll,
1-page websites,
in 50 different niches.
Just copy, paste, and go.
Then say,
to get more local business clients,
At 5K or more per month,
Let’s say,
One uses free traffic sources,
Email, DM, whatever it takes,
To get the first couple clients.
And once capital is established...
www.clientgenerators.com

--- PAGE 6 ---
What if:
One copied another website,
But this one is 4 pages,
Turned on an ad,
And booked calls,
With potential clients.
So, every day,
One just wakes up,
Grabs a cup of joe,
And calls people,
On their calendar,
That wants to pay for their service.
After all this,
What if:
One did this,
for 12 months,
Month in,
Month out,
And racked up,
10 clients,
www.clientgenerators.com

--- PAGE 7 ---
at 5K a piece,
Totaling,
50K a month,
in residuals.
Living free,
Having fun,
And giving the middle finger,
To all the haters.

Picture this:
You make a website.
It ranks in Google.
Gets leads.
Those leads get sent to a local business owner.
Who pays you.
Maybe it’s $5 a call.
Or 10% of new sales.
Or a flat $800 a month.
Either way?
Every 30 days, you get a check.
Or a PayPal payment.
Or whatever.
Right?
And this website?
It’s tiny.
A few pages is all.
www.clientgenerators.com

--- PAGE 9 ---
You made it in like an hour.
With no prior experience.
We’re talking:
Drag-and-drop.
Ugly AF.
But who cares?
It’s doing its job.
Now go make another one.
Any city.
Any country.
Any type of business.
Find an easy win.
Something that’ll get lots of leads… with little effort.
Get it up.
(Not like that, Sicko.)
Meaning… live.
Capturing leads.
Then hit up someone in that niche.
Via PM, email, text, call - whatever’s comfy.
www.clientgenerators.com

--- PAGE 10 ---
And offer ‘em a free sample.
Like that nice old lady at Costco.
This way?
There’s no pressure to sell.
Simply… serve.
Let the product speak for itself.
If they want more?
They’ll buy.
If not?
Onto the next one.
Someone’s gonna say yes… eventually.
And when they do?
Boom.
Another money-maker.
Paying you… passively… month after month.
No ad spend.
No selling.
No need to leave the crib.
Do it all from your laptop.
In your spare time.
www.clientgenerators.com

--- PAGE 11 ---
Repeat as often as you’d like.
I’m serious.
Thousands are already doing this successfully.
Why not you?
Matter fact…
Tell ya what:
I’ll show you how to do it… for free.
Just enter your email here:

Then check your inbox.
You’ll get a link to videos, examples, interviews, and more.
Yes, there’s a catch.
Apply for our mastermind… if you want.
It comes with our custom call software.

Get a local number in almost any city.
Track every email and call.
Forward them... hands-free.

Online Trainers
Would you like to know how I grew a 7-figure online fitness business that
sustains itself on auto-pilot?
I know that you’re used to seeing these ads a lot and I apologize for that. You
probably even have the urge to leave a negative comment or leave some
colorful words below.
And that’s ok, I get it. Everybody talks a big game these days.
But this story is real and these “2 comma club” plaques I’m holding here
below are shown to PROVE it. That I’ve done 7 figures in online high ticket
fitness before I ever tried teaching a single trainer what they should or
shouldn’t do.
Now…
If you got into the fitness industry because you have a passion for it, you're
willing to do the work, and you just want to help more people.
But you just have no idea who is telling the truth or where you should even
start, then I want you to keep reading.
My name is Tanner Chidester and just a few years ago I was living at my
parents’ house with a 16-year-old mazda protégé in my possession and
$2000 to my name at the age of 23. Talk about “living the dream” lol.
I was a former division 1 football athlete and used to being “Big Man On
Campus” and so the embarrassment and self-esteem issues at the time were
at an all-time high.
I had just left petroleum engineering school to “pursue my business dream”
and my girlfriend at the time told me “I wouldn’t ever make it and I was dumb
for doing this.”
www.clientgenerators.com

--- PAGE 14 ---
My own family was talking behind my back and always would slide in
comments about “how is the business going?” You get the picture, nobody
thought I was going to be successful.
So, my online training journey began…
I started working every day for hours on end on my “low ticket” $47 offers. I
thought I was going to be the next “big thing” in the online space.
I was also working as a server, door to door salesman, and doing any odd
jobs I could find to get by.
And over the next two years I made a grand total of $2000 in my business. I
almost quit like five times and now at the age of 25 I was starting to think
everybody else was right.
If it weren’t for a dear friend and mentor that just told me to keep going I
wouldn’t be where I am today.
So, as a final attempt to be successful I hired a business coach. I remember to
this day my heart was pounding. “It’s $5000 to join.”
I almost cried. I didn’t have that money. I only made $2000 a month and after
rent I had maybe a $500 left. But I knew this was my final hope, so I took the
plunge. I applied for a credit card and prayed to god that this “thing” would
work.
And it did…kinda.
You see over these last two years I had failed a lot, but I had built MASSIVE
skills in sales and communication. Door to door sales and being a server will
have that effect on you. So, when I got into this program I was primed for
growth.
But here’s what irritated me.
Although I started making a lot of money (30-50k months) the entire strategy
was cold outreach.
www.clientgenerators.com

--- PAGE 15 ---
Message, Message, and Message some more. Now I’m one of the hardest
workers on the planet, I truly believe that. I was spending 12-16 hours a day
messaging as fast as I could and as many people as I could to get this thing
off the ground.
And it worked, but how sustainable does that sound to you?
Even if you could message people all day long and make money how long
can you keep that up before you’d burn out?
I knew I had a short amount of time to figure out a better way before I’d be
right back in the same situation I started in.
So, what did I do? I hired even MORE coaches.
But the next few experiences didn’t go so well, in fact I lost a lot of money. And
after 5 more coaches and another $50,000 (to date I’ve now spent over 115k) I
was ready to quit again. I was burnt out from messaging and I just figured a
9-5 had to be less stress.
But then something happened…
I tested one final method (that I use to this day) and it worked.
Like really worked...WITHOUT any cold outreach or hours of mindless
messaging hoping to get a reply.
And I grew…FAST. So, fast that I got to 7 figures in just 12 months and I’ve never
looked back. And heck I even have a life now outside of work :)
But most trainers I knew were still struggling with the same old cold outreach
method. So, what did I do?
I started a second business. This time helping other trainers to REPLICATE the
type of success I’ve had (I still have my other fitness business running
simultaneously. Most coaches can’t say that) because let’s be honest.
If you can even do 5% of what I did/do in a month now you’ll be living a VERY
good life. You don’t have to be “as good as me,” just a fraction.
www.clientgenerators.com

--- PAGE 16 ---
And as of now I truly believe I am the most qualified person out there to be
teaching this. Sure, I’m biased and sure lots of coaches have good intentions,
but when you can’t even get your bills paid that doesn’t matter much.
I’m not even going to hard sell you on this because I’m blessed to work with
hundreds and hundreds of clients at this point, but if this has resonated with
you and you just “get it” I want to invite you to do 3 things.
1. Click the link to view the short training
2. Apply to speak with me or my team if you like what you see.
3. We’ll hop on a call and figure out the perfect strategy for you together.
All I ask in return is that you are an action taker, you really want to get people
results, and you’re willing to do the work.
Speak soon.

I felt stuck…
I wasn't fulfilled in my Accounting job, but I didn't know what else to do.
My alarm clock would go off, I'd open my eyes and I'd realize it's a weekday...
that meant it was a workday.
I'd sigh, get out of bed, and mindlessly go through the motions of moving my
body to my cubicle.
I was so used to this that I basically "zoned out" most of the week just so I
could get through it.
I knew I wanted more. I'd taken the actions that society had convinced me I
needed to in order to achieve success (I went to college and got a good job in
accounting), but I found out very quickly that I was not fulfilled at all by any of
that.
I questioned if my dreams were possible, or even real.
I hated working at the accounting firm, but I didn't have much choice at the
time.
I was SO frustrated, overwhelmed and confused.
I lived for the weekends and spent my days wishing time would pass quicker.
Now that I know what I know now, I can't believe I wished so much of my life
away.
So I searched relentlessly for alternatives…
I had so much motivation and read every book I could on becoming
successful, but was still so lost and confused about what to do with this
motivation.
www.clientgenerators.com

--- PAGE 18 ---
UNTIL ONE DAY I FIGURED IT OUT.
I learned how to create a full time online income with different businesses.
I also learned that I could teach people how to do the same.
I went to work applying these new methods and saw incredible results.
Over the next 18 months, I went on to quit my job and made over $10,000,000
selling digital courses and helping students from all over the world quit their
jobs and achieve financial freedom.
People started noticing my results and talking about my story and before long
I had people asking me to teach them how to start their own digital course
businesses and create a passive income source.
They were so intrigued with what I was doing, and were well aware of the
benefits of creating a digital course.
Soon students started seeing results, some even better than my own which
showed me that we had a successful and replicable strategy.
By popular demand, I decided to open my digital course strategy to the
public and to teach everyone the power of digital courses.
I called it Digital Course Secrets - and I put together a FREE Training to show
you how...
I created DCS to teach you how to break free from the unfulfilling cycle that I
experienced and millions settle for daily.
It makes me so proud to say that we've been able to show so many students
a way out.
We've done this through teaching them how to choose a niche for their
course, how to become an expert in their field even without loads of
experience and how to find a passionate group of students that will beg to
buy their course.
www.clientgenerators.com

--- PAGE 19 ---
Our students who have implemented our teachings have completely
transformed their lives.
Want to know what we shared with these students ?
I spent the past few months putting together a free training for you showing
you *exactly* how I got started and grew my digital course business into the
millions. I literally pull back the curtain and reveal it all including the the key
lessons that have been the foundation of my success and my student's
success.

Can I be honest with you about these online gurus?
There are only a small handful of them that are bringing in these types of
numbers...
Which means that 99.9% of the people you see ads from, are amateurs at
best…
I don’t mean to sound negative, but you don’t need to be teaching people
how to build a 7 figure business if you don’t have a 7 figure business...
Well I do... and have for years... and the numbers in this screenshot are an
everyday occurrence for me...
I'm not saying this to brag, I'm saying it so you actually pay attention to my
advice…
What do I sell?
Online courses. Info products. My advice. Whatever you wanna call it... I sell
education.
How do I do it?
Well I run ads just like this one to a group of people I think would be interested
in my online programs.
I send them to a free class that’s completely automated, and I try to deliver as
much value as I can, while at the same time making sure I weed out people I
don’t want to work with…
Then at the end of the presentation I offer them my product for sale...
The thing is only about 2% of them actually purchase...
www.clientgenerators.com

--- PAGE 21 ---
Which is totally fine, because that percentage has grown me a highly
profitable and lucrative 7 figure course business…
The best part? I don’t do launches OR live webinars…
Everything is completely automated.
I build a machine. I refine the machine. Then I feed the machine with traffic.
If you would like to see a 50 minute break down of exactly how I do this....
Then yes, shockingly, I have a webinar you can register for and watch at no
cost…
It’s called, "How Just One Evergreen Webinar Built Our 7 Figure Online Course
Business"
Register here: (LINK)
Now listen, this is not for everyone.
This is only for true expert‘s that are very good at what they do and have
knowledge that can solve a major problem.
This is not for whiners, crybabies or complainers.
This is not for people to try something once, it doesn’t work, and then they give
up and ask for a refund... then cry "scam" and go sit in a corner and pout...
This is not for people that think it’s as easy as 1-2-3, or it’s just a simple script...
This is for people who want to build something amazing, impact the world,
and don’t mind putting in the work to actually get good at their craft…
If this sounds like you then register for the training.
If it doesn’t sound like you, then please do not opt in to any of my programs or
buy anything from me. I don’t want to do business with you.

Peter Thiel, the cofounder of Paypal would always ask:
"How can I achieve my 10 year plan in the next 6 months?"
My first thought when I heard this..
“How the heck is that even possible?”
Now looking back..
I’m surprised I didn’t start thinking like this sooner..
Here is what I mean..
Hi my name is Mike Vestil and before I built multiple successful 6 and 7 fig biz
ventures, grew my YouTube™ channel to over 204,000 YouTube™ subscribers,
and became an author of a wildly popular book..
I used to lie awake in the middle of the night staring up at the ceiling
wondering how the heck I was going to make my biz idea work..
“How would I find my next client?”
“How can I become successful even though my competitors are better known
than me?”
“Why does it feel like there's an invisible ceiling on my income?”
These are the questions that HAUNTED my mind as I struggled to achieve the
life that I wanted..
It wasn’t until I figured out a concept called “quantum leaping” did I figure out
a way to turn my "10 year plan" into my 6 month goal..
Crazy enough is once I followed these 3 simple steps..
www.clientgenerators.com

--- PAGE 27 ---
My 5 year plan was accomplished in as little as 2 weeks..
Here’s exactly how:
Step 1: I realized that my business was a mirror
One of the biggest things I learned about success was that you cannot chase
it..
You need to “attract it” by the person you become..
Earlier on I was always trying to 10x my income when little did I know that I had
to 10x who I was as a person and the value that I provided in the marketplace
first
Jim Rohn said it the best,
“Don’t wish it was easier, wish you were better”
“Don’t wish for less challenges, wish for more wisdom”
“Don’t with for less problems, wish for more skill”
For me to get the results I wanted.. I LITERALLY HAD TO BECOME A DIFFERENT
PERSON..
And the moment I figured out that my PERSONALITY will dictate my PERSONAL
REALITY was the moment I made my first quantum leap.
How it worked was I wrote down exactly what my 5 year vision of how I
wanted my life to look like in the future..
But more importantly I asked myself,
“WHO DO I NEED TO BECOME.. to deserve the thing that I want out of life?”
Step 2: The power of strategic alliances
Business is a lonely game..
www.clientgenerators.com

--- PAGE 28 ---
What hurts even more was when I had this vision for a greater life, but my
parents and friends though I was crazy and dumb for pursuing things that lit
my soul on fire..
It was a loneliness that crushed my soul and almost made me give up
countless of times..
What helped was finding people that I could align with that would bring me
up instead of push me down..
That’s when I realized that I would become the average of the 5 people that I
would hang around with the most..
I looked around at all of my “close friends”
Many of whom were broke, sad, unmotivated, and afraid to think big..
What made things even worse was many would unconsciously sabotage my
dreams by pulling me down to their level..
What changed was when I sought out “strategic alliances”
People who would pull me up instead of push me down..
People whose goals made my goals look tiny
And people who were “allergic” to being average..
THIS IS THE FASTEST WAY TO GROW AND QUANTUM LEAP.
Find 5 people that have the life you want and get around them ASAP.
Step 3: Find a higher purpose
Zig Ziglar said it the best,
“If you help enough people get what they want, then you can have anything
you want”
www.clientgenerators.com

--- PAGE 29 ---
Instead of focusing on my income goals,
I had to focus on a dream client that I was willing to serve.
And once I built my business based off of the clients needs
-I was able to charge $3k-$10k for my advice
-I was able to build a business that grew exponentially
-I was able to do so without being a slave to my business
This week we are finally revealing to the world how we’ve been doing this for
years..
This is not a live webinar, it is an "On Demand" training...

If this training resonates with you and you feel we can help you scale your
business to the next level..

Information I paid $240k for in this post
In November 2017 I made the biggest purchase of my entire life (to date),
wiring $120k for a 6 month consulting gig with a legendary marketer.
And in October 2018 I did it again.
My name is Taylor Welch and I’m the co-Founder of Traffic And Funnels™… an
agency helping client businesses scale (the RIGHT way).
The marketer we paid to consult with, his name is Jay Abraham. And in the
last 2 years I’ve spent dozens of hours with him and Chris (my business
partner), breaking down everything he’s learned in 50 years of marketing and
over 8 BILLION dollars in sales.
One of the biggest things I learned from Jay is that there are only (at the max)
five different kinds of wealth you can build in a business.
Not 12. Not 16. FIVE.
Obviously, inside these 5 categories are different “tactics,” but categorically,
there are just five different kinds or “types” of business wealth.
I asked Jay if I could share with our crew and he said “Of course as long as
you give me credit.” Haha.
So I’ve put together a training overview — which will break down these
different types of wealth and a few “how to” items regarding what to do to
implement this stuff.
If your goal is long term stability, consistency, longevity, security, control (etc
you get the gist) — you’re gonna want to take 15 minutes and watch this
training and implement what I teach you.

🤮
I'm sick of it.
There's so much skepticism out there.
And it's rightfully so…
Starting an online business has been INFECTED by lies and deceit.
I don't have the houses, the cars, or the women.
All I have is ONE SKILL.
That one skill is teaching other people how to create insanely profitable
business quickly by selling on Amazon FBA.
Amazon has the customers, but it's not that simple…
For the first 6 months of my journey selling on Amazon FBA, I leaned heavily on
my "Amazon Crutch".
This crutch would hold me up no matter what stupid logic I threw at it!
"yeah the product is the exact same as my competitor but it doesn't matter,
Amazon is so big there is enough to go around.."
"I don't have to have the best quality, as long as I'm better than those losers
on page 10!"
And on it went.
I lost $20,000+ investing my life savings in products that were destined to fail
long before I pulled out my wallet.
But all over the internet I saw success.
www.clientgenerators.com

--- PAGE 33 ---
Cars, houses, screenshots beyond belief.
I had to figure it out!
I scoured the internet, looked at all the "secret chat rooms" that weren't
infected by "gurus"
I tested, I threw products away, I held a bonfire in my backyard.
And suddenly one of them went crazy.
10k
20k
30k
50k
per month
But I was still screwed. I didn't know what was different about this one product.
There were so many factors...
I kept digging, I called seller support, I posted the product publically and got
thousands of people's feedback.
And eventually, months later, I mapped out what I thought was the "formula".
It was pretty close.
Next product made me 20k per month.
This is when the breakthrough happened…
Before, I only had bad products to compare to bad products.
Now I had a great one to compare to an average one.
www.clientgenerators.com

--- PAGE 34 ---
The difference was glaring, it blinded me with how obvious it was.
Here's what I learned.
1) Small Budget Economics (The Prize)
Competing on Amazon is more about ducking all the big dogs than it is about
running in there wild and optimistic.
I learned that all my good products were in categories that 7 of the top 10
products had more than 5k in revenue each.
Simply put, they had high demand, duh, but spread out over the whole top 10
which was key.
I also saw that 7 out of the top 10 products in my category had less than 75
reviews.
I almost laughed for 5 days when I figured this out.
I'd been looking at it backwards.
I was looking for a "slot" in the top 10 that had little reviews.
Like that guy has 10 reviews and everyone else has 3,000 I'll just take his spot!
WRONG.
The whole market (top 10) needed to be favorable.
Finally, I realized that my profits were directly related to, well, profits...
hahahahaha seriously.
How dumb is this that it's amazing.
The products that won?
They had 200% ROI
www.clientgenerators.com

--- PAGE 35 ---
That meant I could buy 2 with the 1 that I had sold :)
2) A Stress Free Supply Chain
I sent my first products to my house.
And by house I mean my 400sq ft studio apartment at the time....
By the time I packed the 500 boxes into my 2000 Nissan Maxima and got
them to UPS and paid to get them to Amazon my margins dipped and I
literally almost threw my back out... lol
Not to mention the failed shipment of baby hooded towels that I had to
repackage by hand that took 20 hours.
Now, for products that make us a ton of money, we just send straight from our
supplier to Amazon.
I haven't seen a box in over a year and a half, and I've never been happier (or
making more money)
3) Autopilot Paradise
Advertising. Wow. Nothing brings a business greater joy than being able to
bring customers in the door.
Problem was, I tried to do it all manually at first.
I was up all hours of the night optimizing my PPC campaigns and stressing
out that I was spending $50 to sell a $15 dollar product and literally
Paying.
Amazon.
for the privilege of selling on their platform…
It was a joke, but I wasn't laughing.
www.clientgenerators.com

--- PAGE 36 ---
Finally, I figured out how to optimize these campaigns, to make them run like
a machine.
They got smarter and smarter the longer they ran.
Instead of spending more money to acquire a customer, the spent LESS, yet
acquired MORE.
If that's not backwards happiness inducing magic I don't know what is.
These three things flipped the switch for our company.
They transformed it from barely alive to a $4,000,000 per year profit churning
masterpiece.
They lifted me up out of a studio apartment where I could barely walk to an
apartment in the sky downtown where I drink my morning coffee across from
my wife.
If you don't want to stress about selling on Amazon, you should probably learn
from me and NOT do what I did.
Don't go at it alone, come learn how to do it properly.
Here's a link to a 100% FREE Amazon FBA Training that actually doesn't suck.
I mean that.
It's quite incredible, and I'm hosting.

If it’s new, shiny, sexy… people flock to it:
- Airbnb
- Shopify
- Amazon
- Webinars
- Consulting
- Google ads
- Facebook ads
Not me.
I’m staying put.
Doing what’s always worked.
(And always will.)
Which is:
Forwarding leads to business owners.
Think 1-800-Flowers.
My job is to promote a phone number.
That’s it.
I do it all online, from my laptop, without leaving the crib.
www.clientgenerators.com

--- PAGE 39 ---
And each client pays me a few bucks per call
Give or take.
It’s like affiliate marketing, only better.
Cuz, let’s face it, getting someone to call a chiropractor, for example, when
their back hurts?
Ain’t exactly hard.
And with so many different businesses and so many cities, I can cherry-pick
the easiest deals.
As in, scope out something that’ll get lots of calls with little effort.
And then, boom, go into that niche…
Grab a local phone number (we can get you one for any city, with our custom
call software)…
Strategically spread it around the internet…
(*Without* paying for ads, by the way!)
And, when it starts getting calls?
I’ll contact a biz owner in that city, who provides that service, and offer ‘em a
handful of leads… for free.
He or she accepts.
Gets a new customer or two.
Says:
“Keep ‘em comin’.”
www.clientgenerators.com

--- PAGE 40 ---
To which I say:
“Happy to - for $3 per call.”
(Sometimes more, sometimes less, depending on the project.)
And they say:
“Deal.”
But the beautiful thing is, from there?
My work is pretty much done.
The phone keeps ringing, I keep earning.
And yet, I’m off setting up the next one.
Cool, right?
And it’s proven AF.
Like I said, this is nothing new.
Smart marketers have been doing this for years.
But what’s funny is, with each new fad in the IM space, more and more people
are jumping ship.
And abandoning this tried and true business model.
Like, in the last year, competition’s been going down, not up.
Which is crazy.
Cuz I can’t dream up a better business.
I mean, all you need is a phone number, some focus, and a few minutes of
marketing a day, and you’re getting calls.
www.clientgenerators.com

--- PAGE 41 ---
Don’t get me wrong, though.
No one campaign’s gonna make you rich.
Like, say you royally suck on your first attempt.
And you only average two calls a day.
That’s 60 calls a month.
If your deal was a piddly $3 a call?
That’s only $180 a month, right?
Okay, no sweat.
That’ll pay your cell phone each month.
Now go do another one.
Get a lil’ better.
Charge $4 a call.
Generate more calls.
Knock out a bigger bill.
Keep goin’.
Why stop?
What if you had 10 of these suckers?
20?
50?
Paying you, passively, every single month!?
www.clientgenerators.com

--- PAGE 42 ---
Freedom, that’s what.
And I know you’re rolling your eyes right about now.
Can’t say I blame ya.
If I were you, I’d be thinkin’ two things:
One, sounds too good to be true.
Two, if it were anywhere near that good, you’d keep it to yourself - and you
wouldn’t be here, telling me about it.
Both valid points.
Until you consider:
A, I’ve been doing this for a decade, and can prove it.
And B, I’ve got something for sale.
And there’s plenty of room for the both of us to do it, without stepping on one
another’s Nikes.
Still.
If me monetizing the “how to” gets your knickers knotted?
So be it.
Just keep scrolling.
But you could also think about what’s in it for you.
Right?
Like:
Say I taught you the steps.
www.clientgenerators.com

--- PAGE 43 ---
And showed you real-life examples.
And let you hear from hundreds of people who’ve already bought my paid
program.
Who’re doing this, successfully, themselves.
Would that be worth entering your email on this page here?

Yes, no, maybe so?
Dude.
What’s the worst that could happen?
You watch one video, decide you don’t wanna do it, and unsubscribe from my
emails?
Not the end of the world.
But what if you really get excited about it?
What if everything I said is true?
And you could see yourself kicking some serious butt with this “old school”
internet biz?
Well, in that case, you might consider applying for our mastermind.

Forget Those Guys:
"I made $426,000 in four days," I heard him say through a smug, half-drunk
smile.
The people around him leaned in and frothed at the mouth.
They looked at him and talked to him like he was a god... they took everything
that he said as FACT.
They wanted THAT kind of a result...
So they hung on his every word.
It was kind of gross, to be honest.
I was curious, so I walked up to the center of the room. "Darren," I said. "Could
you explain to me how your business model works?" Darren took a sip of his
Rum and Coke and coughed. "If I told you, I'd have to kill you," he said to
laughter.
I waited while he took another sip.
Then he kind of laughed and said, "OK, the basics are: I meet a bunch of
people at conferences. I invite them to partner with me on launches. And we
throw up a crappy product and sell it until it stops making money." He
laughed.
I didn't.
I said, "so, basically, you do a big 'circle jerk' with your friends who you meet at
conferences, and you screw over your customers?" "BASICALLY YES!" Darren
said to thunderous laughter.
www.clientgenerators.com

--- PAGE 46 ---
One person literally wrote that down, like it was a wise piece of advice.
I looked down at my feet, frustrated.
I was 24 years old and still trying to "find my way" in the world.
I hadn't made my first million yet.
I felt really uncomfortable at this conference.
None of it felt authentic.
I turned my back on the group and said out loud, "Man, forget those guys."
Over the years, I had thought that "those guys" had it figured out.
There was only really ONE THING that I learned from that conference... And it
was this:
Who you know is everything. "Those guys" did so well because they knew other
people. They worked with others who had the same goal (even if their goal
was evil). They had partners and colleagues that they worked with.
That's why I had to build my own "Tribe" of people over the years.
And we build businesses with as much, or more upside than these people
mentioned above. The big difference is that our brands actually bring VALUE
to our customers lives.
Everybody's life is upgraded when they become involved with our brands.
This value that we bring to a specific group of people also makes bigger
brands & investors want to buy our companies.
Sometimes for millions. Sometimes for hundreds of millions.
I've recently outlined our model & strategies for building valuable, sellable
businesses.

Did you know that more millionaires are created from real estate than any
other industry in the world?
And that’s cool and all, but real estate used to be HARD… so how does this
apply to you?
Well, there’s a NEW way to real estate wealth and it’s simpler than ever!
In fact, you can do it from home… even if you have not a lot of money to invest,
no experience and no license.
And I’m doing a free webclass that will show you how so go save your spot
now>> (LINK)
Look, I can’t guarantee your results, because it’s really up to you, but I can tell
you with 100% confidence that it’s possible.
How do I know that?
Because my student Matt Larson is living proof!
He’s consistently doing 1-2 real estate deals a month online using nothing but
his phone and computer…
Now again I’m not saying you’ll do that or that Matt’s results are the average…
but it’s amazing to watch how real estate can change peoples lives…
And it’s changed my life as well! I went from living in a bathroom and in trailer
parks to becoming a millionaire in my 20’s…
And it’s allowed me to live life on my own terms, retire my parents so they
could finally relax and enjoy life, spend time with the people I love, travel
around the world and become the best possible version of myself…
www.clientgenerators.com

--- PAGE 49 ---
And when I started teaching others, many had the same results!
Who’s to say that you can’t be next?!
So if you want to stop dreaming about success and financial freedom and
actually experience what it’s like to live life on your own terms…
You’re going to love this…
Like I said, I’ve arranged a special bonus online webclass training for you,
completely free. (Spots will be granted on a first come first serve basis.)
You can get all the details (and claim your spot) by going to: (LINK)
And in case you’re wondering, you’ll learn how to do 1-2 real estate deals a
month online from your phone or computer WITHOUT:
-Investing your own money or using credit
-Without leaving your home
-And without having to visit properties
Now - I know that’s a big promise, and even though many of my students
have already turned this into their reality, your results are entirely up to you…

can’t, you’re right” ;)

How does a new online course creator do over $20k in sales (with a $197
product) from his first launch?
The answer isn't some magic, complex sales funnel. It's not big affiliate
partners, and it's not with a big email list. In fact, this was one of the simplest
launches I've ever seen.
When my buddy Joseph Michael told me about his launch, I immediately
asked him to show me behind the scenes...
When he opened it up I was really surprised by the simplicity of the whole
thing...
At the heart of it all is a 6-part email sequence. That's it. 6 emails.
It's seriously effective, but simple enough for anyone to model.
And here's the kicker…
Not only did he give me a copy of the entire sequence he used. He also gave
me permission to share it with y'all…
If you want to download a copy, just click here and I'll send it over (for free)
--> (LINK)
Seriously, if you're an online course creator you've gotta check this out.
There's one email that goes out each day for 4 days, then 2 emails on the last
day. 5 days of emails that lead to over $20k in sales
When I was looking at them in more details I noticed two more things:
www.clientgenerators.com

--- PAGE 51 ---
1. 82% of sales came from the Monday emails.
2. Sunday’s email was very good. This is the key email in the sequence (it's
worth downloading the sequence to see this email alone).
Here's the link again if you want to download a free copy of his exact email
sequence --> (LINK)
Most course creators fall into the trap of big expensive launches and
complicated sales funnels. But what if you invest all of that time and money
and it doesn't work?
Instead of all that unnecessary extra fluff, why not grab a copy of this
sequence, model it for your next launch, get some sales, and add complexity
if and when you need to…
Seems like a no-brainer to me.

Deal closed and contract signed.
I can remember like it was yesterday, a lady from Australia wanted me to
teach her how to create her own digital products and run paid traffic.
She booked an appointment to speak with me and in less than 30 minutes of
that phone call, I closed my first consulting client at $20k.
This was nearly a decade ago and honestly I sorta got lucky.
I didn't have a system in place.
I just so happened to have talked to the right person at the right time.
However, this one deal intrigued me.|
I made more in a single day than I did the entire year working at my job.
I couldn't help but to imagine what life would be like if I could get MORE clients
like her, but consistently and predictably.
I went back and evaluated everything that led up to the sale and had a huge
"aha" moment.
I created a system around the process and coupled it with paid traffic to put it
to an official test.
What happened next blew my mind.
I ended up getting so many high ticket clients that first year, I was able to
comfortably leave my job and pursue consulting full-time.
The system worked like a charm and with some slight tweaks for today's
marketplace, it's STILL working!

If you're a coach, consultant, service provider or professional that's looking to
leverage your expertise and get premium consulting clients who value your
worth, I just released a mini course showing you step-by-step EXACTLY how
it's done.

Four years ago I was dead broke living and working out of my parents garage
in New Zealand trying to start my own consulting business.
I cold called, door knocked, attended networking events and none of it worked
for me. I was rejected, humiliated, forced to draw up proposals that nobody
even looked at and ended up depressed with nothing to show for it but a
$60,000 debt.
I didn't understand why the advice that was given to me in all of the books
and all of the websites online didn't work. My girlfriend left me because I
couldn't even afford to take her out to dinner and worked 15 hours a day
stressed out of my mind with a pay grade lower than a 14 year on his first day
at Mcdonalds.
I tried everything to get clients and none of it worked. Then one day I thought
to myself: "Instead of begging people for 5-minutes of their time and going to
them, what if there was a way to make them come to me instead?".
I went back to the drawing board and stayed up days and nights on end
figuring out ways where I could completely flip the model and make clients
come to me instead.
Then one day i figured it out!
I went to work applying this new method for attracting and winning high value
clients and it worked like magic. 1 client, 2 clients, 3 clients and then it caught
fire and I had more clients than I could possibly handle and had to actually
STOP marketing so I could catch up on the work.
Over the next 12 months I made $100,000. The next year - $500,000. The next
$1,200,000. The next - $2,400,000 and now this year (2016) I have already
made $6,000,000 and we're only 6 months in.
www.clientgenerators.com

--- PAGE 55 ---
I moved out of my parents garage in New Zealand and moved to a 28th floor
apartment in Manhattan. I'm from a poor family in a small suburb in New
Zealand... This was BIG money!
People started noticing my results and talking about my story and before long
I had people asking me to teach them how to start their own consulting
businesses and get high paying clients of their own.
At first I said "No" because I honestly didn't believe that anybody else could do
what I was doing. I thought I was unique and that nobody else would be able
to make it work. But this one guy Stanley just wouldn't give up and he was
consistent as hell! He would email me 2-3 times per day telling me he
wanted to learn my methods and that he was even willing to pay me.
After a few months of non-stop messages I gave in and decided to try
teaching my methods to Stanley. I didn't even think it would work for him but
he begged me to do it... We jumped on Skype calls twice per week and I
taught him my process from start to finish.
Within three weeks I couldn't believe it... Stanley got his first $10,000 client. I
almost fell off my chair! Stanley went from knowing NOTHING about business
or consulting and within three weeks he picked up his very first client for
$10,000.
I wondered if this could be replicated again so I accepted five more people
and showed them how to do it and then BAM - they started getting clients
too! Then I started working with more people, the groups grew from 10 to 20 to
30 and I kept teaching them my same methods and they kept getting results.
Fast Forward to this current day and I now have 136 consultants making
6-figure incomes AND 9 consultants making million dollar incomes from my
advice and trainings.
It's honestly hard to believe how this happened so fast. I went from being
depressed and broke working out of my parents garage in New Zealand to
the skyline of Manhattan and over $10,000,000 in 4 years flat. Add to that the
fact that I've created 9 millionaires and 136 6-figure consultants at the same
time.

So what is it about my consulting methods that are so damn good?
How have I created extreme liquid wealth for myself and my clients in such a
short time?
Well it all comes down to relentless focus on 3 Key things…
We live in an ADD world where there is too much information and too many
distractions. While others have tried to do it all - I have tried to do less. In the
modern world it's more about what your ignore rather than what you do.
While others burn themselves out trying to do 52 different things I focus on 3.

I spent the past week putting together a free training for you showing you

Going slow sucks.
Which is why we stopped doing network marketing and affiliate marketing.
It just took too long to make too little.
My wife and I needed an internet business that could scale FAST!
And guess what? We found it.
“So what is it?”
We get leads for small businesses using paid ads.
(That we place on Facebook and Google.)
Those leads get forwarded to the biz owner, who happily pays us four figures
a month to keep ‘em coming.
“Why would they do that?”
Because they don’t know how to do it themselves, nor do they want to, and
the leads make ‘em 5-10 times what they’re paying us.
“Good for you — why should I care?”
Well, if you’re sick of going slow, you might wanna look into building your own
“ad agency.”
All you need is a computer, some common sense, and a lil’ hustle.
We can teach you the rest.
“And why would you do that?”
www.clientgenerators.com

--- PAGE 61 ---
Because we’re already doing it ourselves, every single day — why not
monetize the how-to as well?
“Won’t that make it saturated for you?”
Nah, there’s millions of businesses who need this service. Even if we had a
small army helping us, we couldn’t even put a dent in all that potential.
“But I’ve never done anything like this…”
Neither had we. But it’s quick and easy to learn — if you’re coachable.
“What if I don’t have much time?”
All it takes is a few hours to make an ad campaign that crushes it for one of
these businesses.
After that, it’s pretty much set-and-forget.
Zero begging, babysitting, blogging, or back-linking required.
“Yeah, but I don’t have money for paid ads.”
Who does? We make the business owner pay for the ads and the few tools we
need to run the entire operation… and that’s on top of our monthly fee!
“Okay, but how will I get clients?”
It’s easier than you think.
These business owners don’t care that you’re a no-name with no past clients
or that you’re wearing sweats, lounging on the couch, working on a laptop.
None of that matters when you use the idiot-proof strategy I reveal in this
video:

The “Classic” Ad Agency Blueprint…
✔
Get Kicked-Out of as many FB Groups as possible Advertising Your Offer…
✔
Get Hung Up on Cold Calling Business after Business…
✔
Get 3% open rates on emails that yield ZERO return on investment…
✔
Get Fired by yet another client that isn’t happy with their results…
✔
Buy another course that promises ‘The Dream’ but doesn’t deliver…
✔
Crawl back to your 9-5 job because you’re out of money and are tired of
failure…
This is the ‘Classic Blueprint’ I’ve seen fail again and again…
Over the past few years…
I’ve seen many ‘WANTrepreneurs’ come and go,
And they all had that fire…
That drive…
That “Nothing can Stop Me attitude”...
But when It came down to it…
They failed…
Not because of a lack of motivation, drive, or passion…
But because of resources...
www.clientgenerators.com

--- PAGE 64 ---
The reason they failed was because they didn’t have the right information…
Knowledge is Power…
The more you learn, the more you earn…
Period.
Building wealth is not about grinding and working harder…
It’s about leveraging systems…
Systems that cut out the fat…
Cut out the grind…
The struggle…
The “figuring out”...
Systems that are already figured out…
To the point that all you have to do is…
Simply…
Turn it on…
Sound crazy…?
Good!
It should sound crazy…
If you want normal, then expect normal results…
I like CRAZY results!!!
Wouldn’t you agree?

Think of it like this,
Think of a Franchise.
A Franchise like a McDonalds™...
A McDonalds™ takes $X to start up...
The Burgers, the Fries, the recipes,
The employee uniforms, the Branding, the Marketing,
It’s all already figured out...
You don’t need to figure out what goes on a McChicken...
It’s already done for you.
So, you just need to get it, use it, and profit from it.
Make sense?
That’s exactly what this is.
An already figured out, done for you solution that you simply apply to your
business…
And watch the results pour in…
See here: (LINK)
And what I’ve done…
Is I brought this Franchise concept to Internet Marketing…
Specifically, in the Local Business niche....
For example…

Some will doubt the success of my Social Media Marketing Agency program.
They’ll even call it a scam. The reality is... they’re kind of right.
Let me explain:
In 380 BC, Plato told a story called the Allegory of the Cave. In his story, Plato
describes a group of people in a cave chained to the wall. The only things
these people see are shadows of what’s happening behind them.
The shadows represent their reality. The reflections on the wall are the ONLY
things they believe.
Then Plato introduces the Philosopher — a person freed from chains. The
Philosopher steps outside the cave and realizes, there’s an entire world out
there.
The Philosopher doesn’t accept reality for what it is. Instead, he or she
explores other opportunities, sets skepticism aside, and understands reality
for what it can be!
People who immediately cast doubt on my SMMA program are not
necessarily wrong. They’re simply living in their own version of reality, so in
their world — they’re “right”.
Meanwhile, those who’ve “broken free” and have actually followed through
with the lessons, are seeing amazing results.
The numbers back this up.
2 years and 35,000+ customers later, I’m STILL getting success stories about
my Social Media Marketing Agency program every day.
I’ve featured some of them on this page:
(LINK)
www.clientgenerators.com

--- PAGE 69 ---
The way the SMMA program works is simple.
After investing in the program, a private username / password grants access
to 80+ online video tutorials.
The videos, made by me and other social media marketers, reveal 60+ hours
of specific and proven techniques for starting and scaling an agency.
Lessons in SMMA are designed to help beginners, so being new or
inexperienced isn’t a problem.
SMMA isn’t meant to mislead. This is why I’ve included a 100% money-back
guarantee.
I’m not going to push a hard sell on this. I’m simply making it available for
those willing to make positive changes in their life.
There’s a world of opportunity, freedom, and security out there. Those who see
it, benefit. Those who don’t, broadcast their doubt.
Living a better life is a choice.
The link below will help anyone build the lifestyle they want, instead of the one
they’ve been chained to.

A short while ago I created a special training program to teach people — step
by step — how to start their own small agency business. Since launching this
program, it’s helped over 12,000 people.
If having your own business sounds intimidating, don’t worry. Many of the
current members started with little to no social media marketing knowledge
and are still getting amazing results.
Recently a small number of people graduated from the program which
means a handful of spots opened up for new members to join.
If you’d like an exclusive preview of the program — so you can decide on your
own if it’s for you — visit this link!
(LINK)
When it comes to social media, few people know what they’re talking about. In
the program I created, I’m revealing the same strategies I’ve used to grow my
social media to:
* Over 2 billion minutes of video watched
* 10+ million followers across my social media networks
* One of the most-watched video ads of all time
What surprises people about these strategies is they’re easily adaptable —
from dentists or restaurants to fashion brands, pet shops and plumbing
services, the training I created helps you get more customers for ANY type of
business.
One of the biggest hurdles I see new entrepreneurs face today is earning their
first 6 figures. The reality is, it’s not that difficult IF you follow this advice one of
my first mentors gave me:
www.clientgenerators.com

--- PAGE 71 ---
“Tai, to figure out where you want to go, break it down into simple steps.”
This tip opened my mind to taking any BIG goal and breaking them down into
manageable steps I was able to achieve over time.
For example, if you want to make 6 figures a year, that's roughly 250 dollars a
day.
So what’s the best way to get started with earning 250/day?
There are many ways and all of them, in some way, rely on social media. I
know firsthand what’s possible when you recognize — and use — social
media; it’s how I’m able to reach over 200 million people a year.
Many people are using social media every day, but very few are wise enough
to earn income with it.
Small business owners, for example, are clueless when it comes to using
social media. This is a huge challenge for them because they realize what
impact it can have, but lack the time and knowledge to manage it
themselves.
And here’s where there’s a huge opportunity.
You can become a solution to their problem and, get paid very well as a
reward.
But how?
Let me give you the big picture — here’s the 3-step process to get small
business owners to pay you for taking care of their social media:
1. Learn social media
2. Use a proven process to get clients
3. Earn 1-10 grand a month helping small business owners
It’s really that simple.
www.clientgenerators.com

--- PAGE 72 ---
A short while ago I created a free online training that goes through the
process. The free training is designed for people who have zero experience
starting a business, getting clients, and no idea where to begin.
Thousands of people have watched the free training and some of them are
now making 30k/month with the lessons I showed them. No joke — I had my
lawyer verify their results to back this up.
The free training I created is quick, easy, and explains everything you need to
get started. To check it out, click the link below:

Some people recruit. (MLM)
Some sell other people’s products. (Affiliates)
Some Sell Gadgets on FB. (Ecom)
Some like to play with Google too. (SEO or Blogging)
We don’t do any of “that” anymore...
We now act as the Bridge between Business Owners and the Leads they so
desperately need.
This is James, and 2 years ago I ditched my MLM company, my affiliate
accounts, ecom, SEO and Blogging for the beginning of something special.
My partner, Jason and I started something called an “Agency”.
Now, I know that term isn’t used too much, but it’s the simplest way we can
explain:
How we help connect business owners to their clients with some simple ads
and a 2 Page Site.
Not gonna lie, we both wanted from our business:
-> Results
-> Dinero
-> Freedom
-> No Competition
www.clientgenerators.com

--- PAGE 74 ---
-> A Lifestyle Business
-> Help Others Get Results
-> Be Paid for making a difference in others’ lives.
That required ditching all the old shiny objects we had been “trying”.
Now all we do is, run small ads to simple 2 page sites for Local Businesses
(some right down the street from me) on Facebook and Google.
These small ads get loads of leads when done properly.
We run these small ads for tons of different niches including personal Injury
lawyers, doctors, dentists, and 24 others we have clients for.
In essence, all we're doing is acting as the middleman between their
customers, who don’t know them yet, and the business owners we work with.
Every time they get “connected” we collect a nice fee.
It’s fun, especially when our business started exploding!
The best part is this:
We get compensated for actually helping someone.
No sales, no slime, just a good ole “internet business model” that has changed
our lives and EVERY business owner's lives we work with.
If curiosity has the best of you, I recorded a free 20 minute video for you that
explains in detail how we do this.
All you have to do is insert a valid email on the next page.
(LINK)
I will be the first to admit. It all sounds too easy right?
www.clientgenerators.com

--- PAGE 75 ---
Find a business owner, out of like 23 million, who wants leads, and run small
ads to get them leads?
Then charge them EVERY SINGLE Month to continue to send them leads?
As much as I hate to admit it, I would probably call “bull” on this process if I
was reading this on my Facebook Feed.
All sounds too good to be true.
That is exactly why I shot the no-cost video.
Mainly for proof, but more importantly, you'll see I’m an honest guy. :)
Let’s say you get past the “Too Good to be True” thought.
These are the top 5 questions we always get asked, so might as well be as
transparent as I can be:
[1] Why a valid email?
I have to get you the video, plus spam is gross so no worries there. However,
from time to time you might witness results of some of our students that we
get excited to share. You can always just kick us to the curb anytime you
want.
[2] Students? Oh now it makes sense.
We do have a paid program for some people who are interested in applying
(we have had over 10,100 people already apply for it in less than 12 months)
BUT it’s not required at all. You can apply what you learn in the video without
needing to pay for any additional training.
[3] This concept makes sense but why share it then?
There are 23 million local businesses. I doubt our company or the other 1,700
students we have can even come close to helping all of them.
www.clientgenerators.com

--- PAGE 76 ---
[4] Money, time and skills are lacking. Can I still do this?
I always use myself as an example. When I started, I had no money, could
barely figure out Microsoft Excel, thought Apple computers were way out of
my league, and I had a full time job the entire time I was building my agency.
So, a little bit of everything goes a long way.
[5] Clients. How to get clients though?
We have a proven 5-layer strategy with over 8 ways to get clients including
our ‘Leads in Advance’ method. Think about how easy it would be if you gave
leads to a business owner first, then asked them if they wanted to keep the
leads coming. Sound like a ‘hard sell’’ or a common sense Yes?
[6] I’m still nervous!
Good, you should be. That is why I shot this video to educate you. Skepticism
just comes from not being informed. The video will fix that.
In case you need the link again:

Click, enter, watch…
Sound Good?
Great, see you in the video.
James
PS - Right now we have over 1,700 students and hundreds of case studies.

business.

“Oh, great.”
“Some bimbo photoshopped herself into a pool overlooking Hollywood.”
“Now she’s gonna sell me some BS biz opp.”
“For just three easy payments of $49.95.”
“And then, I, too, can live the good life!”
(*Rolls eyes*)
(*Makes jerk off motion*)
Easy, Tiger!
Look, I get where you’re coming from.
You’d rather read a brochure on buttholes than suffer through another
long-winded Facebook ad sellin’ you the dream.
Right?
So let’s clear a few things up.
FIRST:
This bimbo has a name.
It’s Jessica Samis, from:

The picture’s real.
No, it’s not our pad - Airbnb rental.
My husband Jeff and I actually live in Canada, along with our furry lil’ pee
machine, Meeko.
THIRD:
This has nothing to do with network marketing.
Been there, done that, got the t-shirt.
FOURTH:

Not yet, anyways.
Just a FREE video training teaching you the one business that always works.
(As long as *you* do the work.)
And you can get it here:

But you’ll need to enter a valid email so we know where to send it.
Okie dokie?
And…
FINALLY:
I said this is:
www.clientgenerators.com

--- PAGE 79 ---
“The one business that always works.”
I didn’t say it was easy or instant.
Or that you’d be a millionaire overnight.
So, I understand you’re skeptical.
But.
C’mon fam!
Hear me out at least.
“Okay, so… spit it out then.”
“What is it?”
“What’s the ONE business that always works?”
You ready for it?
Here it is:
It’s helping other businesses.
“How?”
Getting them leads.
“And how do you do that?”
Lots of ways.
Google, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, etc.
“So you can do it all online?”
www.clientgenerators.com

--- PAGE 80 ---
Yep, all you need is a laptop.
“Is it hard to get ‘em leads though?”
Not when you know what you’re doing.
Which is the whole point of this free video training:
(LINK)
“Are you gonna tell me how to get clients in this video?”
Sure am.
And no, you don’t have to be good at sales.
Honestly, you don’t even hafta leave the house.
So slip on your gravy pants, crack a cold one, and get comfy.
Alright?
“Now you’re talkin’, Jess! Does it matter where I live though?”
Not at all.
We’ve got thousands of students from dozens of countries.
As long as you speak English and have a hot spot, you’re good.
“But I’ve never done anything like this before.”
Perfect.
Then this free video training’s exactly what you need:
(LINK)
“How much is each deal worth?”
www.clientgenerators.com

--- PAGE 81 ---
It’ll depend on the business.
But anywhere from a few hundred to a few thousand a month, usually.
“Wait! Per Month?”
Yep, every 30 days, like clockwork.
Cuz think about it:
As long as they’re making several times what you charge… why would they
wanna stop?
(They wouldn’t.)
Which is why:
We’ve had clients paying us “rent” for years now.
“Why don’t they just do it themselves?”
They don’t have the free time.
Nor the interest in learning it.
“Okay, say I get a client - how do I take payment?”
PayPal, check, whatever’s clever.
“Will you tell me which types of businesses to go after?”
Absolutely.
Some are better than others.
Obviously, you want deals that pay you the most money for the least amount
of work.
And that’s what we’ll cover here:
www.clientgenerators.com

--- PAGE 82 ---
(LINK)
“Still! Why teach me? Won’t that make it more competitive for you?”
Ooh, good question.
Look, I’d rather cry alone in a dark room listening to sad songs on Spotify than
ruin a good thing.
I mean:
This business is everything to us.
But the fact is?
Jeff and I and an entire army couldn’t do this for every business in every city.
No way José.
So we’re okay if you wanna come along for the ride.
If so, hop in:

You’re pickin’ up what we’re putting down?
Should you ask about our do-it-with-ya program.
www.clientgenerators.com

--- PAGE 83 ---
Yes, it costs.
Less than a single client, by the way.
But you don’t have to inquire.
And you surely don’t have to buy.
It’s totally optional.
Totally up to you.
Bottom line:
You’re in control.
Fair enough?
“Guys, don’t fall for it - it’s just another scam.”
Really, Conspiracy Carl?
That hurts.

And Fred from finance is standing by your cubicle retelling the story about
that time Junior farted at Farm & Fleet.
And Susie from customer support’s laughing so loud you can’t hear yourself
think.
Well, in that case?
No worries.
Just open the email when you get home and watch it then.
Either way, as the video plays?
Pay close attention as Jeff and I melt your skepticism.
And tickle you with tidbits.
And leave ya wide-eyed and mystified, like:
“Damn, why didn’t *I* think of that?”
Before showing you the exact steps you can take to do it yourself.
And get results.
Even if nothing’s worked before.
Even if you’re short on time.
Even if money’s funny.

There's a serious problem going on in eCommerce.
Marketing and the way we do business is changing blazingly fast,
yet the "gurus" are teaching the same worn out advertising tricks.
And if you've tried running Facebook Ads for your eCommerce products using
these tactics, then I'm willing to bet the results were disappointing at best.
Lean in...
Here's the secret:
You're not the only one! The same thing is happening to every seller recycling
the same outdated strategy.
See, Facebook is probably the most well known ads platform on the planet...
Yet, it's also one of the least understood for one reason: it's interruption
marketing on a social platform.
Let me explain...
The way you've been taught to use FB Ads is like walking up to a random
stranger on the street...
And asking them to buy a set of speakers for 50% off out of your trunk.
Every once in a while a bargain hunter will take you up on the offer, but for the
most part it falls on deaf ears.
So what's the answer?
www.clientgenerators.com

--- PAGE 88 ---
Well it's simple really and you probably discovered it by the time you were 5
years old! Huh?
Once you realize we're doing business in an Empathy Economy, the answer
will be blazingly obvious to you.
This week, I'm hosting a Live webinar training where I'll reveal this strategy and
"[True Story] How My 'Its Elimination Time' Meltdown Forced Me To Build AND
Scale A Profitable eCommerce Empire...
WithOUT An Expensive Ad Agency, Getting Into Debt To Fund It, Or Being At Risk
Of Losing It All"
Once you understand this formula and why it's so effective, you'll be able to
write your own ticket...
Those who understand the new economy and adapt will win.
Everyone else will lose.
I want you to win.

Take what you know.
Package it up.
Sell it for $2k, maybe more.
Using Facebook ads, webinar, phone sale.
That’s the formula.
Urrbody knows it.
But, easier said than done, right?
Cuz it’s like:
“Well, what’s my offer exactly?”
“And would anyone actually pay $5k for it?”
“Cuz that’s what I’d like to charge.”
“But I dunno.”
“I mean, nobody’s ever heard of me.”
“I’ve got no list.”
“No case studies.”
“No momentum.”
“Nothing.”
www.clientgenerators.com

--- PAGE 90 ---
“And I need help with my webinar.”
“And setting up the calendar.”
“And syncing software.”
“And making pages pretty.”
“Plus, what about ads?”
“I’m clueless!”
“And I hate writing emails.”
“And I’d rather not do phone calls, either.”
“Hmm…”
“I know…”
“I’ll buy another course.”
“That way, I’ll at least feel like I’m getting somewhere.”
“Even though I didn’t do diddly with the last one I bought.”
“This’ll be different though.”
(Pause.)
I’ve got a better idea.
Hire us to do it all for ya.
Hey, it’s Steve, from:

- Masterminds
- Retreats
- Seminars
- Speaking
- Website design
- Whatever’s clever
Then have a seat.
And we’ll make it happen.
For a big, fat fee of course.
(That’s called “the catch.”)
But hey, if nothing else has worked?
And you’re sick and tired of trying to do everything yourself?
Maybe it’s time to consider done-for-you.
Whaddya say?

If I flooded your business with 49,000 new email subscribers each month for
free…
Could you make sales?
If I pummelled your eCommerce store with 908,000 visitors for free…
Could you make sales?
If I got 15 million people watching your latest social media promo video for
free…
Could you makes?
Heck, with this amount of traffic…
You’d be able to make HUNDREDS of sales each month.
It’s a no brainer.
And that’s why I think the key to having a highly successful online business is
in your ability to get mountains of quality traffic.
But how?
Well, if you wanted to PAY for that amount traffic through a channel like
Facebook advertising, it’d be super expensive...
But the traffic numbers I just mentioned above are what I generate for my
business every month… FREE.
Those 49,000 email subscribers? Free.
Those 908,000 website visitors? Free.
www.clientgenerators.com

--- PAGE 94 ---
Those 15 million video views? Free.
Those hundreds of sales I make every month? Free.
That’s right.
I don’t pay a dime for those monthly email subscribers, visits, views, or sales.
If you want to know how I do it, keep reading:
What you have to understand about free traffic is that it almost always fails…
Here’s why:
First, it’s usually not targeted.
And that means you put in a lot of effort for not many people clicking through.
Ever wondered why your social posts, blogs, or podcasts get low
engagement?
Well, now you know.
Second, most free traffic strategies are almost always low quality.
And that means the people who actually do click through usually aren’t
looking to buy right now, or aren’t looking to buy anything high-priced.
Do you find your site or your list full of 'lookie-loos' who never purchase?
You can blame your free traffic strategy.
Third, and probably the most frustrating…
Is that free traffic takes a lot of TIME to get it going :(
Apparently, if you want SEO to work for you now, you have to publish
HUNDREDS of articles per WEEK!
www.clientgenerators.com

--- PAGE 95 ---
Yowza.
No thanks.
So that’s why if you’ve been in business for any length of time, you’ve
probably pulled your hair out more than once trying to get your free traffic
strategies working…
But what if there was a way to generate free traffic that…
*** Put your business in front of the RIGHT prospect every time…
*** Put your business in front of prospects when they’re ready to buy, and
most important…
*** Put your business in front of hundreds of thousands almost INSTANTLY…
If you could generate THAT type of free traffic for your business…
Do you think you’d be able to make a few sales?
Do you think you’d be able to build a super successful business online?
If so, I’ve got some great news for you…
That’s exactly what I’ve done.
I’ve ‘cracked the code’ to generating mountains of high-quality traffic right for
FREE right from Facebook fan pages.
And yes, there’s NO spending any money on ads, and it works great even with
Facebook recently reducing the reach of your fan page social posts…
This is a strategy I’ve used to build my email list to more than 354,871
subscribers…
It’s a strategy that I use to generate huge income on autopilot…
www.clientgenerators.com

--- PAGE 96 ---
And, it’s a strategy hundreds of my students have duplicated for their own
success.
(With many of them having NO online or business experience before using it!)
The name of that strategy?
“Fan Page Domination”
The place where you can learn it in depth for free?
This link:
(LINK)
In today’s free workshop I take you by the hand and reveal to you how I built a
massive online business from one free Facebook fan page.
Even better, this is a strategy you can duplicate for your own business, or if
you’re just getting started…
You can use it to launch you own successful online business without spending
a ton on ads or other marketing.
Here’s everything you’re going to learn:
• A reliable, predictable method for growing your fan page (for free) so you
aren’t wasting money on things that don’t work…
• A simple way to sell other people’s stuff if you don’t have your own
products/services…
• How to “ethically bribe” fans into joining your email list (and develop a
relationship with them so they trust you and buy from you)...
• The specific strategy I use to turn free Facebook traffic into long-term
SUSTAINABLE revenue streams (which makes a great lifestyle possible)…

• How to generate income WHILE you grow your fan page - so you don’t have
to wait for “someday”...

You’ll also get an e-copy of my book “3 Simple Steps To Building Your
Profitable Fan Page Business”.
Read through it (and take notes!) before class starts to get the most out of
the experience.
I look forward to seeing you there.

Everything popular is wrong
I just finished "The 4-Hour Work Week" by Tim Feriss and wanted to share the
profound lesson that is referenced often in this book.
When I first read 4-Hour Work Week it was like a gateway drug to
entrepreneurship.
I was still in a 9 to 5 job that I flat-out hated. The ideas of self empowerment
and reimagining our relationship to income were so radical I was hooked
immediately.
I looked around at my life and I had done everything that everyone told me to
- I went to college, I got a job, I worked my 9-5 and partied on the weekend.
It sucked.
Everything popular is wrong.
Oscar Wilde said it, and Tim repackages this argument brilliantly in a way I
couldn't ignore.
Fast-forward today, I just reread this book and realized I didn't appreciate this
idea enough the first time around. In April, I made over $780,000 on Facebook
Ads alone. In 2017, I was featured in Forbes 30 Under 30 and since I first read
the book I've been able to building the (LINK)entrepreneurial community
network to over 7,000 active members.
The popular idea to building a business in 2018 goes something like this:
Get a nice, expensive website, write a ton of content with researched
keywords, build an extensive network of qualified professionals for referral
domains and back links, figure out Facebook ads, get a ton of Instagram
followers…
www.clientgenerators.com

--- PAGE 99 ---
It keeps going.
I see this idea everywhere, and it's just wrong.
The generalists forages for everything and finds nothing, but the specialist
wins in their arena more than anyone else. The only thing that matters in the
market is providing real solutions because it provides real value.
This idea has helped me reimagine my workweek to a point where I have it
down to a science. After reading this book again, I realized I can teach anyone
else to do the same - but only if they really want it.
I put together a free workshop that will show you exactly how I went from
living and working out of my parents garage when I first read Tim's book to
how I run (LINK) from my loft & office in Manhattan.
I will be giving away a free workbook at the end of it that will help you apply
the principles you will learn in it directly to your life and you will see 1 single
online marketing funnel that has made me over $50,000,000 in sales.

As I write this…
It's 6pm on Friday here in NYC…
How was your week?
Did you make progress towards your goals?
Or... Was it more of the same?
In life and business, there's no such thing as maintenance. There's no such
thing as staying where you are.
Stagnation is death. You're either moving forwards or falling backwards.
If you're happy stagnating where you are, here's the link for Netflix: (LINK)
It'll help you kill the time and numb the reality of your situation.
But, if you can't stand staying where you are, and you want to constantly
improve and grow…
I've got something for you.
Something that can help you figure out:
"What is my purpose, what do I do in this world?"
I asked myself the same question 7 years ago.
I did what every normal kid does and I asked my parents and I asked my
friends and their parents and then I asked the career advisor at my school…
I got pretty much the same advice.
Something to this effect:
www.clientgenerators.com

--- PAGE 101 ---
"If you want to be successful in life, if you want to be happy, then you should
go to school. You should get good grades, then you should go to college, you
should get good grades and then you should get a job, a corporate job, and
then work your way up the corporate ladder, save your money and then buy a
house, work for 40 years, have a family, then you can retire to a beach
somewhere at 65”
And I was like well…
Who am I to challenge this path?
This is what everyone told me, so this must be what you should do.
So I went out and I did just that.
And then one day I ended up in this corporate cubicle at this company called
Vodafone back in New Zealand and I thought, is this really it?
Is this what the rest of my life is going to be, just commuting to and from this
cage, sitting here clicking on Keynote and Excel.
Having meetings where no one's really saying anything, but we just keep
talking anyway and you know, drinking a lot of coffee.
Stressing out about work politics and feeling like I had to pretend to be a
certain way…
It sucked.
It got to the point it was so painful I was like…
“Screw it. I'm going to quit and start my own business.”
And so that's what I did.
I dropped out of college. I quit my job.
I'd no idea what I was doing and I really floundered around for the first year
because:
www.clientgenerators.com

--- PAGE 102 ---
A) I wasn’t thinking differently and I didn’t have a profitable business idea
B) I was unfocused and couldn’t stick to anything for more than a few months
Fast forward five years…
I’m on the Forbes 30 Under 30 list.
What changed?
I’d like to show you.
Right now, I'm holding a free training which shows you how I started a
consulting business from scratch and found a predictable process that
helped me land 2-3 clients per day in the first year.
It’s the exact same process I still use today to run my business even though
it’s much larger now.
Even more important…I’ll show you how I went from not being able to
concentrate to finding deep focus each and every day.
This won’t be your typical training…
You’ll learn
1. How to pick a niche, how to find your focus, how to find your one thing.
2. How to become a different person (really)
3. How to take someone from a total stranger who's never heard of you
before, ever to a high paying customer with just 1 phone call.
So click the link below and get registered for this free training. And I look
forward to seeing you there.

Answer this question honestly: Besides your paycheck, what does your job
give you?
Does the work you do fulfill you?
Most people get nothing out of their job besides income, socializing with their
coworkers, happy hours, a few benefits. Their job is the thing they do so they
can have a life - but they spend more time at their job than they do anywhere
else.
If you ask most businesses why they exist besides making money, they
probably won’t even have an answer.
The framework society constructed around employment and compensation
requires us to trade our time for money under the agreement that the sole
point of business is to generate revenue.
It’s not just boring - it’s soulless.
At the end of this most recent quarter, I took a vacation to Tulum with my wife.
While spending sometime away from the hustle in New York, I took time to
reflect on what I do and, more importantly, why I do it.
While there, I ran into my student Andrew Argue. Andrew is now one of the
most successful accounting consultants in the world and is about to
transcend to earning 8 figures annually. He was telling me about when he
was in high school and how he lead a movement to change the way the
school was operating financially. He now has hundreds of students of his own,
and we were talking discussing the feedback we get from our clients when he
said something that really stuck with me:
“I think what the best thing about working with you is that you helped me do
what I truly love doing - and make more money doing it than I could
anywhere else. And the funny thing is, the thing I hear the most from my
students is that by starting their own consulting firm, they feel like they got
their life back.”
www.clientgenerators.com

--- PAGE 104 ---
He then said: “You should really consider opening up that free training again.
The 2 hours I spent on that training absolutely changed my life.”
The more I thought about it, the more I realized Andrew and I love the same
thing. We occupy complete different niches, but the true satisfaction we get
from our work comes from the fact that we are in the business of giving
people something the corporate 9-5 took from them - freedom.
I’ve trained thousands of people how to start their own consulting firms, and
3,217 of them are now completely financially independent and have quit their
jobs.
What I love most about my work is that I am in the business of changing lives.
I help people create 6 to 7 figure businesses from anywhere in the world - all
they need is a laptop and phone. The results are just astonishing, and they
keep me working 12 hours a day, 6 days a week, even though I don’t
necessarily need to.
Take Brittany Brown - She started helping people with binge eating and is
changing lives and making more than she ever dreamed. She will become a
millionaire this year.
Take Wilkens Ferville - Wilkens knew nothing about digital marketing and was
working long hours in a factory. He knew there was something more to life,
and after joining the program found out that he was actually quite gifted in
ecommerce. Now, after making making more than double his yearly salary in
a few months, Wilkens is looking to teach more people how to do what he
does.
Take Hunter Otis - Hunter was working at a sales job he hated, and when he
quit his boss laughed at him. Since then, Hunter has gone to help couples fix
their marriage and help men overcome porn addiction. The results are simply
astonishing - upon hearing what he was doing, his boss got back in contact
with him. Fast-forward to today, and his boss now works for him!
To put it simply, life is more than money. But money is so important.
I love my job because it is more than money, but because I set my goals on
creating real change, I have made a ton.
www.clientgenerators.com

--- PAGE 105 ---
When I got back to NYC, I realized Andrew was right.
I’m going to re-open the same free training that helped him, Brittany, and
Hunter.
I am not going to open this for long - just until space fills.
If you’re ready to change your life and become financially independent, it
starts with this free training. It’s long and in-depth, but it’s worth it. At the end
of the training I’ll be offering a free workbook that will help you apply these
ideas to your life immediately.

I just finished watching Marie Forleo's "Marie TV" where she interviews author
Ryan Holliday.
They had a phenomenal conversation about the advantage of sacrificing
immediate gratification in favor of pursuing the longterm benefit.
Forget about quick wins - go for greatness.
Everything in the conversation was fascinating, and I highly recommend
watching the episode. Marie's insight reminded me of someone - someone
who happens to run the richest company in the world.
When I first read Jeff Bezos's 1994 Letter to Shareholders I saw the same
principle that was even communicated similarly to Marie's ideas on her show.
Bezos is probably the best example of longterm thinking the world has ever
seen - 25 years ago, when Bezos first laid out his vision for Amazon, he set out
on a path that he has literally never wavered from.
Everything he talks about in the '94 Letters to Shareholders has come fruition
two and a half decades letter. Bezos's obsession with the longterm is evident
by all the goals he sets out - he completely neglects the quick wins and
makes sacrifices in the short term in order to win in the longterm.
He never deviated, not for a moment.
When I first set out to be an entrepreneur, I struggled greatly until I mastered
this principle, but arrived at its conclusion indirectly.
5 years ago I was in my parent's garage in New Zealand. My initial journey into
financial independence was frustrating. I kept failing with ideas I thought were
really good - and I couldn't understand why.
Until one day, it clicked - my ideas were good, they just weren't valuable.
The only thing people really care about is true value.
www.clientgenerators.com

--- PAGE 107 ---
Fast-forward to last year, and I made Forbes 30 Under 30 List, I started (LINK)
and now run it out of our office on Madison Avenue in Manhattan. We also
have an office in Ireland, and have helped over 3,000 people become
financially independent in 4 years.
Why am I telling you this?
I want to give value away for free because I believe it is the best longterm
strategy for my business.
If you're interested in starting your own business and becoming financially
independent making 6 figures from anywhere in the world, or if you already
have a business and are looking to go to the next level, I put together a free
workshop that will show you 3 things:
1. Pick a niche. The generalist chases everything and gets nothing - but the
spoils go to the specialist. Find one area you can beat everyone in and you
will make more money than you can imagine, and I will teach how to
generate a laser focus capable of hypnotizing your niche and dominating.
2. Change who you are. I know, that sounds insane. But the reality is that if you
had what you needed to be where you wanted to be, then you would already
be there. The reality is that business is 50% tactics and 50% mindset, and I will
explain in detail how I went from a lazy, insecure wannabe to running a
business that makes $100k per day. To put it simply - I had to change who I
was on a fundamental and instinctive level. Once you do this, your rise to the
next level will become effortless.
3. How to turn a total stranger into a high-paying client paying $2k+ per
month with a 45 minute phone call. I'm going to completely pull the curtain
back - I'll show you exactly how I run Facebook ads, the funnel I use, the sales
script, calendar, everything.
You will learn how to convert complete strangers in without any followup, no
cat and mouse, just one simple 45 minute phone call.
Why am I giving this to you for free?
Because I trust in the process.

"Those that can't do...teach"
Agree or disagree?
From someone who has been on both sides…
...I say this truthfully.
I didn't just sit down in front of my computer, and make some stuff up so I
could sell it on the internet and retire on a beach.
That's what a lot of people do.
A lot of people make a course or program purely so they can make money.
They rush it. They make the program in two days. It's not tested or proven, and
they have little care for the results people get.
What happens is they make money, but at the cost of their reputation.
Not a good long-term strategy.
The most important thing to me is the results people get.
I'm not trying to make people feel good with my training.
If that were the purpose, people would feel good in the short term when
completing this course and bad in the long-term.
I know in order to have long-term happiness and success, the things which
we have to go through now are a little bit challenging.
But this is my life's work.
It's taken me my entire life to figure all this stuff out.
www.clientgenerators.com

--- PAGE 109 ---
Since I bring in $20MM annually from a single course/program each year…
...people often want to know the secret to making the “funnel” work.
All together, there are 7 things I found I do completely different than the
average course creator that led me to have massive success.
I go over it all on this free training:
7 Steps To 7 Figures With Your Coaching, Consulting Or Service Based Business
To Your Success,
- Sam
PS - Now, this training is made for people who are already getting clients or
experts in their field.
If you’re just dipping your toes into entrepreneurship…
I have other resources for you but this training is specifically about making a
transition from servicing “done for you” to a highly leveraged, course model.

It's hard to believe that Kylie Jenner's cosmetic line Kylie has sold over $630
million in a few years.
The even more shocking part?
She's 20, and she owns 100% of the company.
Say what you want about her coming from money and already being famous,
you don't just accidentally get to $630 million in sales.
When the article publishes, Jenner will be 21, and will grace the cover of Forbes
as the youngest self-made female billionaire in history.
The Kardashian/Jenner clan is long, but Kylie has stood out at a remarkably
young age.
How did she do it?
In the interview Jenner goes on to explain that though she knew the
cosmetics industry was fiercely competitive, she saw two annoying problems:
1. It's a hassle to go to the store to buy makeup. ESPECIALLY if you already know
what you're looking for.
2. The current system of producer to retailer to customer put a needless step
in the process. Of course, the retailer marked up the product, and women
have to pay more for the product.
Everyone Jenner knew told her that the market space was too difficult to
enter, but Jenner was passionate about her project from the beginning.
The industry had a problem, and she was going to solve it.
Only 3 years later, Jenner has amassed over half a billion in sales and owns
100% of a company with a ridiculous valuation.
www.clientgenerators.com

--- PAGE 111 ---
She ships $29 lip kits she sells directly to the consumer without a retailer in the
middle.
She also has eyeshadows, lip liners, and other accessories.
To most people it looks like Kylie was just born on top, but the reality is she did
something a lot of successful entrepreneurs have been doing recently.
In reality, they create a system to beat the system.
They set out to solve a genuine problem and in doing so created a genuine
advantage, and then used savvy online marketing to use that advantage and
deflate old, bloated companies of the past.
Survival of the fittest.
The reason I was so impressed with Kylie's tactics and phenomenal success is
because I share the exact same philosophy in my business.
5 years ago, I was broke, living in my parent's garage without $60k in student
loan debt I took to go to college I dropped out of.
Just like people didn't care if they were buying from a "respected" brand like
Gillette, I found that people didn't care if I had a fancy website, a large social
media following, or even if I had any clients.
All they cared is that I could solve their problem - and they'd happily pay me if
i could.
I found a system to beat this system.
This system is so powerful I put together a free training that will teach anyone
how to become a 6 figure consultant from anywhere in the world.
Doesn't matter if you have a degree, a website, an existing business, or
anything. All you need is a laptop, a phone, and a true desire to solve
problems and change your life.
