WHEN YOU HIT
“STAGE 5: PRODUCTIZE”
You’ve grown to 10-19 employees! Around 2.4 million businesses reach this level. You’re now a “Director”
with your first 2-3 managers under you. This is when your original product is doing well, but that’s not
enough anymore. Your main challenge? You need a second product to keep growing. Specifically,
you need to extend LTV - aka - you need to make more per customer. This gives you the cash to
scale advertising and recruit even higher level people to your team to keep the growth coming.
THE BIG CHALLENGE: ONE PRODUCT ISN’T ENOUGH
The biggest problem at Stage 5 is that customers buy your product, but then they have nothing
else to buy from you. They might even leave (churn) because they need other things you don’t offer.
That’s why it’s called the “Productize” stage - you need to create new products to sell to your existing
customers. Let’s look at what’s happening:
Products and Sales
Marketing and Customers
Tech and Data
People and HR
Money Matters

$100M SCALING ROADMAP • STAGE 05: PRODUCTIZE PERSONALIZED GUIDE
Products & Sales
• Customers have nothing else to buy from you after their first purchase
• You need to connect customer service with product development

Marketing and Customers

• Your marketing needs to be more targeted
• Customer support is inconsistent - different people give different answers
• You need a proper playbook for customer service

Tech and Data
• Employees are using their personal computers and software
• When people leave, they take company information with them
• You need company-owned computers and software
• You need a way to track leads and customers
• You need dashboards to show important numbers
People and HR
• It’s hard to find managers and higher-level employees
• You should promote good employees from within when possible
• You’re firing people incorrectly and could get in trouble
• You need proper termination policies
• You need ways to encourage employee referrals
Money Matters
• You don’t know how much money you can reinvest in growth
• You need a real budget
• You need simple financial forecasting
• You need to track tax write-offs better

THE BOTTOM LINE
STAGE 5 IS ABOUT GOING FROM “ONE-HIT WONDER” TO HAVING
MULTIPLE SUCCESSFUL PRODUCTS. YOU CAN’T GROW JUST BY
SELLING MORE OF THE SAME THING. YOU NEED TO:
CREATE NEW SELL MORE TO MAKE EVERYTHING SET UP PROPER
PRODUCTS EXISTING CUSTOMERS MORE PROFESSIONAL SYSTEMS
This is when your business starts feeling like a real company that could keep growing for years. Instead of just doing one
thing well, you’re building a business that can do several things well.
WHY IT’S CHALLENGING: BUT IT’S WORTH IT BECAUSE:
• Making a second product is hard • You can sell more to existing customers
• You’re still fixing problems with the first product • You reduce risk by having multiple products
• Everything needs to become more professional • You build a stronger, more valuable company
• You need to spend money to grow • You create paths for future growth
REMEMBER
The key to Stage 5 is balance. You need to keep your • Make sure it’s truly needed
first product running well while creating something new. • Price it well (usually higher than their first product)
You need to stay profitable while investing in growth. You • Keep the first product running smoothly while

If you can master this balancing act, you’ll have

• Test it with their best customers

WHEN YOU HIT
“STAGE 4: PRIORITIZE”
Welcome to having 5-9 employees! About 3 million businesses reach this level. This is when you
change from being a “trainer” to becoming a real “manager.” You’ll have your first real team, with
one layer of organization between you and the front-line workers. The big difference? You can’t do
everything anymore - you have to choose what matters most.
THE BIG CHALLENGE: TRYING TO PLEASE EVERYONE
The main problem at Stage 4 is that you’ve been saying “yes” to any customer who would pay
you. Now that’s causing problems because different customers want different things. That’s why it’s
called the “Prioritize” stage - you need to figure out who your best customers are and focus on them.
Let’s break down what’s happening:
Products and Customers
Marketing and Sales
Customer Service
Tech and Tools
People and HR

$100M SCALING ROADMAP • STAGE 05: PRODUCTIZE PERSONALIZED GUIDE
Products & Customers

• You need to update your product to serve just those ideal customers

Marketing & Sales
• You’re getting too many unqualified leads (people who aren’t right for your business)
• You need to create better free content to attract the right people

and how many people buy

• You need to start tracking customer satisfaction
• Customer information is scattered everywhere
• You need a proper system (CRM) to keep track of customer notes and interactions
Tech and Tools

• You need to get everyone on the same platforms
• You need to protect passwords and data
• You need project management and team chat tools
People and HR
• You’re wasting time interviewing people who aren’t right for the job
• You need to learn how to interview properly and check references
• Employees don’t know basic rules about time off, dress code, etc.
• You need to create an employee handbook with basic policies
Money Matters
• You keep getting surprised by “one-time” expenses
• You’re learning that running a business costs more than you thought
• You need proper profit and loss statements

THE BOTTOM LINE
STAGE 4 IS ALL ABOUT FOCUS AND PRIORITIES.
YOU CAN’T SERVE EVERYONE, AND YOU CAN’T DO
EVERYTHING. YOU NEED TO CHOOSE WHAT’S MOST
IMPORTANT AND FOCUS ON THAT. THIS MEANS:
PICKING SAYING SETTING CREATING MEASURING
YOUR IDEAL NO TO UP BASIC CLEAR WHAT
CUSTOMERS OTHERS SYSTEMS RULES MATTERS
This is when your business starts feeling like a real company instead of just a group of people working
together. It’s when you stop trying to please everyone and start focusing on being really good at
serving specific types of customers.
REMEMBER
The key to Stage 4 is learning to say “no.” No to customers want to build something bigger in the long term. About 3

WHEN YOU HIT
“STAGE 6: OPTIMIZE”
You’ve grown to 20-49 employees! About 2.1 million businesses reach this level.
You’re now a “Leader” with a full team of managers under you. The interesting
thing about this stage? Your main challenge isn’t doing more—it’s doing
everything better. You have two products, but they both need improvement.
THE BIG CHALLENGE:
EVERYTHING COULD BE BETTER
The biggest problem at Stage 6 is that having more people doesn’t automatically
make things work better. Things are actually getting less efficient. That’s why it’s called
the “Optimize” stage—you need to make everything work better, not just bigger. Let’s
look at what’s happening...

STAGE 6 IS ABOUT MAKING EVERYTHING WORK BETTER,

PEOPLE OR DOING MORE THINGS, YOU NEED TO:

• Fixing things takes time and money • You waste less money
• You have to change how things work • People are more productive
• People resist change • You can grow without breaking things
• You have to invest in improvement without
immediate payoff
REMEMBER
The key to Stage 6 is patience. Making things About 2.1 million businesses have mastered this

You have to: • Focus on one improvement at a time
• Find what’s not working well • Measure results carefully

• Test it • Document everything
• Train people • Make sure changes stick

THE SECRET
TO SUCCESS
THE REAL SECRET TO STAGE 6 IS REALIZING THAT
“BETTER” BEATS “MORE.”
DON’T DO THIS DO THIS INSTEAD
Hiring More People Train Current People Better
Adding More Products Improve Current Products
Getting More Customers Serve Current Customers Better
Adding More Tools Use Current Tools Better
If you can make this shift from “more” to “better,” you’ll build a stronger
business that’s ready for even bigger growth.
Remember, at this stage, success isn’t about doing more—it’s about getting
more for what you do.
