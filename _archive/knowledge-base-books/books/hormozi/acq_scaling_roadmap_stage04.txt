WHEN YOU HIT
“STAGE 4: PRIORITIZE”
Welcome to having 5-9 employees! About 3 million businesses reach this level. This is when you
change from being a “trainer” to becoming a real “manager.” You’ll have your first real team, with
one layer of organization between you and the front-line workers. The big difference? You can’t do
everything anymore - you have to choose what matters most.
THE BIG CHALLENGE: TRYING TO PLEASE EVERYONE
The main problem at Stage 4 is that you’ve been saying “yes” to any customer who would pay
you. Now that’s causing problems because different customers want different things. That’s why it’s
called the “Prioritize” stage - you need to figure out who your best customers are and focus on them.
Let’s break down what’s happening:
Products and Customers
Marketing and Sales
Customer Service
Tech and Tools
People and HR
Money Matters

• You need to choose a specific type of customer to focus on
• You need to update your product to serve just those ideal customers
• You might need to raise your prices to match your specialized service
Marketing & Sales
• You’re getting too many unqualified leads (people who aren’t right for your business)
• You need to create better free content to attract the right people

and how many people buy
Customer Service

• You need to start tracking customer satisfaction
• Customer information is scattered everywhere
• You need a proper system (CRM) to keep track of customer notes and interactions
Tech and Tools

• You need to get everyone on the same platforms

People and HR

• You need to learn how to interview properly and check references
• Employees don’t know basic rules about time off, dress code, etc.
• You need to create an employee handbook with basic policies
Money Matters
• You keep getting surprised by “one-time” expenses
• You’re learning that running a business costs more than you thought

THE BOTTOM LINE
STAGE 4 IS ALL ABOUT FOCUS AND PRIORITIES.
YOU CAN’T SERVE EVERYONE, AND YOU CAN’T DO
EVERYTHING. YOU NEED TO CHOOSE WHAT’S MOST
IMPORTANT AND FOCUS ON THAT. THIS MEANS:
PICKING SAYING SETTING CREATING MEASURING
YOUR IDEAL NO TO UP BASIC CLEAR WHAT
CUSTOMERS OTHERS SYSTEMS RULES MATTERS
This is when your business starts feeling like a real company instead of just a group of people working
together. It’s when you stop trying to please everyone and start focusing on being really good at
serving specific types of customers.
REMEMBER
The key to Stage 4 is learning to say “no.” No to customers want to build something bigger in the long term. About 3

WHEN YOU HIT
“STAGE 3: STABILIZE”
You’ve made it! You have your first 1-4 full-time employees. About 24% of businesses (around 7
million companies) reach this level. This is when you go from doing everything yourself to having real
employees. Your role changes from “doer” to “trainer” because now you have to teach others how to
help run the business.
THE BIG CHALLENGE: TOO MUCH WORK, NOT ENOUGH TIME
The main problem at Stage 3 is simple - there’s way too much work for one person to handle. That’s
why it’s called the “Stabilize” stage. Everything feels a bit chaotic and you need to make things more
stable. Let’s look at what’s happening in each part of the business:
Products and Customers
Sales and Service
Tech and Tools
People and HR
Money Matters

$100M SCALING ROADMAP • STAGE 04: PRIORITIZE PERSONALIZED GUIDE
Products & Customers
• Your biggest headache is that you can’t fix everything customers complain about
• You have to pick the ONE thing that bothers customers the most and fix just that
• Your leads (potential customers) aren’t buying as quickly because they don’t know
you as well
• You need to start sending emails and creating content to build trust over time
Sales and Service
• You’re wasting time talking to people who aren’t serious about buying
• You need to make a list of what makes someone a “good” potential customer
• New customers often feel lost when they start using your product/service
• You need to create a proper way to welcome and guide new customers
Tech and Tools
• You probably bought too many different software tools thinking you’d use them all
• Now you need to figure out which ones you actually need and cancel the rest
• You should try to extend free trials or get discounts on the tools you keep
• You need a basic system to track your sales pipeline
People and HR
• It’s hard to find good people to hire
• You need to learn how to write good job descriptions and review resumes properly
• You’re probably not handling employee taxes correctly
• You need to get a payroll service to handle taxes and fees properly
Customer Service
• People are getting paid informally (which isn’t good)
• You need to set up proper payroll processing
• You need basic bookkeeping to track money coming
in and going out
• You need to manage invoices and payments properly

WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS
LIKE AT STAGE 3
Your job is to move from doing everything yourself to having a small team that can help run the
business. Here’s what you need to do to graduate from Stage 3:
Fix Your Biggest Problem First
• Don’t try to fix everything at once
• Find the #1 thing customers complain about
• Fix that one thing really well
• Then move on to the next biggest problem
Get Your Money In Order
• Set up proper payroll for employees
• Start using basic accounting software
• Make sure you’re tracking all money coming in and going out
• Have a system for managing bills and getting paid
Help Your Team Help You
• Write down how you do important tasks
• Train your team members properly
• Give them the tools they need to do their jobs
• Check their work to make sure it’s done right
Make Your Customers Happy
• Create a proper way to welcome new customers
• Make sure they know how to use your product/service
• Help them get results quickly
• Keep in touch with them regularly

THE BOTTOM LINE
STAGE 3 IS ALL ABOUT GOING FROM
CHAOS TO STABILITY.
You can’t do everything yourself anymore, and that’s okay!
Your job is to build a small team and teach them how to help
run the business. Focus on fixing the biggest problems first,
setting up proper systems for money and employees, and
making sure customers get good results.
If you can get through this stage, you’ll have
a real business with real employees, not
just a one-person show. It’s hard work, but
about 7 million other businesses have done it.
YOU CAN TOO!
REMEMBER
Don’t try to fix everything at once. Pick the biggest problem, fix it well, then move on to the next one.
That’s how you stabilize a growing business.

WHEN YOU HIT
“STAGE 5: PRODUCTIZE”
You’ve grown to 10-19 employees! Around 2.4 million businesses reach this level. You’re now a “Director”
with your first 2-3 managers under you. This is when your original product is doing well, but that’s not
enough anymore. Your main challenge? You need a second product to keep growing. Specifically,
you need to extend LTV - aka - you need to make more per customer. This gives you the cash to
scale advertising and recruit even higher level people to your team to keep the growth coming.
THE BIG CHALLENGE: ONE PRODUCT ISN’T ENOUGH
The biggest problem at Stage 5 is that customers buy your product, but then they have nothing
else to buy from you. They might even leave (churn) because they need other things you don’t offer.
That’s why it’s called the “Productize” stage - you need to create new products to sell to your existing
customers. Let’s look at what’s happening:
Products and Sales
Marketing and Customers
Tech and Data
People and HR
Money Matters
21

--- PAGE 22 ---
$100M SCALING ROADMAP • STAGE 04: PRIORITIZE PERSONALIZED GUIDE
Products & Sales

Tech and Data
• Employees are using their personal computers and software

• You need company-owned computers and software
• You need a way to track leads and customers
• You need dashboards to show important numbers
People and HR
• It’s hard to find managers and higher-level employees

• You need ways to encourage employee referrals
Money Matters

professional. Here’s what you need to do:

THE BOTTOM LINE
STAGE 5 IS ABOUT GOING FROM “ONE-HIT WONDER” TO HAVING
MULTIPLE SUCCESSFUL PRODUCTS. YOU CAN’T GROW JUST BY
SELLING MORE OF THE SAME THING. YOU NEED TO:
CREATE NEW SELL MORE TO MAKE EVERYTHING SET UP PROPER
PRODUCTS EXISTING CUSTOMERS MORE PROFESSIONAL SYSTEMS
This is when your business starts feeling like a real company that could keep growing for years. Instead of just doing one
thing well, you’re building a business that can do several things well.
WHY IT’S CHALLENGING: BUT IT’S WORTH IT BECAUSE:
• Making a second product is hard • You can sell more to existing customers
• You’re still fixing problems with the first product • You reduce risk by having multiple products
• Everything needs to become more professional • You build a stronger, more valuable company
• You need to spend money to grow • You create paths for future growth
REMEMBER
The key to Stage 5 is balance. You need to keep your • Make sure it’s truly needed

You need to stay profitable while investing in growth. You • Keep the first product running smoothly while

new ones.
If you can master this balancing act, you’ll have
About 2.4 million businesses have figured out this a business that’s built to last and ready to grow
balance. The ones that succeed usually: even bigger.
• Start small with their second product
• Test it with their best customers
