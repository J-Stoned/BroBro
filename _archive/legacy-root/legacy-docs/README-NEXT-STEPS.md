## Next Steps (The 10 Developer Way Forward)

### ✅ Steps 1-3 COMPLETE
- [x] Audit 6 existing commands
- [x] Define universal template
- [x] Specify all 227 commands in CSV

### ⏭️ STEPS 4-10 (Ready to Execute)

**Step 4: Create Generation Script**
- Create `scripts/generate-commands.py`
- This script reads the CSV and generates command files

**Step 5: Generate All 227 Commands**
- Run the script
- All 227 `.md` files created in `.claude/commands/ghl-whiz/`

**Step 6: Enrich Commands**
- Polish generated commands
- Add real examples
- Fix any issues

**Step 7: Build Smart Search**
- Create `/ghl-search` command
- Create `/ghl-command-finder`
- Make discovery work

**Step 8-10: Navigation, Registry, Deploy**
- Build command organization
- Create metadata
- Deploy to production

## How to Execute

### Option A: Quick Path (Recommended)
```powershell
# 1. Use Claude to generate the Python script
# 2. Run the script to create all 227 commands
# 3. Polish + deploy
```

### Option B: Manual Path
```powershell
# 1. Open commands-specification.csv
# 2. For each command:
#    - Copy template
#    - Fill in from CSV
#    - Create markdown file
```

## What You Need

- Python 3.8+ (for script generation)
- VS Code or similar editor
- 1-2 hours of focused time

## The Big Picture

This setup allows you to:
- ✅ Build 100-200+ commands systematically
- ✅ Generate thousands of command variations
- ✅ Maintain consistent quality
- ✅ Scale infinitely

## Ready to Start?

1. **Which step do you want to tackle first?**
   - Build the generation script?
   - Manually create more commands?
   - Something else?

2. **What's your preferred approach?**
   - Automated (Python script)?
   - Manual but controlled?
   - Hybrid?
