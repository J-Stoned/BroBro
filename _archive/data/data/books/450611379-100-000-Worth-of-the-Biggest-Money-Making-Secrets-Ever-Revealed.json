I’m su re you’ll recognize many of these opportunities.\nYou may have even invested in them. I truly hop e that the information I reveal helps you (even\nthough it may make me unpopular with th e people selling these opportunities.)\nMail Order Marketing\nMail order marketing generates billions of dollars in cash for both large and small\ncompanies alike. One of my marketing friends in Kansas has a company that does 99% of its\nmarketing through the mail and generates roughl y $800,000 to $1 million dollars each and every\nmonth. That’s $9,600,000 to $12 million dollars a year by mail order. As a side note, in the late\n1980’s this gentleman was a down-on-his-luck carpet cleaner who discovered information\npublishing, started his own mail order bus iness with $300, and has since made over\n$100,000,000 selling information by mail.\nMail Order Secret #1:\nTo be completely frank, ma il order is NOT a business.\nMail order is a delivery method for your marketi ng messages. It’s the same thing as calling a\nbusiness on the Internet an “Int ernet business”. Even though the Merck pharmaceutical company\nadvertises on television, most people don’t refer to them as a “Television Business”. And while\nmost furniture stores advertise in the local news paper very few of them are called “Newspaper\nBusinesses”. You may want to promote your products  or services by mail, but that doesn’t make\nit a mail order business. This is a clarification that’s important , because I’ll be talking about\nvarious business opportunities throughout this book that ca n ALL be promoted by mail.\nMail Order Secret #2:\nThere is a proven system to ma king money in mail order.\nYou find a specific niche market that can be reached by mail, and you sell them something for\nwhich they’re HUNGRY. For example, you can go online to SRDS.com (or to your area’s largest library) and find the Standa rd Rate and Data Services direct ory of direct mail lists. Inside\nthat directory are mailing lists of all types of groups. You can find mailing lists for people interested in arts and craf ts, dogs, cats, skydiving, mountai n climbing, business opportunities,\nKarate, fly fishing, antiques, and painting. Ther e are mailing lists of people who subscribe to\ncertain magazines, have purchased items off of  TV, who attend college, and who drive certain\ntypes of cars. There are literally  thousands of different mailing lis ts available to you. The key is\n7 to find a mailing list of customers who WANT so mething and deliver that particular product or\nservice to them.\nOften, someone will come to me with a pr oduct that “Everyone needs”. That normally\nspells disaster. Why? Let’s take a look at products that “Everyone needs”. Maybe it’s\ndishwashing detergent, or laundry detergent or  something along those lines. Where do these\ncompanies advertise? Do they mail out direct mail sales letters or place ads in small niche magazines? No. These companies spend millions upon millions of dollars selling their products\nto the masses. Their full-page ads (many costing $25,000 to $50,000 or more) in monthly magazines drive people to local grocery stores and discount chains to buy  their products. That’s\nthe problem with having a produc t that “Everyone needs”. You ’re not able to focus your\nmarketing efforts on a small niche market. You’re forced to spend millions of dollars promoting your product on TV, Radio, and in major magazi nes. And most people don’t have the deep\npockets to do that. And if you DO have a hot “m ass market” product, stand back because people\nwith BIGGER, DEEPER pockets th an you are likely to rush in, steal your basic idea, and launch\nit before you have a f oothold in the market.\nThe secret to success with ANY mail order busi ness is to target a smaller NICHE market\n- a group of people who all have the same intere st. Making money. Real Estate. Fishing. Weight\nLoss. Health. Whatever. Next, they  MUST be easy to reach either through direct mail lists that\nyou can purchase or magazines to which they all subscribe. And finally, you need to create or\nfind a product that this niche group WANTS (not needs, WANTS) , and sell it to them. It’s a\nsimple formula for success, but one that many new mail order marketers don’t understand.\nNow, here’s The ADVANCED Mail Order Marketing Formula:\nWhenever you’re starting your mail order campaign, you need to realize that the target market\ndoesn’t know or trust you yet. So trying to get them to fork over $100, $250, even $500 for a\nproduct, course, service, whatever  is going to be incredibly diffi cult. Most mail order marketers\nsell a low-cost or even free “Front-End Offe r”... maybe a booklet, report, audio CD, trial\nsubscription... so that the prospect has very lit tle risk involved in their purchase. Because their\nrisk is low, they’re more likely to take a chance with you. Then, once they’ve purchased from\nyou, it’s important that you PROVE YOURSELF to  them by giving them more than they\nexpected. How you deliver the first product is going to give them an idea of the quality of ALL\nof your products and your customer service philo sophy. Make sure to give a great impression.\nThen, once you’ve proven yourself to your buyers you can mail additional offers to them, selling\nthem higher-priced products.\nIn direct response marketing, it’s known as  the “Marketing Funnel”. Imagine a funnel.\nYou “pour” in thousands of buyers at the top of the funnel using free or low-cost offers. Once\nthey’re in the funnel, you sell them higher priced products. Y ou’ll discover that fewer and fewer\ncustomers will buy as the price rises. So as your  customers move DOWN your funnel, you’ll sift\nand sort until you get to the bottom of the funne l and have a small number of very, very high-\nquality customers who may pay you thousands of  dollars for seminars or live coaching. The\nproducts at the top of the funnel are free or in expensive. The products at the bottom are very\nexpensive. So as people move down the funnel, you get fewer and fewer people willing to shell\n8 out larger and larger amounts of money. But you also end up with a very high-quality group of\nbuyers as they move through your marketing funnel.\nMail Order Secret #3:\nCreate (or find) a product or s ervice ONLY AFTER you have\nfound a market that is easy-to-reach (usua lly via mailing lists or magazines).\nThe biggest mistake that people ma ke is finding or creating a produc t first and then trying to find\na market to sell it to. Often the person believes (t hrough very little or no actu al research) that the\nproduct will sell because “everyone needs it” or “ I’m sure people will buy it”. However, once the\nproduct has been completed, after much time, e ffort, and money invested, the entrepreneur\ndiscovers that either there’s no market for the pr oduct or that there might be a market that can’t\nbe easily reached through a specifi c mailing list or magazine. Often it’s much better to do a little\nresearch, find a mailing list or magazine that reaches a target market, and then create a product\nthat this market wants. Do that a nd you have a recipe for success.\nHow do you find out what a particular market  wants? SEE what they’ve already bought.\nThe mailing list companies will tell you what th ese customers have purchased before and how\nmuch they spent. Or you can look through the magazines at what your competition is selling.\nMake sure to check through old c opies of these magazines and, if  the same ads run year after\nyear, it’s a pretty good bet that the ad work s and the product being so ld is popular. There’s\nnothing wrong with creating anot her product based on an already winning product. Just try to\nmake yours better, easier, faster working, etc.\nMail Order Secret #4:\nMany companies that sell by mail are willing to break even or even\nlose money selling what is norma lly known as a “front-end” product.\nA front-end product is the first pr oduct a new buyer purchases from  you. It’s usually a low-cost\nor free product or service that gives the prospe ct the opportunity to buy something from you with\nvery little risk and gives you th e opportunity to prove to the ne w buyer that you’re a legitimate\ncompany that delivers on its promises. The real secret behind most mail order companies is that\nthey rely on the LIFETIME VALUE of a customer . Instead of trying to get rich selling a low-\ncost product or service, they’re happy to lose m oney on the first sale, beca use they realize if the\ncustomer is happy with their initial purchase, th ey’ll be back to purchase from them again and\nagain and again. Some customers may continue to purchase from a company for many years,\neven decades. So losing $5 to gain a custom er who ultimately purchases $50,000.00 in products\nor services from you over a 10-year lifetime is a very cheap investment. The most successful\nbusinesses that sell by mail understand the importanc e of a strong “back-end” marketing strategy\nand continue to mail their customers additional pr oduct offerings on a regular basis. In fact, it’s\nbeen said that mailing to your customer database  more often (at least once a month) creates a\nbond with the customer and actually increases the chance they’ll purchase from you in the future.\nMail Order Secret #5:\nDo not buy mailing lists from ads in op portunity or money-making magazines.\nEven though the prices might be cheaper and (as I’ve seen recently) you can double, triple, even\nquadruple your order FREE, you normally end up getting the lowest-quality names possible. And\n9 with what you’ll be investing in printing and postage to mail out your direct mail piece, you\ndefinitely want the best mailing lists possible. You can get very high-quality, reasonably-priced\nmailing lists from experienced mailing list br okers by going to SRDS.com or going to your\narea’s largest library and asking for the Standard Rate and Data Services Mailing List Directory.\nDo not skimp on your mailing list. It’ll be  one of the best investments you’ll make.\nMail Order Secret #6:\nCount money, not response rates or “undeliverables”.\n“Undeliverables” are mail that the U.S. Post O ffice returns to you, becaus e it can’t be delivered\nto the addressee, due to a bad address, forwar ding order expired, etc. Often, people new to mail\norder marketing get caught up counting the wr ong numbers, such as the number of\nundeliverables that are returned to you or the percentage of the peopl e from the list who buy.\nRemember, you can’t deposit response rates. You can only deposit money. So, for example, let’s say that it costs you $5,000 to mail out 5,000 letters to a mailing list. And let’s say that you get\n50% undeliverables – and only 1% of the pe ople who receive your le tter actually buy your\nproduct. Horrible, right? Not necessarily. Le t’s say that your produc t sells for $500. A 1%\nresponse rate from 5,000 letters mailed, but only 2,500 delivered would pull in 25 orders. Do that\nmath – and you’ll see that’s $12,500.00 in gross sa les. Even if you subtract your $5,000 mailing\ncost, you’re still way ahead. It’s important to focus your time and energy on counting the\nnumbers that matter. The dollars. The other numbe rs are interesting to measure, but you should\nalways keep your eyes first and foremost on how much money your mailings are pulling in.\nMail Order Secret #7:\nKnow Your Math BEFORE Mailing and\nMake it Work with SMALL NUMBERS!\nThis is a BIG SECRET! Many mail order market ers understand that no ma tter how incredible\nyour sales letter is and no matte r how wonderful the mailing list broker says their list is, your\nresponse rate for any offer might only be 1% or LESS! Smart marketers change their pricing to\nwork with small numbers. For example, let’s say it costs you $5,000 to mail out 5,000 letters to a\nmailing list you’ve purchased. That covers the cost of renting the list (mos t lists are rented for\none-time-use only), postage, and printing the sale s piece and envelope. Now let’s say that you\nonly get 1% to purchase your product. If your product is $25, you’ve onl y made $1,250. You’ve\njust lost $3,750. If your product is $100, you’ve made $5,000. You’re  at break even. (Actually,\nyou will have some cost to fulfill your product, bu t for this example, let’s assume you have $0\nproduct cost). But, if your product is $250, the exact same 1% response rate pulls in $12,500.\nSubtract your $5,000 mailing cost and you’re ahead by $7,500! It’s the same list, the same cost\nto mail all 5,000 people but by changing your pric ing you’ve gone from losing money to making\nmoney. In the past I’ve sold products for up to  $1,000, where I could cover all of my marketing\ncosts with as little as ½ of a 1%  response rate. Before you mail your first letter, make sure you’ve\ndone the math. If it doesn’t work out make any necessary changes until the math does work out.\nSmart marketers price their products and set up thei r marketing systems to be successful with the\nsmallest response possible. Then, if response is  bad, they’ve made money. And if response is\ngreat, they’ve made a big PILE of money. Either  way, they’ve reduced their risk to almost\nnothing.\n10 Mail Order Secret #8:\nYour best list is your HOUSE LIST!\nNo matter what mailing list broker  you rent lists from, your best list will always be your in-house\nlist of BUYERS. The people who have purchased from you before are more likely to purchase\nfrom you again (providing that you’ve given th em good value for their money), rather than\npeople from a “cold list” who have never hear d of you before. You’ll always get a better\nresponse by mailing new product or service offers to your in-house list of buyers than a new list\nyou rent. In fact, many smart mail order marketer s will test new product offers on their in-house\nlist before mailing it to an outsi de list. If the product isn’t a success being mailed to the in-house\nlist, the marketer knows it will probably sell poorly  to an outside list. Always remember to go\nback to your own customer list again and again on a regular basis with new offers.\nRecommended Reading\nHere are two books on mail order marke ting that I highly recommend. You can\nfind them at your local bookstore or online at Amazon.com\nHow I Made $1,000,000 in Mail Order-and You Can Too!\nBy E. Joseph Cossman  How to Get Rich in Mail Order\nBy Melvin Powers\nInformation Marketing\nInformation marketing is, in my opinion, one of  the best, most exciting, most profitable\nbusinesses you can run. An information marke ting business sells products (books, courses,\nbooklets, manuals, DVD’s, CD’s, seminars, workshops , coaching, etc.) to a specific niche market\n(i.e. opportunity seekers, gardeners,  business owners, hobbyists, etc.).\nThere are many, many benefits to running an information marketing company. First are\nthe high profit margins of information products. Mo st info-marketers mark-up their products 8 to\n10 times. If a book and 6 audio CD’s cost $30 to pr int and duplicate, the marketer will normally\nsell it for $250 to $300. Because people value th e INFORMATION inside an info-product and\nnot the value of how it’s delivered, it’s easy to se ll low-cost info-products for very high dollar\namounts. And if you deliver high-quality informa tion, your customer won’t argue with the fact\nthat the info-product was re latively cheap to produce.\nAnother benefit is the fact that information is easy to ship. It’s  easy to box and mail,\naround the country or around the world. Online, it’s even easier. You can create and sell an info-\nproduct that the customer downloads directly from your website so th ere’s no printing or\nshipping costs for you. One of my Internet websit es, at www.inforiches.com, sells a book that I\nwrote years ago called The Ultimate Million Dollar Idea Generator . When someone purchases\nthat book, money is deposited into my account inst antly and the customer is taken to a webpage\n11 where they can download the e-book. I never have to stock or ship the product. This has been a\ngreat extra income stream for my business.   Most of my marketing friends are informati on marketers. Many of them are millionaires\nor multi-millionaires. Why? It’s because the demand for quality information in a variety of areas is at an all-time high. We’re smack-dab in th e middle of the “Information Age” and the demand\nfor information doesn’t seem to be slowing down.   For example, let’s take infomercials. At the time I’m writing this book there are a number\nof info-products being sold on television. Carlto n Sheets is selling his “No Money Down” course\non how to get rich in Real Estate. Russ Whitne y, John Beck, and Ron LeGrand are also selling\nreal estate info-products on TV. There’s a guy se lling a course on how to make money on eBay.\nAnd another guy, Jeff Paul, showing people how to make money by... guess what... SELLING\nINFORMATION PRODUCTS!\nThere are other marketers selling information products on the Internet and by mail.\nYanik Silver  makes millions of dollars every year showing people how to get rich on the\nInternet. John Reese , another Internet marketing expert, made over $1 million dollars in just\nONE DAY, selling a $1,000 info-course on how to get traffic to your website.\nSydney Johnston  sells information on how to make money on eBay – and pulls in\nmoney daily from her website business.   John Lyons  sells information on how to train hors es – and has become one of the most\nhighly respected horse trai ning experts in his field.\nAdam Katz  sells information on how to train your  dog. He’s been doing this for years –\nand pulls in a considerable amount of cas h from dog owners every single year.\nJoe Polish  sells information to carpet cleaners th at teaches them how to generate more\nmoney through smart marketing. He’s made millions  of dollars – and continues to pull in money\nhand-over-fist. In fact, he curr ently sells a carpet cleaning coac hing program that costs about\n$10,000.00 a year – and it’s very popular!\nDan Kennedy  sells information to direct response marketers that shows them how to be\nmore effective and make more money. Dan has not  only made millions himself, but many of his\nstudents are also multi-millionaires in the inform ation marketing field. One such success story is\nJeff Paul , a struggling financial planner who went from living in the basement of his relative’s\nhome – to making $200,000 a month in his own info-publishing business. Today, he’s a multi-millionaire... having even sold his in fo-products on home-shopping powerhouse, QVC!\nJerry Baker  sells information to gardeners on how to  create and keep a beautiful garden.\nHis information empire pulls in money for him like steel to a magnet.\n12  And these are just a few “Success Stories” of people getting very  wealthy selling in-\ndemand information products. The information ma rketing is huge – and growing by leaps and\nbounds. We’re in the middle of the information age – and people are willing to spend big bucks\nfor the right information. In this  section, I’ll reveal se crets that will help  you create your own\ninformation marketing business.\nInformation Marketing Secret #1:\nYou do not want to sell bookstore books.\nTo make any decent money selling information pr oducts, you must sell larger info-products, like\ncourses, toolkits, audio CD or DVD sets. There is really very little, if any, money in creating a\nbook for a bookstore. Unless you’re the next St ephen King, your chances of becoming a multi-\nmillion dollar author with mass-market books is  pretty unlikely. Your best opportunity for\nsuccess in selling information pr oducts is to create higher-end products ($250 to $500 courses or\n$500 to $1,000 CD or DVD packages) and sell them  to a niche market. Joe Polish has made\nmillions of dollars selling an expensive, high-doll ar course to carpet cleaners teaching them how\nto effectively market their se rvices and generate more inco me. Chauncey Hutter has made\nmillions of dollars selling a high-dollar course teaching “Mom and Pop” tax preparers how to create more revenue. If you’re going to sell in formation products, you want to keep away from\nthe $15 to $20 books (unless th at’s your front-end product – th at leads them to buying your\nlarger, high-dollar back-end product) and focu s primarily on more expensive information\nproducts.\nIMPORTANT NOTE:\n$15 to $20 books are normally “loss leaders” that can be\nused to pull people into your marketing f unnel. They’re tools to  draw people into\nyour business – so you can then sell th em higher-priced products. Bookstore\nbooks can also be used as another way to  generate free leads that you can then\nconvert to higher-dollar buyers. Dan Ke nnedy, for example, has marketing books\nin all of the major bookstores. However, Dan uses them as a way to create an\ninitial bond with his readers and gets th em to take action and purchase more\nexpensive information products  directly from him. They’re not a major income\nstream but simply a tool to drive ne w prospects into his marketing funnel.\nInformation Marketing Secret #2:\nYou DO NOT have to create the information product yourself.\nOften the reason people don’t get involved in the highly lucrative in formation marketing\nbusiness is that they don’t thi nk they’re an expert in anything,  so they have nothing to write\nabout. The biggest myth in the information marketing business is that you have  to be an expert in\na field and write the product yourself. You don’t. In fact, I’m part of a group called the $100\nMillion Dollar Roundtable. It’s a group of about 10 marketers w ho have collectively generated\nover $100 million dollars in sale s. Every week we do a teleco nference and interview other\nexperts and record the calls. Curr ently we’re interviewing real esta te experts. At the end of our\nrecordings (which take a few weeks), we’ll have 8 to 12 audio recordings of our group\ninterviewing experts in real  estate. We’ll have a comple ted audio product (with printed\ntranscripts) that we can eas ily sell for $500 to $1,000. And none of us in the group have to be\nexperts in real estate. We simply find the expe rts, ask for just one hour of their time for an\ninterview, and, like magic, we have a product.\n13 You can do the same thing. Find an expert, interview them by phone, and record the\ninterview. With a cheap tape recorder, a connector  that attaches your phone  to your recorder, and\nsome blank tapes, you can start creating products  in no time flat. (NOTE: While some experts\nwill let you interview them out of ego alone [Yes, we all want to feel important], other experts\nwill only do the interview if you allow them to ta lk about their products toward the end of the\ninterview and give their contact information. Sin ce this information is us ually provided within\nthe last 5 minutes of your interview, it doesn’t di stract from the quality of the overall discussion.\nIt’s a small gesture to get a va luable product created that you can  sell for years and years to\ncome. Ultimately, it’s a win-win situation for both yourself and the expe rt you’re interviewing.\nAnother way to get instant produc ts is to purchase the reprint or resale rights for existing\nproducts. I personally like this method of getting new products because reprint and resale right\nproducts normally come with proven sales material s. Instead of having to write your own (or hire\nsomeone to write a letter for you), you can get a ready-to-go, tested and proven sales letter that\nworks. The only challenge with purchasing reprint and resale rights to a product is that they can\nbe expensive. Some companies charge as mu ch as $10,000 for the license to their products.\nHowever, if you have a clear idea of how a partic ular product will be used in your business and\nyou know it will generate more income than the co st of the license, it may be a good investment.\nIMPORTANT NOTE:  I cover the “secrets” behind re print rights later on in this\nbook. Please read it carefully before  purchasing any reprint rights.\nInformation Marketing Secret #3:\nThere’s a simple system to making  money by selling information.\nI described it in detail in the section on mail order marketing, but it’s so important I’m going to\ncover it again here.\nImagine a funnel. It’s wide at the top a nd narrow at the bottom. Your information\nmarketing business is like this funnel. You fill up your funnel with prospects by offering low-\ncost (or even free) products or services. A booklet, a trial subscription, a 10-minute coaching\ncall, whatever. You offer this low-cost or free “front-end” product or service to get as many\ninterested prospects into your ma rketing funnel as possible. Then, your business “sifts and sorts”\nyour prospects – as you offer them more products.\nFor example, as you go back to your mailing lis t with higher-priced offers you’ll find that\nfewer people will buy them. The people who DO buy them are your higher-quality customers.\nLet’s say that you fill your funnel with 1,000 pe ople by offering a free report. Then, when\nyou go back to your prospects with a $250 offer, only 250 of those people make the purchase.\nYou’ve just “sifted out” your be st prospects – and made $62,500. Now let’s say that you go back\nto the 250 people who bought your $250 offer and you make them an offer for a $1,000 live seminar. This time only 75 people buy. These 75 people are now even better customers and you’ve generated $75,000. Go back to those 75 pe ople with a $2,500 offer (maybe 6 months of\npersonal coaching) and you may find only 25 people take you up on your offer. Now, at the\nBOTTOM of your funnel, you have the best-o f-the-best customers – and you’ve made an\nadditional $62,500.\n14 You started with 1,000 people at the TOP of your  funnel, sifted and sorted them with\nvarious offers, and at the BO TTOM of your funnel you have 25 amazing customers and you’ve\nmade a total of $200,000.00 in gross sales. Now you simply keep the process going. You\ncontinue “pouring” people in to the top of your funnel, unde rstanding that only a certain\npercentage will buy each additional product from  you until only the best customers reach the\nbottom of your funnel and buy your most expens ive product. These customers will normally buy\nanything and everything from you as long as you continue to deliver value.\nMarketers like Dan Kennedy, who have an in credibly loyal following, have customers\nwho have been with him for years and years a nd buy everything he produces. At a recent seminar\nhe mentioned that he has a few customers who have  asked him to keep their credit cards on file\nand anytime he comes out with a new product,  he has permission to  charge their card\nautomatically and send the product to them, si ght unseen. Now those are LOYAL customers!\nADVANCED MARKETING SECRET:\nIn the marketing funnel example explained in  the previous secti on, you “poured” 1,000 people\ninto your business and by offering them 3 individual products you generated $200,000.00 in\nsales. Obviously, with these numbers, you’ll wa nt to continue pouring people into your\nmarketing funnel non-stop. After all, just 5,000 pros pects in this example would equal $1 million\nin total sales.\nHowever, there’s another lesson to be learne d here that I discovered from the guy I call\nthe “$100 Million Dollar Man”, T.J. Rohleder. Let’ s do some simple math and divide the amount\nof gross sales from our example by the numbe r of prospects. So we divide $200,000 by 1,000 –\nand come up with $200. Basically, on average, each new prospect is worth roughly $200. (Of\ncourse, this is a very basic example, because  it doesn’t take into account any additional\nmarketing or fulfillment costs. But for the sake of getting the basic concept across, let’s forget these additional expenses). If  the overall value of each new customer is $200 from your first 3\nsales, HOW MUCH MONEY are you willing to  spend to get ONE NEW PROSPECT???\nMany marketers make the mistake of going cheap  and trying to get prospects with little\nor no investment. They end up shooting themselves  in the foot, because they end up with very\nfew new prospects. If you know over time that the average value of a prospect is consistently\n$200, you can easily spend $50, $100, even $200 to get a NEW PROSPECT! (Yes, you can spend ALL of the profit IF you plan on selling them additional items while they’re on your\nmailing list). If you accept this idea, you can NOW  do marketing that other marketers simply\nwon’t do.\nImagine being able to send a special le tter OVERNIGHT FEDEX! Attaching a $10, $20,\neven $50 bill to a letter! Sendi ng an Audio CD... or a DVD... or a set of them... to grab the\ncustomer’s attention.\nIn the late 1980’s, I knew of a company that  sent out a HUGE Information Package to all\nprospects, with over 6 HOURS of audio recordings. The packages must have easily cost $10 to\n$15 each to send. But they were selling a very hi gh-end package. So they knew the numbers and\nrealized they could spend A LOT OF MONEY on prospects to create a new customer. If YOU\n15 know your numbers and you think this way, you can do a lot of marketing that your competition\ndoesn’t realize it can do.\nInformation Marketing Secret #4:\nContinuity Profits must be a component of your business.\nIn just the last 10 years or so information mark eters have discovered the importance of creating a\ncontinuity income in their bus inesses. A “continuity” product (o r service) is something that\nyou’re billed for on a regular basis, usually mont hly or quarterly. For example, some newsletter\nsubscriptions charge you every month. On the Internet, autoresponder services and website\nhosting services are normally charged every si ngle month. These products and services are\nknown as “continuity” offers.\nCreating continuity products and services for your inform ation marketing business is\nincredibly important because it becomes an automatic cash flow for your business. In the past,\nbefore continuity, information marketers relied on having to sell and re-s ell to their customers\nagain and again while incurring larg e marketing expenses to do so. Today, with continuity offers,\ninformation marketers can sell their customers one time and get paid for a product or service\nevery single month for years. If  you plan on selling information, it’ s important that you look into\ncreating and promoting continuity products.\nInformation Marketing Secret #5:\nCreate multiple income streams.\nA table with one leg won’t stand up. A table wi th two legs will wobble and fall over. A table\nwith three legs is sturdier and can stand up if the legs are positi oned correctly. A table with four\nlegs is strong. (And, continuing this analogy, a table with 20 legs can hold many times its own\nweight). In the information marketing business,  the products and servi ces you sell are like legs\non a table. If you’re selling just one product,  your business is weak. For example, when 900\nnumbers were big back in the early 90’s a lot of companies made millions of dollars selling books and courses on how to cash in on this new technology. However, very quickly, the 900\nboom turned into a bust and people quickly m oved out of that industry. If you were an\ninformation marketer ONLY selling info-products  on how to get rich with 900 numbers, your\nbusiness would have taken a very steep nosediv e. Smarter information marketers don’t build\ntheir businesses around one product. They create many, many products and services to sell to\ntheir customers. This way if any product b ecomes obsolete the busin ess is still strong.\nWhen creating your information marketing busine ss, it’s smart to build a wide variety of\nincome streams into your company. For example,  let’s say that you’re selling information\nproducts on how to make money on the Internet . You can have books and courses on how to do\njust that. You can interview experts on Internet marketing and sell the recorded interviews on audio CD. You can do joint ventures with other companies on the Internet and sell website\nhosting, website design services, autoresponders , software, and merchant accounts. You can\ncreate 20, 50, even 100 different streams of inco me, all pulling cash into your business. And the\nmore income streams you have, the stronger you r business will be. If anything happens to an\nincome stream you’re still generating cash and can replace the missing income stream with\nsomething else without t oo much stress or worry.\n16 Information Marketing Secret #6:\nMany experts make MORE MONEY selling information\nABOUT how they make money than using their actual secrets.\nLet me ask you a question: If you were making $10 million dollars a year buying and selling real\nestate but only $100,000 a year selling info-pr oducts, on which would you focus more time and\nenergy? Buying and selling real estate, right? Have you ever wondered why people like Carlton\nSheets, Ron LeGrand, Russ Whitney, and others w ho sell real estate information products are\nselling their secrets instead of keeping their se crets to themselves and making millions in real\nestate?   Here’s the Truth:\nSelling information CAN be MORE  PROFITABLE than actually DOING the\nthing you’re teaching people how to do. For example, there’s a very, VERY popular\ninternationally respected author with a line of  very popular investment  books that tells his\nreaders that THE NUMBER ONE WA Y to make money is in real estate. His very first book, a\nbest seller, focused on how he learned to get rich in real estate. Now, is that true? Absolutely.\nYou can make a lot of money in real estate. People have done it, are doing it, and will do it in the\nfuture. However, this author told a journali st recently that he makes THE MOST MONEY\nselling his books, tapes, and seminars RATH ER THAN WITH REAL ES TATE! He’s getting\nrich selling information on HOW to make money in  real estate! So “infor mation marketing” wins\nagain! My advice is this:\nDO what the millionaires DO, not what  they say. I’m not saying that you\nshould discount what they say. Many of these in formation marketers are e xperts in their fields,\nand they have made a lot of money with the ideas that they’re sharing, whet her it is real estate,\nthe Internet, or starting a business. However,  many of them are making even MORE MONEY\nselling their secrets through books, courses, manuals, and live seminars! Often it’s MORE\nPROFITABLE to sell information than DOING th e thing you’re teaching people about in your\ninfo-product. (Of course if you can do both, you’ll really be “in the money”!)\nReal Estate\nYou’ve probably seen the “r ags to riches” success storie s of people who’ve found real\nestate and turned into multi-millionaires. Ron LeGrand was a dead-broke, 35-year old auto-mechanic – who discovered real estate at a local seminar. He  immediately made $3,000 in his\nfirst 3 weeks of using the real estate investi ng methods he discovered – and quit his job. Today,\nhe teaches his real estate met hods all across the United States.\nCarlton Sheets, fired from his job, turned to  real estate investi ng as well. He not only\ncreated a personal fortune with real  estate, he also went on to crea te one of the best-selling real\nestate courses on TV, No Money Down. Today, the infomercial selling his real estate course has\nbeen running for 20 years! And he shows no signs of slowing down.\nReal estate investing is an exciting field for a number of reasons. First, it’s all around\nyou. Wherever you live- whether it’s in a house, c ondo, duplex, or apartment – is real estate that\nsomeone owns. Second, the profits from buying and se lling real estate can be quite large. I’ve\nheard many, many success stories from real es tate investors pocketing $100,000 to $500,000 or\n17 more on different deals. Even people with litt le experience and no mone y have found ways to\npocket $5,000 to $20,000 on real estate deals. And fi nally, TV, radio, magazines, and the Internet\nconstantly feature success stories of  real estate investors. People like Donald Trump only fuel the\ndreams of people who want to quit their jobs and become mega-rich in real estate.\nSo it’s no wonder that there’s a huge interest in real estate investing and a large number\nof experts and seminar companies willing to f ill this demand with books, courses, workshops,\nand coaching programs. In my own area free real estate seminars come through almost monthly.\nAnd next month, a huge real estate  expo will be held with some of  the world’s best known real\nestate investors giving keynote sp eeches. There seems to be no end in sight for the demand for\nreal estate investing information.\nReal Estate Secret #1:\nUnderstand that the “Success Stories”  you see on TV are the “best-case scenario”.\nIf you’ve seen an infomercial selling a course on “How to Get Rich with R eal Estate”, the entire\n30-minutes is filled with success stories from ha ppy people beaming about their success in real\nestate while holding up big checks. During a 30-minute infomercial you might see 10 people\nwith “success stories” – all pleased-as-punch to ha ve gotten rich in real estate. Please understand\nthat for every 1 person that makes it rich in  real estate, there are 100... 1,000... maybe even\n10,000 people or more who got the exact same c ourse, the exact same information, and never\nmade a dime.\nNow, to be fair, that’s not al ways the fault of the real esta te information being sold. Often\nwhen someone gets a real estate course and th e truth sinks in (translation: It’s much more\ndifficult than you think – and you’ll have to sp end a lot of time and energy finding and making\ndeals), they’ll set the course aside to “get back to later”. Sometimes  the “fear” of having to talk\nto people and investing some of  their own money to make deals work is enough to keep people\nfrom taking action.\nYou must understand that the “S uccess Stories” are from peop le who did the work. I’ll go\nover this again a little later, but remember that  these testimonials are fr om people whom actually\nTOOK ACTION. When you see their smiling faces as they hold up a check, understand that\nyou’re seeing the end result. They’re not show ing you the amount of time it took them to learn\nthe system. They’re not showing you the mistakes  and frustration. They’re not showing you the\nproblems and challenges they faced. They’re showing you the best-cas e scenario and hoping\nyou’ll believe it’s just that fast and easy. (B y the way, this is a good lesson to understand about\neverything you see. Most ads show you the PO SITIVE OUTCOME you want , not the effort and\nenergy it took to get to that outcome.)\nReal Estate Secret #2:\nYou will  need a basic knowledg e of Real Estate.\nThe more you have the better. You cannot jump into real estate and become a millionaire without\nhaving a basic understanding of real  estate concepts. Successful real  estate investors have their\nown language and terminology that most peopl e don’t use and wouldn’t understand. To be\nsuccessful as a real estate inve stor, you must learn and fully understand the most common real\n18 estate terms. Fortunately, most real estate course s include a glossary of terms. However, before\nyou even invest in a high-dollar real estate course you may want to go to your local library or\nbookstore and pick up a book on the fundamentals of real estate. You’ll bu ild a strong foundation\nfor future real estate investing and be able to understand many more expensive real estate\ncourses you may choose to invest in  later. If there are local con tinuing education classes on real\nestate investing, you may also want  to invest a little time and energy taking a beginner’s class\nlike Real Estate 101. You’ll quickly understand the basics and be ready for the more advanced\ninformation you’ll learn from the real estate experts.\nIMPORTANT NOTE:\nYou do NOT have to be a realto r to invest in real estate.\nIf you already have your realtor’s license or want to get it, you’ll be slightly ahead\nof any beginners without that  training. However, many, ma ny very successful real\nestate investors have never taken the n ecessary classes to become a realtor.\nThey’ve picked up everything they need ed to know from books, courses,\nseminars, and life experience.\nReal Estate Secret #3:\nThere are many, MANY ways to make money with real estate.\nThese include flipping, wholesaling, apartmen ts, commercial property, etc. Before you start\ninvesting in real estate, you’ll want to investig ate each of these types of investing methods and\nchoose the area that appeals to you the most. Because real estate  investing IS a business, you’ll\nfind very quickly that it does ta ke time and effort to get st arted. I was interviewing a very\nsuccessful real estate investor recently and he mentioned that he put 40,000 miles on his car in\none year just by driving around town looking fo r homes in which to invest. He’s a very\nsuccessful real estate investor, but he’s only successf ul because he puts in the time and energy\nnecessary to succeed.\nBecause it is a business, you need to find th e RIGHT real estate investments for you. For\nexample, you might love buying run-down homes, fixing them up yourself, and re-selling them\nfor a hefty profit (known as “flipping”). If that ’s something you love, you’ll find yourself more\nsuccessful doing that rather than buying and ma naging apartment buildings. On the other hand, if\nyou HATE the idea of renovating homes but like th e idea of creating positive cash flow with\napartment buildings, it makes no sense to try to “flip” homes. There are so many ways to make\nmoney with real estate that you should do your research, find an area of real estate that really\ngets your blood pumping, and focus your energy in that area. You’ll discover that during the\nlearning curve, or whenever challenges arise, yo ur passion for your real estate business will keep\nyou from wanting to quit.\nReal Estate Secret #4:\nLearn FIRST... But Don’t Learn Forever!\nWhile real estate investing is exciting, it can al so be intimidating. You’re entering a field where\nyou’ll be making deals for tens of thousands, hu ndreds of thousands, and, in some cases, even\nmillions of dollars. You’ll be dealing with te nants and management companies. You’ll be\ndealing with mortgage companies and banks. Y ou can, of course, minimize your risk. And many\nreal estate experts can show you ex actly how to get started in real  estate with very little or no\n19 money and start seeing profits and cash flow. It’s easy to be overwhelmed and to let this feeling\nkeep you from moving past the “learni ng” stage into the “doing” stage.\nRecently I was on a teleconferen ce with David Lindahl, an expert in buying and selling\napartment houses. During the call, I mentioned that many people are intimidated when it comes\nto getting into real estate. I asked him how peopl e can get past their fear  and become successful\nusing his methods. The answer he gave me was right on the money. He said that to get through\nfear you need “education and experience”. You n eed to have the confidence that comes from\nunderstanding what you’re doing. You need to learn the in’s and out’s of the area of real estate in\nwhich you’re investing. You need to learn from th e mistakes of others before you go out and try\nyour hand at real estate.\nBUT education itself will never be enough to  make you wealthy in real estate. You\nMUST get started at some point (even if it’s a small first step) and take action. There are many\npeople who have read many books on real estate a nd attended a multitude of real estate seminars\nwho may consider themselves experts, but they ’ve never been able to  bring themselves to\npurchase their first piece of pr operty. You can get caught up in ge tting too much education and\nnever get started. The key is to strike a bala nce between the two. You need enough education so\nthat you can confidently get started and take  the right action. And, as you take action, you’ll\ndiscover that you are completely capable  of making money in real estate.\nReal Estate Secret #5:\nBe prepared to work!\nYes, it’s exciting to see “Success Stories” of real people all ar ound the country getting rich with\nreal estate. They trot these succ ess stories out on TV and at real  estate “seminars” that travel\nfrom city to city. However, these people (and th e experts themselves) had to put in a lot of time\nand energy to get the checks they’re flashing.\nWhen I received Carlton Sheets’ “No Money Down” Real Estate Course (which I bought\nfrom his infomercial), I immediately popped in the video that shows Carlton going through the\nnewspaper, looking for deals, and making calls to prospective home sellers . From the infomercial\nI suspected that he’d make one or two calls, find a deal, make a deal, and, within the short video,\nhave generated another $25,000 to $50,000. After a ll, that’s the basic idea I got from the\ninfomercial. “Get your local paper, make a few calls, find a deal, and cash in fast!”\nWell, by the time I finally got tired and turn ed off the video Carlton still hadn’t found\nanyone in his local paper with whom to do a deal. People weren’t home. Their homes didn’t\nmeet his criteria. And he just kept dialing and dialing and dialing. “Wow,”  I thought. “Real estate\ninvesting is just like anyt hing else. It’s WORK!”\nAnd that’s what I hope you take from this. Real estate investi ng is WORK. You will\nspend a lot of time calling people and, at times, not finding one property on which to do a deal. You will spend time in your car looking at homes. You may put thousands of extra miles on your\ncar as you wheel around town. And you may have to  analyze dozens, even hundreds, of homes\nbefore you find ONE property on which to make a deal.\n20 Don’t get me wrong. I’m very, very gung-ho about the financial potentia l of real estate. I\nknow that it’s an incredibly lu crative method of building wealth. However, it’s often pitched as a\nseemingly “overnight” way to make a ton of mo ney. It’s important that you understand that once\nyou get started, you will spend a good amount of  time hunting down deals and doing a lot of\nlegwork before finding something that will make you money. (Of course, you could make a deal\nwith the first person you contac t, but I wouldn’t bank on it.)\nJust go into your real estate  business with both eyes ope n. Understand that, just like\nANYTHING that has the potential  to make you wealthy, you w ill end up putting in time and\nenergy to make it successful.\nReal Estate Secret #6:\nAll real estate experts were beginners at one time!\nNo one was born a real estate e xpert. Ron LeGrand was a 35-year old, dead-broke auto mechanic\nwhen he went to a real estate  seminar and stumbled onto the “b reakthrough” that would change\nhis life. Today, he’s a multi-millionaire real estate investor who teaches his real estate investing\nmethods to people from all over the world. Today’s real estate experts, Carlton Sheets... Robert\nAllen... Russ Whitney... Louis Brown... Wright Thur ston... even Donald Trump... all started with\nNO BACKGROUND or EXPERIENCE buying or selli ng real estate. They ALL had to learn it\nfrom scratch. They ALL made mistakes. They ALL had challenges and frustrations. But they\nALL stuck with it and made mone y in real estate. Some milli ons. Some, like Mr. Trump, made\nbillions. Knowing this, you should feel comfortabl e and confident to dip your own toe into the\nreal estate investing “pool”, ge t some education, start at whatev er level you feel personally\ncomfortable starting at, and move in a positiv e direction. Soon, you can be making good money\nin real estate.\nReal Estate Secret #7:\nBeware the “Sample and Sell” Trick.\nOne last “secret” before I move on. Even though I’ve mentioned quite a few names of real estate\n“gurus”, I want you to understand that that’s no t an endorsement of any individual expert. I’ve\nonly given their names because you might have s een them or purchased something from them.\nSome of the shadier real esta te experts use a trick I like to  call “Sample and Sell”. Here’s\nhow it works: The real estate expert gives you just enough information to  get you excited about\ninvesting in real estate. To r eally make money, he says, you need to buy my course. Fair enough,\nright? Unfortunately, the $500 course you bought only gives you 75% of the information you\nneed to successfully invest in real estate. Th e expert returns with a new offer, promising you\neven MORE INFORMATION (the secrets left out previously)at a $2,500 seminar. You’re a\nserious real estate soon-to-b e investor, so you spend $2,500, attend the seminar, but only come\naway with 85% of the information you need. Once again, the expert return s and says that what\nyou really need is to come to the NEXT  SEMINAR or maybe buy LIVE COACHING for\n$5,000. And the cycle never stops. You’re fed porti ons of the overall re al estate investing\nstrategies but neve r the entire deal.\nWhy keep some of this information from you? Th e real estate expert believes that if they\ngive you everything you need to know to be succe ssful, they can’t get another dime out of you\n21 for books, courses, seminars, or coaching. So they ’re constantly holding a little back to give you\nnext time in the next product.\nThat is NOT what all real estate experts do. Ma ny real estate expert s work hard to give\nyou everything you need to know to be successful. They simply work at presenting their information in different ways, since some people prefer courses and manuals, while other people\nneed seminars and coaching.\nHowever, be aware that some real estate e xperts will hold back just enough to keep you\ncoming back for more. If you find that the expert you’re dealing with is doing this to you, get off\nof that treadmill and find a better expert. It’s very, very important that you do research on whatever expert with whom you decide to work. There are some great real estate experts who\ngive you more for your money. There are also ex perts who are only inte rested in how much\nmoney they can suck out of you. A good source for information is the Internet. Check a lot of\ndifferent sources to get reviews of  various real estate experts.\nIMPORTANT NOTE:  You may see real estate “w orkshops” advertised in your\narea – “for free”. In many instances, th ese workshops are designed to get the\nattendee excited about re al estate – and sell a $3,000 to $5,000 “advanced”\nseminar or course. I attended a 3-hour real  estate workshop last month as research\nfor this book, and while the speaker was pl easant, his entire speech was light on\ninformation – and heavy on sales pitch. At the end of his talk, he promoted an\nadvanced seminar for $3,000. Later on, in doing some research on the Internet, I\nread negative feedback and comments c oncerning this well-known expert’s\nsystem. However, 15 to 20 people at the workshop signed up. So be careful when\nattending these supposedly “free” events.\n7 Myths About Real Estate Investing That Are\nCosting You Tens Of Thousands Of Dollars\nWritten by Alex Nghiem\nDid you know real estate investing has cr eated more millionaires that ALL other\nindustries combined? The question, then, is why are more people not  invested in real estate?\nEven with the increased awarene ss in real estate investing, more  people are still familiar with\nother forms of investing such as stocks and mutual  funds.  In this article, I will discuss 7 myths\nthat about real estate inves ting that are costing you tens of thousands (maybe hundreds of\nthousands of dollars). These myths persist beca use most people invest in real estate using\nconventional financing, which often requires 5% or more as a down payment. Assuming that\n$150,000 is average price of a house in your area (i n most cities, it's significantly more than\nthat), you would need $7,500 as a down payment (a nd this doesn't even include other fees such\nas closing costs). The purpose of this article is to share techniques of  creative real estate\ninvesting that debunk these common my ths about real estate investing.\n22 Myth #1:\nTo create wealth, you have to in vest in stocks and mutual funds.\nFact:  Real estate investing has created more m illionaires than ALL other industries combined\nincluding Internet marketing, stock investing and mutual fund investing. In fact, according to the\nCEO of FNMA (Federal National Mortgage Associ ation), in the hottest bull market in history,\nmore people ended up creating wealth through home  ownership than through stock ownership.\nMyth #2:\nReal estate investing requires a lot of money.\nFact:  Once you learn how to buy undervalued propertie s, you can find all types of people who\nwill lend you their cash. You can find these people at your local real estate investor association or by contacting us. Additionally, you can use an option (typically $10 to $100 for the option\nfee) to control the property and not even need to raise any capital.\nMyth #3:\nReal estate investing requires good credit.\nFact:  This is related to Myth #1. Again, once you learn how to find undervalued properties, you\ncan find all types of people w ho will lend you their credit, especially if the property has\nsignificant equity. Additionally, you can also use an option to control the property and this\ntechnique doesn't require that you have good credit.\nMyth #4:\nReal estate investing requires you to do major rehabs in dangerous neighborhoods.\nFact:  While you can indeed make good money doing rehabbing, you can make even more\nmoney working with \"pretty houses\", houses in suburban areas that n eed little renovation. In\nactuality, you can make $20,000 or more per $100,000 of  property (thus, in a high-priced market\nsuch as Florida, the average profit would be $40,000 or more per property).\nMyth #4:\nReal estate investing requires dea ling with tenants, repairs or house\npayments.\nFact:  Again, while you can do that, you can also make  money in real esta te investing without\never having to deal with tenants, repairs or house payments through the use of options. One of\nour clients recently made $9,800 in 4 days on his last option deal.\n23 Myth #5:\nYou can only make money in hot markets.\nFact:  You may believe that you can only make mone y by investing in hot markets such as Las\nVegas and Florida. The reality is that once you learn how to buy undervalued properties, you can\nmake money regardless of what the local or national market is doing.\nMyth #6:\nYou have to take huge risks when investing in real estate.\nFact:  You actually have more control when buyi ng real estate than when you buy stocks and\nbonds. You can determine the valu e of the house by using the multiple listing service (MLS) and\ncommercial databases and as long as you can  buy the properties under value, you have a\nsignificant safety margin.\nThese myths about real estate investing ar e probably preventing you from real estate\ninvesting and therefore costing you tens of thousands of dollars . By using options and other\nforms of creative real estate investing, you can overcome these myths and make money in real estate investing without dealing wi th tenants, repairs and holding co sts or needing a lot of cash or\ngood credit.\nAbout the author:\nTo get a free real estate course  on how you can make $10,000 in 90 days...\nwithout dealing with tenants, repairs and holding costs, visit\nhttp://www.wealthau topilot.com/course\nInternet Marketing\nThe Internet has been a blessing for many pe ople who had the dream of starting their own\nhome-based businesses but had been held b ack by high costs, poor location, or limited\nopportunities. Today, the Internet  has given people the opport unity to set up home-based\nbusinesses from their “home office” (or even the kitchen table)and create a full-time income.\nYanik Silver, for example, started his Internet business from a small ta ble in the corner of\nhis living room and has now become an internati onally respected Internet  marketing expert who\npulls in millions of dollars for his information and coaching. Others, who simply want to supplement their current income, are able to sp end just 30 to 45 minutes a day on their home\ncomputer and create $1,000 to $2,500 a month or mo re in extra income. With the low-cost of\nentry, software that can create and run an entire website on autopilot, and a wide variety of order\nprocessing options, virtually anyone with an id ea can start their own bus iness on the Internet.\n24 Internet Marketing Secret #1:\nSell What People Are Buying!\nThis is an obvious secret, right? Unfortunatel y, many beginning Internet marketers have their\nown ideas of what they want to sell. So they spend their hard-earned m oney creating an Internet\nbusiness with all of the bells-and-whistles and en d up with nothing to show for it, other than a\nwell-designed website.\nTo create a solid Internet business, you need to  do a lot of research first and find out what\nthe market you’re going to target wants to buy or is already buying. To see an example of this,\nlet’s take a look at the huge di et and weight-loss i ndustry. Someone interested in dieting and\nweight-loss is NOT going to stop at buying one book, course, tape, or  coaching program. In fact,\npeople who are serious about losi ng weight often end up buying a ll sorts of books on the subject,\nspend money with Jenny Craig and Weight Wa tchers, sign up for memberships at 24-Hour\nFitness and Bally's, and buy diet patches and pills and all sorts of exciting new exercise gadgets.\nIn any market, a buyer is a buyer is  a buyer. If you were going to enter the weight loss industry,\nI’d recommend that you sell something that pe ople are ALREADY BUYING rather than come\nup with something new and untested. People will  always buy THE NEXT BIG diet plan, even\nthough the weight loss industry is cr ammed with thousands of diet pl ans. So sticking to selling\nwhat people are currently buying give s you a better chance for success.\nTo find out what people are buyi ng (or are interested  in) in any particular niche market,\nyou can use services like Wordtrack er (wordtracker.com) that give  you the ability to see exactly\nwhat search terms (keywords) people are using in the major search engines. Then, with this\ninformation, you can continue your research into niche markets,  find out what people are buying,\nand create or find similar products to  promote to that target market.\nRemember: In any business, you want to FIND YOUR MARKET FIRST and get to\nknow them incredibly well. It helps if YOU ar e a buyer in the market you’ll be targeting. For\nexample, if you run a carpet clean ing business, it makes more se nse to sell information products\nto carpet cleaners than it does to people who own pet shops. You know the lingo, the frustrations,\nand the problems of carpet cleaners.  You’ll have a better idea of what type of information carpet\ncleaners want to buy. If you don’t know your market, do some rese arch and find out all you can\nabout them. Read the magazines they read. Go to their trade shows and conventions. Talk to\npeople in that market. Read the books they’ve read. Do whatever it takes to fully understand your\nmarket.\nOnce you know the market inside and out, you should know two important pieces of\ninformation. First, you should know what they ’re already buying. Sec ond, you should know the\nmain problems and frustrations that your market would be willing to pay to solve. With both of\nthese pieces of information, you should know exactly what your market will buy. Now, all you have to do is either find or create the product and sell it to your market.\nInternet Marketing Secret #2:\nStart creating an email list from day one!\nFrom the moment you launch your new Internet business, your website should have a form\n(either in the website itself or one  that pop-ups separately) that as ks the visitor to give you their\n25 name and email address. You can give them an incentive to sign up, like a free report or a multi-\nday course. Or you can simply ask them to si gn up for your monthly newsletter. Whatever you\ndo, you need to start capturing the names and email addresses of your visitors.\nHere’s why:\nonly a small percentage of the visito rs to your website will be converted\ninto buyers. Without the names and email addresse s of your visitors, you w on’t have any control\nover whether or not these people ever  return to your website. And st atistics show that it can take\nmultiple visits to a website before a prospect buys something. With a list of your visitors, you can email them on a regular basis and get them to come back to your website and purchase your\nproduct.\nOnce you have the names and email addresses of visitors to your website, you can contact\nthem on a regular basis about new products, spec ial discounts and offers, or just give them\nvaluable information that will motivate them to want to visit your website and look around. Keep in touch with your email list and you’ll crea te a strong bond with them. People like doing\nbusiness with other people. People they like. By  connecting with the people on your email list,\nyou increase your chances of getting them to c onvert into buyers. And th e more often they buy,\nthe more often they’ll buy. (It ma y sound like a riddle, but it’s true. If someone gets into the habit\nof buying from you, they’re more likely to purc hase more products from you in the future.)\nInternet Marketing Secret #3:\nViral marketing!\nViral marketing is a tremendous tool on the In ternet that can pull in money for you, 24-hours a\nday, 365 days a year, non-stop. Basica lly, “viral” marketing is any ty pe of marketing that spreads\nfrom person to person automatically-- kind of like a flu virus spreads from person to person.\nAnother form of viral marketing is word -of-mouth advertising. If a movie gets good\n“buzz” (a lot of people talking positively about it), that movie will normally have long lines\noutside and make millions of dollars. A restaura nt that gets good “buzz” will be booked solid\nwith reservations for weeks.\nOnline, viral marketing is more powerful b ecause anyone with an email account has the\nability to tell people all over the world about a particular prod uct, service, or company.\nOne of the most popular forms of viral ma rketing are viral e-books. A viral e-book is\nmeant to be given away free, with full rights to  anyone who downloads it to also give it away\nfree. The purpose of giving away the free e-book is simple: Inside the e-book are links back to\nthe company and their products. If the e-book pr ovides great information, there’s a very high\nlikelihood that the e-book will be passed around thousands of times. And since everyone who\ndownloads the e-book also has the right to give  it away, one free e-book can very quickly get\ninto the hands of huge numbers of people. Best of  all, there’s no shelf life for these viral e-books.\nOnce you’ve given the e-book away free, it’s  virtually impossible to stop it from\nspreading. Viral e-books soon become bonuses for other people’s products and services. They’re\ngiven away as bonuses for signing up for an onl ine newsletter. They’re uploaded to free e-book\n26 sites. They’re compiled with othe r e-books into larger packages a nd either given away or sold.\nThey’re duplicated again and again for a vari ety of purposes and end up living “forever”.\nThe amazing thing about viral e-books is that  they can produce a tremendous amount of\ntraffic and sales with no additional effort on your  part. Once you put the viral e-book together\nand start giving it away, it can soon spread on its own. It can soon become a 100%, fully\nautomated money-making machine.\nSome smart marketers have even used this  viral marketing met hod without owning their\nown products. Instead, they’ll sign up for free aff iliate programs and put their affiliate links\nthroughout the e-book. This method is ingenious, b ecause not only is the marketing free (since\nother people are spreading it around the Internet for you), but the marketer gets affiliate checks\nfrom multiple companies and has no products, no inventory, no fulfillment, and no customer service.\nADVANCED INTERNET MARKETING SECRET:\nIf you create your own viral e-book to give aw ay, make sure to include links that YOU\nCONTROL. For example, in the pa st marketers have included affilia te links inside their e-books.\nUnfortunately, some of these companies change their affiliate software, making your affiliate\nlinks dead; they stop offering an affiliate program,  they stop offering that particular product, or\nthey go out of business entirely. So your link continues to get “clicks ” but it stops making you\nmoney. The secret is to include  links that you control. For ex ample, if you want to put your\naffiliate link for an autoresponder service in you r viral e-book, it’s smarter to create a page on\nyour current website that then re-directs a pe rson to your affiliate link for the autoresponder\nservice. A sample link might look something lik e this: www.website.com/autoresponder. Then, if\nsomething happens with the affiliate program, yo u can sign up as an affiliate for a different\nautoresponder service and simply change where your prospects are re-directed to when they click\non the link in your e-book. This way your links are always working for you, no matter what\nhappens with various companies. (Some marketers realized this too late, and their viral e-books\nare being duplicated and given aw ay every day with dead links that make them no money. Make\nsure not to make this same mistake!\nInternet Marketing Secret #4:\nLet other people do your selling for you.\nOne of the most powerful marketing tools on the Inte rnet is an affiliate program. Basically, as an\nInternet business owner, an affiliate program gives other people the ability to promote your\nwebsite and receive a commission for any sales generated by customers they referred to you.\nThey advertise your website (through their spec ially-coded affiliate li nk) and when someone\nvisits your website through their lin k and buys a product, they get paid  a percentage of that sale.\nThe late Corey Rudl, founder of the Internet Marketing Center, created millions of dollars\nin sales with his affiliate program. At the time I’m writing this, his company has over 70,000\naffiliates (myself included) promoting his products and services, generating $1,876,053.00 just\nLAST YEAR ALONE! Corey’s affiliate program is  so popular because he creates and sells high-\nquality products and services for Internet  business owners. For example, his course, Insider\n27 Secrets to Marketing Your Business Online , is widely recognized as a blueprint for starting and\nrunning a successful Internet business.\nTo see what a successful affiliate progra m looks like you can sign up for The Internet\nMarketing Center’s affiliate pr ogram absolutely free. Once yo u’ve signed up, which takes less\nthan 2 minutes, you can log into their affiliate center, check out their system, and see how they work with affiliates so both make money.\nThe Internet Marketing Center  is a great place to begin your affiliate marketing\nadventure.  They advertise that earning affiliate commissions is 100 times easier\nthan running your own business and they ar en’t kidding.  Some of the advantages\ninclude:\n• Immediate profit with zero risk.  There’s never any cost to you.\n• No hassles of product development, ad  writing, order processing, shipping,\nrefunds, and customer service. They do a ll that. All you do is drive visitors to\ntheir site.\n• You don’t have to spend a dime to develop, produce, or warehouse products. The\nowner of the Internet Mark eting Center invested years and hundreds of thousands\nof dollars producing cutting edge books, course s, newsletters, and software so that\nyou don’t have to.\n• Earn money 24 hours every day, even while  you’re sleeping or enjoying yourself\non vacation. The website sells for you, non-stop.\n• Make profits from $65 to $200 per sale!\n• Generate profits from other affiliates who you refer to the affiliate program.\nSign up FREE at www.imcprofits.com\nAnother Internet marketer, David LeDoux, ha s made over $1 million dollars online with\nthe help of over 4,200 affiliates. He’s using The Internet Marketing Center’s software,\nAssocTrac, to work with affiliates and track their sales and commissions. Instead of doing 100%\nof the selling himself, David is  letting thousands of people al l around the world spend their own\ntime, money, and energy advert ising his products and services.\nThe biggest benefit to having an  affiliate program is that it ’s free advertising. It’s like\nhaving a huge commission-only sales force. Y ou can have hundreds of thousands of people\nselling your products (like Amazon.com has) and they ONLY get paid when they make a sale.\nWith an affiliate program, links to your website  can be on thousands of websites and mailed to\nmillions of people on opt-in email lists, and it costs you nothing! Then when someone comes to\nyour website and buys, you simply give the affiliate  that referred the cust omer a portion of the\nsale, from 5% to 75%. Of course, the more mo ney you give your affiliates per sale, the more\naffiliates you’ll have promoting your products and services.\nCurrently, I have 2 affiliate programs. I have  a website for my Millionaire-In-Training\nCoaching Program, which pays each affiliate $25 per month for every sale they make. I also have\nan affiliate program for a downloadable e-book I sell called “The Ultimat e Million Dollar Idea\nGenerator”. I sell that product for $48 and my affiliates get to keep 50% of each sale.\n28 Both programs are making my affiliates m oney. The affiliate program for my “Ultimate\nMillion-Dollar Idea Generator” is popular and does very well, but it only pays a one-time\ncommission. The affiliate program for my Millionaire-In-Training Coaching Program is much more popular with affiliates, because it pays ou t $25 per member, every month, for as long as\nthat member stays with the program. Here’s how the numbers work out:\nNumber of Members  Monthl y Income  Annual Income\n10    $250    $3,000   50    $1,250.00   $15,000   100    $2,500.00   $30,000.00   200    $5,000.00   $60,000.00   500    $12,500.00   $150,000.00\nAs you can imagine, people are very excited about becoming affiliates for the\nMillionaire-In-Training Coachi ng Program. However, while anyone  can sign up as an affiliate\nfor my Ultimate Million-Dollar Idea Generator, th e Millionaire-In-Training Affiliate Program is\na “closed” affiliate program. That means that it’s only open to people who are members of the Millionaire-In-Training Coaching Program. My honest opinion is that  if you’re going to promote\na monthly program like this, you really get to know what it’s all about and ge t all of the benefits\nof it. However, the great thing is that since the monthly investment is only $97 a month, it only\ntakes 4 referrals to cover the enti re cost of the monthly service.\nIf you’d like to join and make money prom oting the Millionaire-In-Training Coaching\nProgram, go online right now to:\nwww.millionaireintraining.com\nIf you’d like to sign up as an affiliate of my  Ultimate Million Dollar Idea Generator, you\ncan sign up free, instantly, by going to:\nwww.inforiches.com/affiliate.htm\nIf you’re selling anything online, I highly recommend that you look into setting up your\nvery own affiliate program.

I really like this company, because it\nseems to have been built for the beginner-- the “Internet newbie”-- to help him or\nher get a fast, easy start with a system that really works. While I haven’t used this\ncompany myself (I had already built ma ny websites before finding them), I’ve\nonly heard good things about them and, from  what I’ve been to ld, their customer\nservice is just amazing. But don’t take my word for it. Check them out for\nyourself, they’re at:\nwww.iSellWebsites.com\nSuper Affiliate Secrets\nAs explained in the previous section, affilia te programs give you the ability to promote a\ncompany’s website, products, and services a nd receive a commission from any sales made\nthrough your efforts. For the beginn ing Internet marketer, this can be one of the easiest ways to\nstart creating real profits on th e net. Because you’re promoting another company’s website, you\nhave none of the normal hassles and headaches  of a regular online business. You have no\nproducts to stock or ship, no employees, no office space, no customer service issues, no technical\nissues, no worry about servers or bandwidth, and you never have to proce ss or fulfill a single\norder. You simply refer other people to the company’s website and when one of the people you\n31 refer buys, you get paid. However, affiliate progr ams are NOT just for beginners. In fact, some\nof the world’s top Internet marketing experts use affiliate programs as extra income streams. And many joint ventures are run through affiliate software.\nOver the years I’ve been on th e Internet, I’ve promoted va rious products and services\nthrough affiliate programs. Currently, I probabl y get from 5 to 10 checks each month from a\nvariety of affiliate programs, including a website  hosting company, an autoresponder service, an\nonline bookstore, a membership site, and a bake d goods company. Most of my marketing efforts\nare on autopilot, so I rarely spend much time promoting these affiliate programs but the checks continue to roll in each month like clockwork.\nAs an affiliate, you can promote virtually an y type of product or service, from both\nsmall websites, as well as major corporate websites, including:\nTarget    Home Depot   Yahoo.com Tommy Hilfiger  eBay.com   Quicken Loans Marriott Hotels  Barnes & Noble  Home Shopping Network\nIBM    Best Buy   Staples Mrs Fields   ShopNBC   Avon Apple Computers  1-800-Flow ers   American Express\nLand’s End   Macy’s   Cingular Wireless NetFlix   Office Depot   Delta Airlines\nOmaha Steaks   Disney    PetSmart Enterprise Rent-a-Car  Foot Locker   Sharper Image The Franklin Mint  Sony Music   Time/Life Tupperware   Hallmark   H&R Block\nZales    Western Union  ...and thousands more!\nWhile many people are making a nice part-time income with affiliate programs, other\npeople have taken the concept to the next level. Rosalind Gardner is a perfect example. Rosalind\nused to be an air traffic contro ller, but she hated her high-stress job. When the Internet started to\nblossom and grow, she decided to go online a nd trade seeds with other gardeners from around\nthe world. During her time online, she decided to  try online dating and s oon discovered that the\nmatchmaking sites had affiliate programs. The re st is history. Rosalind started to promote the\naffiliate program for the matchmaking website and the money started to pour in. During one\nyear, she made $436,797.00 just by promoting other companies’ affiliate programs. She quickly quit her 20-year job as an air traffic controller and is now making money full-time with affiliate\nprograms and her own products. In fact, you can ch eck out Rosalind’s affi liate success story by\ngoing to:\nwww.superaffiliateprofits.com\nPeople, like Rosalind, who create a full-time income with affiliate programs are known as\n“Super Affiliates”. Many super affiliates ma ke up to $100,000 to $1 million dollars or more\nevery year with affiliate programs. For example, here’s a direct quote from  eBay.com’s website,\ntalking about their top affiliates:\n32 “Several eBay affiliates earn over $100,000 every month – well over $1,000,000\neach year! Our top 100 affiliates average nearly $25,000 each month.”\nAffiliate Marketing Secret #1:\nBuild a Website to Build a List.\nOne of the key secrets affiliate marketers all understand is the importance of a list of prospects\nand customers. (In fact, just for your informati on, most marketers would agree that their mailing\nlist is the #1 asset their busine ss has. You can always replace co mputers and furniture cheaply.\nYou can create new products quickly and with out much effort. But creating a mailing list of\nhigh-quality buyers can be very time-consuming and expensive. Plus, it’s the only asset in your\nbusiness that can produce money for you on a regular basis.)\nWhile many companies with affiliate program s suggest that you don’t need a website to\npromote their products or services, it’s highly re commended that you create  a website to feature\nthe affiliate products on, so that you can create a mailing list. The reason to create a mailing list\nis simple. First, many of the visito rs to your website won’t buy the 1\nst time. So you’ll need to\ncontact them multiple times (at least once a mont h). Second, you want to build a bond with your\ncustomers. If you’re able to write a monthly ne wsletter, display your personality through it, and\nsend it to your list, you’ll find two things happen. #1: Some pe ople will NOT like you and they’ll\ndrop off of your list. Don’t worry. That’s a GREAT thing. You can’t please everyone (that’s a\ngood LIFE LESSON), so you shouldn’t waste y our valuable time and energy trying. Not\neveryone is meant to like everyone else. So le t those people who don’t c onnect with you drop off\nyour list. However... #2: Other people will L OVE you and buy affiliate products based on your\nrecommendation alone. Anytime you find a new product or service that you know will be\nbeneficial to the people on your mailing list, you can easily send them all a message and create\nextra affiliate sales.\nOne of the easiest ways to capture, manage, and email your growing mailing lists is with\nan autoresponder. Aweber offers one of the t op autoresponders on the In ternet, used by a wide\nvariety of Internet marketing experts as well as myself. It’s incredibly low-cost for the service\nyou get but a valuable tool for any Internet website you’re thi nking about designing. If you ever\nneed an autoresponder service,  I highly recommend Aweber. You can visit them online and\ncheck them out at:\nwww.awebercash.com\nNOTE:  If you’d like to promote Aw eber’s autoresponder service, you can also sign up for their\n100% FREE Affiliate Program. It’s on their we bsite at www.awebercash.com. Because they\ncharge a monthly fee for their autoresponder service, you get paid monthly for every new\naccount that you refer to them. It’s  a great service – and a great way to make a passive monthly\nincome.\nAffiliate Marketing Secret #2:\nAsk for higher percentage commissions.\nAs you start making more money with affiliate progr ams, you’ll have more leverage to negotiate\nyour commissions. For example, Company A might give every affiliate a 35% commission on all\n33 referred sales. However, if you generate a large number of sales for Company A, you can contact\ntheir affiliate support person and ask for an in creased commission rate, possibly 50%. If you\nreally are producing consistent sales, it’ s likely you’ll get an increased commission.\nMany affiliates could easily make an extra 10% to 20% in commissions, but they miss\nout on this extra money because they’re simply afra id to ask or don’t even realize that they CAN\nask. The worst thing that can ha ppen if you ask is that you’ll be  turned down. However, you may\nalso get exactly what you want, the increased commission, and that has the potential to increase\nyour monthly commissions and put more cas h into your bank account. So once you get\nestablished and start generating significant sales, start asking for increased commissions.\nAffiliate Marketing Secret #3:\nDo Tele-Seminars.\nRecently, I interviewed affiliate expert Russell Br unson for my Affiliate Wealth System course.\nRussell is a master when it comes to making mone y with affiliate programs and he revealed a\ntechnique during our conversation that was amazing.\nHere’s how it works:\nRussell finds an affiliate program for a hot product in which his\nlist of prospects and clients w ould be interested. He contacts the creator of the product and\ninvites him or her to do a LIVE telephone semina r (also known as a tele-seminar) at a certain\ntime during the week. Once this is set up, Russell produces a one-page website (or a page on one\nof his already existing websites) a nd sends an email out to his enti re email list, inviting them to\nthe live tele-seminar-- FREE! All they have to do is go to the Registration Page, sign up, and\nthey’ll get full details about the tele-seminar  emailed back to them. (Russell uses an\nautoresponder service to take their info and automatically em ail them back the tele-seminar call-\nin date, time, and phone number.)\nRussell already has a low-cost tele-seminar company that he works with that can handle\n100’s of callers, all calling in at the same time, to listen to Russell and his special guest. At the\nscheduled time, Russell starts the tele-conference (often with 100’ s of people listening in from\nall over the world) and interv iews the expert for an hour.\nAt the end of the hour, Russell asks the expert  about the product they have for sale. The\nexpert explains it completely and Russell tells his callers that if th ey want to buy it, they need to\ngo to a special website address (which is his affi liate link). He gives them the website address a\nfew times during the last few minutes of the tele-seminar and then finishes up.\nRussell told me that he averages about $5,000 to $8,000 in affiliate sales per 60-minute\ntele-seminar! And because he reco rds these tele-seminars, he can re-run them at anytime; each\ntime he runs them, he makes another $4,000 to $5,000 (and this time, he’s not even there!).\nRussell has used this trick multiple times a nd every time he does it, it creates another\ntidal wave of income for him. Instead of simply adding a link to his website or emailing it to his\nentire list, he creates an “event”  and then “sells” his listeners dur ing the call, closing the sale at\nthe end. Because this method works so well, Russ ell has been able to create huge affiliate\ncommission checks every month. It’s trul y an incredible money-making secret!\n34 Affiliate Marketing Secret #4:\nViral Marketing.\nWhile I mentioned viral marketing before in th e section on Internet ma rketing, it’s such an\nimportant marketing concept, I want ed to re-visit it in this sec tion as well. As you know from my\nprevious writing on this marketi ng method, viral marketing is any t ype of marketing that spreads\nfrom person to person like a virus.\nFor example, Blue Mountain Cards is a website that gives visitors the ability to send free\ne-cards to friends and family. It started off small at first, with just a few people sending e-cards\nto one another. However, each person who recei ved an e-card saw a link to Blue Mountain’s\nwebsite, so if they chose to, they could send a card to someone else. Soon, Blue Mountain was\ngrowing by leaps and bounds. As mo re people received cards, more people started sending cards.\nMore servers were added, traffic reached an al l-time high (almost 9 million users A MONTH!),\nand it soon became the 18\nth most visited website on the In ternet! Then, it was bought-- lock,\nstock, and barrel-- for $780 MILLION DOLLARS! That’s the power of viral marketing.\nHere’s another example of viral marketing. A nd this will give you an idea of how you\ncan use it to make a lot of money with affiliate  programs. A friend of mine created an Internet\nmarketing e-book entitled The Traffi c Toolchest. It shows Internet  marketers dozens of free and\nlow-cost ways to drive traffic to their web bus inesses. Inside the e-book, alongside the valuable\ntraffic techniques, are his affiliate links for pr oducts and services he recommends. Currently, he’s\ngiving his entire e-book free of charge AND letting anyone and everyone also give it away free.\nWhy? Because whenever people read his e- book, they normally end up buying one of the\nproducts or services he recomme nds inside. So naturally he wants his e-book to be downloaded\nand given away thousands of times. As more pe ople download it and give it away free, it gets\ninto the hands of more people who also have the ability to give it to others. And, like a virus, his\ne-book can spread to tens of thousands, even hundreds of thousands of  people all around the\nworld. (If you’d like to download his free e- book to see how he’s doing this, you can go to\nwww.thetraffictoolchest.com )\nThis method of marketing can be as simple or  complex as you want it to be. For example,\nyou can write a short “report” (2 to 5 pages) on a specific topic and includ e a few affiliate links\nthroughout it. Then, you can give it away free, either on your ow n website or through some of\nthe many, many free e-book websites and directorie s on the Internet. (Use Google.com to find\nthese directories and sites). I suggest publishing your report as  a PDF file, because people on\nboth Apple computers and PC’s can download it and everyone can get the free Adobe Acrobat\nReader to view your PDF report. (For information on publishing using PDF, go to: www.adobe.com  and look for information on Adobe Acrobat.\nYou can also create (or hire someone to cr eate for you) an e-book (50 to 200 pages) that\nfeatures many, many of your affiliate links thro ughout it. One word of caution: Do NOT junk up\nyour report or e-book with affiliate links. The BEST affiliate links are featured as a\nrecommended source, within the context of your in formation. Large half-page or full-page ads or\nbanners inside a report or e-book are seen very quickly as “ads” and not as helpful\nrecommendations.\n35 Affiliate Marketing Secret #5:\nHIDE URL’s behind new domains.\nHere’s a simple trick that will help you save  your affiliate commissions. When you become an\naffiliate for a company, you’re often given a very  long, coded affiliate link for you to promote.\nFor example, if you’re promoting something lik e my Millionaire-In-Training Coaching Program,\nyour affiliate link will look like this: http://www.millionaireint raining.com/?id=toolchest\nThat’s not too bad. I’ve actually seen  affiliate links that look like this:\nhttp://www.metareward.com/mr/P age?p=ez45&ci=30045&pubci=41666&off\nerId=1914&sn=rv&showmrpx=F&nord=T&c=RV_1500STOREGC&wsh0=1155&px1=webspon1500Kmart&ptr _id=33111&sid2=33111&sion=on\nLet’s take this link as an example:   http://www.millionaireintra ining.com/?id=toolchest.\nIt’s very easy for someone to shorten the li nk down to just millionaireintraining.com, go\nto the website and, if they buy, the affiliate (id=toolchest) is out of their commission.\nHere’s how you can fix that problem:  Instead of promoting your affiliate link, you can\ngo to any domain name registration compa ny (I recommend www.thedomaincenter.com) and\nregister a new domain name for under $10 bucks . Then, you can have your new domain forward\nvisitors to your affiliate link. For example, instead of promoting...\nhttp://www.millionaireintraining.com/?id=toolchest\n...you could register a domain like...\nwww.soontoberich.com\nThen, you simply advertise the shorter dom ain and when people visit it, they’re\nautomatically re-directed to your  affiliate link. Most domain regi stration companies even let you\nset up the forwarding service so that your visitors won’t know th ey’ve been forwarded to an\naffiliate link.\nThis is a great technique if you plan to prom ote your affiliate links in any offline media,\nlike TV, radio, newspapers, or magazines. It’s also an effective marketing method for email,\nbusiness cards, and promoting your affiliate  links through word-of-mouth advertising.\n36 Affiliate Business Blueprint\nRecently, Rosalind Gardner  (www.superaffiliateprofits.com) sat down\nwith Internet marketing master, Jim Edwards , to create a blueprint... a virtual\n“roadmap”... to create a non-stop stream of cash, using only affiliate programs.\nTheir blueprint package is great, because Part #1 is a 2 ½ hour tele-seminar\nrecording and transcript  – where they reveal everything about making real\nwealth with affiliate programs.

That’s wh ere reprint rights come in. Reprint rights are simply the rights\nto reprint a product, ofte n along with the sales letter to sell it. Because of the profit potential of\ninformation products, you may end up paying $1,000 to $10,000 for the reprint rights to one or\nmultiple products you can sell. Some of thes e include, but are not limited to, audio CD’s,\nsoftware, books, courses, manuals, DVD’s, e-books, and CD-ROMs. Another type of rights is\n“resell rights”. With resell rights,  you simply have the right to resell a product and keep a large\nportion of each sale. However, orders may have to be fulfilled through the company that sold you the resell rights.\n“Master Reprint Rights” are rare and, when offered, can be very expensive. Basically,\nMaster Reprint Rights give you the ability to no t only reprint and sell a product, but to also\nSELL the rights to that product to  others. For example, with Reprint Rights for a book, you can\nprint and sell as many copies of that book as  you wish. However, you cannot give or sell the\nrights to reprint the book to anyone else. With Ma ster Reprint Rights, you have both the rights to\nreprint the book, as we ll as sell the reprint righ ts to others, giving them the rights to reprint and\nsell the book as they please. (In this example, your customers become reprint right owners only,\nso they can reprint the book, but not  sell the reprint rights  to anyone else.) Ma ster reprint rights\nare extremely valuable, because while reprint righ ts for a particular product can easily sell for\n$1,000 to $2,500, master reprint rights can sell  for $5,000 to $10,000 or more. I know of one\nmarketer who spent $20,000 for the Master Rights to  one product. It worked out because he sold\nthe reprint rights to 1,000 other people for $1,000 each, generating $1 million in sales.\nMichael Kimble of Group M Marketing in Austi n, Texas, quit his job as a very successful\nsalesman to make money with reprint rights. Today, his comp any is easily one of the top\nproviders of reprint and resell rights. Many of his re print rights packages come complete with\nmultiple products, ready-to-go sales materials, and in some instances, even fully automated marketing websites. Michael is so well respected that when I visited his offices a few years ago,\nhe told me that he would be handling the re print rights of marketing expert, Dan Kennedy.\nReprint Right Secret #1:\nKnow The History of The Repr int Rights You’re Buying.\nOne of the challenges with purchas ing reprint rights is that ofte n the products are worn-out and\noversold. In some instances, selling the reprint rights for a product is a marketer’s last-ditch\nattempt to squeeze a few more bucks out of a product before it dies completely. Often, sales\nletters promoting reprint rights for worn-out products talk about the millions made with a particular product. There are testimonials from  happy users and proof that the product was sold\nto thousands. While that information creates pr oof in the potential repr int rights buyer’s mind\nthat this is a good investment, it should also be seen as a poten tial warning sign. After all, it’s\ncompletely possible that the sales of this product  have slowed down so mu ch that the promoter\ndecided to stop selling it and be lieves he can create one last wi ndfall of cash by selling the rights\nfor it to others. Unfortunately, if that’s the ca se, the buyers of the reprint rights might find it\ndifficult or impossible to sell this  product. Before you invest in  any high-priced reprint right\noffer, you should have a very clear plan for pr omoting it, including who your target market is\n41 and how you’ll promote this product to them. If  you do that, you should be able to recoup your\ncosts and make a profit, even if a product has b een sold very successfully before the rights were\nmade available.\nReprint Right Secret #2:\nWhen you buy reprint rights to a product you’re not alone.\nSometimes 50, 100, maybe even 1,000 people or more have purchased the reprint rights at the\nsame time. Each reprint right owner has the same marketing materials, same ads, and same product. And, if you’re in a small niche with onl y a handful of magazines to advertise in, you\nmay find yourself running ads next to your comp etition and making the exact same offer.\nHere’s how you can beat your competition:  make changes to the product and the offer\nthat will set yourself apart from your competitors. For example, let’s say that you’re selling an 8\naudio CD program. You can have all 8 CD’s tr anscribed and create a manual. Now, you have a\nbonus item (possibly for a deluxe package) that y our competition does not. You can also write or\nhire a freelance writer to create additional bonus reports on a topic similar to the one featured on\nthe audio CD’s. You can re-name the product and give  it a more attention-grabbing title. You can\nbreak the product into pieces and offer a basic and deluxe package. You can offer payment plans. Offer unrelated bonuses, like a mouse pad, coffee mug, or calculator. You can offer a stronger guarantee, such as personal coaching, a free newsle tter or whatever it take s to separate yourself\nfrom everyone else selling the exact same product.\nYou see, 99.9% of the people who buy reprint righ ts, if they do anything at all, will just\nfollow the system laid out by the company that so ld them the rights. If there aren’t that many\nrights owners, that can work. But selling reprint rights can be so incredibly lucrative, many\ncompanies put no limit to the number of reprint rights they’ll sell for any individual product.\n(One reason for this is that a majority of people who buy reprin t rights for any one product do\nabsolutely nothing with it, so there’s normally little worry about rights owners stumbling over\neach other in the marketplace.) To separate your self from the pack, you need to do things\ncompletely different than the other reprint rights  owners. You may still co ntinue to advertise in\nthe same magazines (in small niche markets, you may have no choice), but you may create your\nown brand-new, eye-catching ads. You may re-wor d the sales letter so it ’s more hard-hitting.\nAnd you may make all of the previous changes I mentioned to pull prospects and profits from\nyour competition.\nReprint Right Secret #3:\nHere’s where the real mone y is in reprint rights?\nSelling them! Yes, if you have th e reprint rights to  a great product, you can make good money\nselling the product to others. However, because “R eprint Rights” are mostly “air”, these offers\ncome with huge profit margins. For example, if I sell you a 200-page course  with 6 audio CD’s, I\nmay charge you $497. However, if I sell you the repr int rights to this product, I’ll probably\ncharge you $3,500 or more. The costs of printing and shipping the course itself might be about\n$50 bucks. The cost of printing and shipping the course WITH Reprint Rights is also probably\nclose to $55 to $60 bucks. In fact, the only extra thing someone might add to a particular course\nwhen you buy reprint rights is a “Quick Start Manual”  with copies of the ads and letters, plus\ninstructions on how to set up a merchant account, how to take orders by phone, and sources for\n42 printing and audio duplication. At the most, that adds another $5 to $10 on top of the cost of\nshipping the course itself. So the reprint right s cost you $3,500 but it cost s the promoter of the\nreprint rights only $60 bucks to print and ship you the entire “Reprint  Rights Package”. (Oh\nyeah, and it costs another 25 cents or so to pr int up a “Reprint Right s Certificate” with your\nname on it.)\nDo you see why people want to se ll reprint rights? If I’m just selling the course itself, I’m\nmaking $447 profit per sale. However, when I start selling the reprint rights to this course, I’m\npocketing a whopping $3,440 PROFIT PER SALE! All of that extra money comes from the\n“rights” that I’m granting you. It’s what marketer s call “air”. It’s not physi cally tangible, but it\nhas a high-perceived value. While there IS money (a lot of it) in sel ling information products,\nyou can make 5 to 10 times that much when you have  the ability to sell re print rights to info-\nproducts to others.\nVending\nVending machines are everywhere. From the Coke or Pepsi vending machines in most\noffice buildings, airports, and malls to the sma ller candy and toy vending machines in your local\ngrocery store, it’s a virtual guarantee that you or  someone in your family has plunked money into\na vending machine. Since running a vending machine business appears to be a relatively hands-\nfree operation, there is a lot of interest in it  from people looking for an easy money-making\nopportunity they can run out of th eir home. Because of that dema nd, a lot of “fly-by-night” scam\nartists have entered the vending business and given it a black eye. While there is money to be\nmade in vending, it’s important to do your resear ch and talk to people in the industry (people\nactually running their own vending businesses) BEFORE you invest on e dime in your own\nmachines.\nVending Secret #1:\nSome companies selling the vending machines\nmake more money than the people buying and servicing them.\nDo you ever wonder why there are so many co mpanies offering you the opportunity to get\ninvolved in the “lucrative” vending machine industr y? Go to business opportunity or franchise\nshows in your area and you’ll see a variety of co mpanies with vending machine equipment to sell\nyou.\nUnfortunately, the truth is that the pers on who makes the most money from vending\nmachines is often the person selling YOU the vendi ng machine. You see, the vending business is\nan easy business to hype up. After all, vending m achines can be placed one time and they can\ndeliver their product and take money non-stop, 24 hours a day. So you can feasibly run a vending\nbusiness in your spare time, spending just a fe w hours a week placing and refilling your vending\nmachines. Plus, profits on the items in your vendi ng machine can be relativ ely high, especially if\nyou buy in bulk or from a reputable wholesaler.\nBecause of the seeming “ease” of the vending business, it’s easy for companies selling\nvending machines to hook people. They show m ountains of quarters and cash. They talk about\n43 how you can increase your income simply by incr easing the number of machines you have. They\ntalk about how you can run this entire business in ju st your spare time and ra rely have to talk to\nanyone. They even tell you it’s an  “all cash” business with a know ing “wink-wink” that suggests\nthat you don’t have to pay taxes on your vending income if you don’t report it.\nWhat ultimately happens is that they se ll you a very low-quality vending machine for a\nvery high price. In many instances, people sp end hundreds, even thousands of dollars, for\nvending machines that quickly break, jam, or can be jimmied open by even the most novice of\ncriminals. They may also explain that you need to purchases all of your  supplies for the vending\nmachines (candy, toys, etc.) directly from them . Again, they generate even more cash from you.\nAnd now it’s in your hands to make the contacts, try to place these machines, and then hope that\nyou’ve picked a popular location. If your vending machines aren’t producing cash, it’s time to\npick them up and move them again. And often you’ ll find that the very best spots are already\ntaken.\nI’m not suggesting that you absolutely cannot  make money with vending. However, what\nI am suggesting is that there are many, many comp anies in this industry giving it a black eye.\nAnd that suggests that you need to do a lot of research and due diligence before sinking even one penny into vending machines.\nVending Secret #2:\nThere are three things you must do before getting  into the vending business: 1. Rese arch, 2. Research, 3. Research.\nTalk to other people in the vending business fi rst. Do research on the vending companies\noffering you equipment and supplies. The Internet has a wealth of information about vending and\nspecific companies selling vending equipment. Y ou’ll soon have all of the information you need\nto make an informed decision on whether or not a vending business is right for you.\nVending Secret #3:\nThe secret to making money in vending\nis having the right product in the right location.\nFor example, waiting rooms and office buildings  are great for many types of vending machines.\nYou have a large captive audien ce every day. However, you may qui ckly discover that the best\nspots are already taken. Often, sm art vending companies quickly ma ke deals with hospitals, car\ndealerships, and local busine sses to supply them with ve nding machines. These vending\nbusinesses are more likely to get these types of  profitable locations, be cause they have an\nestablished track record and can show the location owner do llar amounts and potential profits\nthat they’ll receive. Of ten, it’s hard for the person new to vending to capture key locations.\nHowever, it’s not impossible. But you do need to  do some research in your local area and spend\ntime choosing the right locations  for your vending machines.\nVending Secret #4:\nDo NOT expect to become a “Vending Millionaire”.\nYes, some vending companies promise you riches . They talk about vending machines being\npacked with money and about people making six fi gures a year with only a handful of machines.\n44 They tell you stories of the “vending lifestyle” and how you could quit your job and have your\ntime off to do whatever you please, still spendi ng just a few hours a week checking and filling\nyour vending machines. While an establishe d vending business CAN make good money, do not\nexpect to become the next vending multi-millionaire.  Very few people, if any, get wealthy with a\nhandful of machines. To truly make a good livin g with a vending machine, you need the right\nvending machines in the right locations. And even then, it’s still a business that needs to be\nmanaged and run correctly for it to produce profits. Don’t be f ooled into believing that the\nvending machine business is your  key to overnight wealth.\nVending Secret #5:\nDo NOT get in over your head.\nRefuse to be pressured into buying a ton of mach ines when you’re starting out. Start small, with\none machine, then grow as your profits allow. I’ve heard too many horror stories of people being\ntalked into buying tens of thousands of dollars worth of machines to ge t a “special discount”.\nThen they’re stuck with a lot of machines to pl ace, a monthly financing bill to the company that\nsold them the machines (since this large of a pur chase is usually financed), and no positive cash\nflow. If they’re lucky, the machines  are good quality and they just have to kick it into high gear\nand start placing the machines as soon as possibl e. If they’re not so lucky, they may be stuck\nwith thousands of dollars worth of low-quality  vending machines that will break quickly. The\nmain problem with investing a lot of money when  you’re starting out is th at you’re starting deep\nin a financial hole that you’re going to have to begin filling up quickly with quarters and dollars\nfrom your vending machines. Often, it may take a few weeks to place all of the machines and\neven then, cash flow might be slow. At the sa me time, you’ll be receiving regular monthly bills\nfrom the vending company (or their financing company).\nIf you’re serious about the vending business, my  suggestion is to dip your toe into this\nindustry first before you jump in with both feet. You can always grow from one machine to 10 or\n100. It’s much more difficult to succeed when you have already jumped in with 100 and they’re\nnot making enough money to even pay for themselves.\nNetwork Marketing\nLet’s be honest. The network marketing indus try (also known as multi-level marketing or\n“MLM”) doesn’t have the best reputation. Yes,  there are a handful of multi-billion dollar\ncorporations in this field ( like Amway), but there are also many, many short-lived companies\nthat appear out of thin air and, very quickly, disappear back into thin air, leaving its distributors\nout in the cold.\nMy experiences with network ma rketing opportunities have been pretty dismal. It is hard\nto recruit other people into the solid companies that have been around for years. And the “ground\nfloor” opportunities that no one  has seen before often end up getting shut down by the\ngovernment or grow so fast, they can’t handle  the growth, and they implode. I’ve even seen\nsome network marketing experts get tired of th eir companies and focus on teaching others about\nnetwork marketing (or other businesses),instead of working with an actual network marketing\ncompany.\n45 Can you make real, honest money with a good network marketing company? Even\nthough I’ve been burned over and over again, I believe you can. Of course, finding a good\nnetwork marketing company is like finding a n eedle in a haystack. And the hype about “just\nsigning up a few people and getting rich overnig ht” is crazy. Network marketing, like any home\nbusiness, takes time, money, and energy to make it work. In fact, all of the heavy hitters I know\nhave put in a bunch of time and money to create systems and marketing tools to make their huge\ndown-lines. It didn’t ju st happen like magic.\nOver the years, I’ve discovered some very in teresting “secrets” a bout network marketing\nand if they’ll help you save some se rious money, I’m happy to share them!\nNetwork Marketing Secret #1 :\nMany heavy hitters earn MOST of their money selling training\nmaterials, NOT in promoting their  network marketing opportunity.\nHere’s a secret you may not know. Many “Heavy Hitters” (people in a network marketing\nprogram that normally create large down-lines) ge t a large portion of their income from selling\ntraining tools, marketing materials, or auto-pilot lead-generating systems, NOT from their efforts\nin their network marketing company.\nYes, these heavy hitters have, in most instan ces, created large down-lin es in their network\nmarketing opportunity. However, early on, most h eavy hitters realize that a majority of the\npeople who get involved in any network marketi ng opportunity need help. Most people who join\na network opportunity are only ab le to promote it part-time, a nd many don’t have the marketing\nor sales expertise necessary to create  a large down-line or make many sales.\nThat’s where the heavy hitter comes in. Arme d with books, courses, tapes, coaching, co-\nop advertising programs, turn-key  lead generation websites, tele -seminars, and just about any\nand every product and service needed to promot e a networking opportunity, the heavy hitter\nstarts to turn his down-line in to a virtual money machine.\nVery quickly, checks from training courses, coaching, ad pools, websites, and coaching\ncan eclipse the money the heavy hitter is maki ng from the networking opportunity itself. You\nsee, when the heavy hitter promotes the networ king opportunity or sells the products, he has to\nshare his commissions with the company and his up-line. However, when he’s selling training\ntools or other materials to his down-line, he gets to keep 100% of the profits for himself.\nI’m not saying that it’s wrong for these heavy hi tters to create and sell networking tools\nand courses. But what I want you to understand is that if you fo llow a heavy hitter into an\nopportunity, or get involved because a big name heavy hitter is involve d, you may want to look\nat what else he or she is se lling. You may discover that they ’re using the company to build a\nlarge down-line to which they’re then  able to sell training tools.\n46 Network Marketing Secret #2:\nDo what the heavy hitters do.\nUnderstand that what heavy hitter s do and what they say to do to be successful can be two\ndifferent things. Make sure you’re willing to do what they’re doing if you want to make the\nmoney they’re making.\nQuite a number of years ago, I was at an oppor tunity meeting where a heavy hitter was\npromoting a network marketing deal. I can’t rememb er the opportunity, but I’m pretty sure it’s\nno longer in existence. The guy promoting the op portunity explained how easy it was to make\nmoney. You didn’t have to talk to anyone or meet people face-to-face. All you had to do was\nsend out an audio-tape and you could bu ild a huge down-line just like he did.\nHere’s the problem:\nWhat he was saying and what he was doing were two different\nthings. He claimed you could build  a huge down-line by just mailing out tapes. If that was the\ncase, why would anyone need to fill a large hot el conference room and pitch the opportunity for\na few hours? If it was as easy as mailing out tape s, I’d expect him to be at home, shoving tapes\ninto envelopes, and taking them to the post office.\nThe truth is that most heavy hi tters work very, very hard to  create their down-lines. They\nfill up hotel conference rooms and hold 1-day live seminars to get people involved. They travel\nfrom city to city, all across the country, talking to groups a bout this brand new opportunity.\nThey’re on the phones, day and night, closing pe ople into their opportunity. They’re doing\nnightly conference calls, pitching their opportunity endlessly. Yes, it pays off, but it’s worlds\ndifferent than the “easy” system they sugge st you should use to promote the opportunity.\nI know of one gentleman who has built a $300,0 00 a year income in one opportunity, and\nhe’s done it by sitting at home, closing people by phone, for years and years and years. In fact,\nhe’s chained to the phone, Monday through Saturda y, from 9am to 9pm, taking calls and closing\npeople. While you might think that the income he’s making is phenomenal, let me ask you these questions--\nFirst, would you be willing to sit on the phone, 12 hours a day, Monday through Friday?\nThat’s 72 hours a week. Do you feel comforta ble pitching people your opportunity by phone,\nover and over and over again, for many years, to  build up a six-figure income? Remember, we’re\nnot talking about your first year. We’re talki ng about doing this, non-stop, for 2 to 5 years or\nmore before you create a six-figure income.\nSecond, are you willing to live your life knowing that any day your six-figure income can\ndisappear in a puff of smoke? Imagine putting in  these long hours, maybe even reaching your\ngoal of a six-figure income. But,  like many network marketing co mpanies, let’s say it crashes\nand goes out of business. If you’re lucky, your down-line will stick with  you and you can move\nthem into a new network marketing opportunity . But imagine the feeling of going from $100,000\na year with a company down to $0 instantly! Esp ecially after putting in a ll of those long hours.\nIf you’re serious about making money in netw ork marketing, I’m not  trying to talk you\nout of it. Personally, I’m not a big fan of network marketing opport unities. Throughout my 19\n47 years of searching for wealth-building secret s, I’ve only stumbled onto a handful that I\nconsidered worthy of investing my time and money. However, if you like network marketing\nopportunities, just be aware that the heavy hitters, th e people making the big bucks, are usually\ndoing more than mailing out a few postcards. They ’re traveling all acro ss the country, doing live\ntele-seminars, closing hundreds of people a month by phone, talking to people in person, and\nputting in a lot of time and energy. Don’t expect to duplicate their incomes if you’re not willing\nto duplicate their exact actions.\nNetwork Marketing Secret #3:\nThe “opportunity” is the always the focus, NOT the product.\nIn many cases, the product that the network marke ting company is selling is  usually secondary to\nthe opportunity. Let’s not kid ourselves. Often, network mark eting companies are built as\nmoney-making opportunities first and the product is added as an  afterthought. In fact, if you\nlisten to people promoting some of these networking opportunities, you only hear about the\ncompensation plan and possible income. You rarely  hear about the product, how in-demand it is,\nor how well it’s selling. Even if you do hear something about the product, the opportunity to\npromote it is always the main focus. Rarely is the main focus promoting and selling the product.\nBe very, very careful about getting involve d in a networking opportunity that focuses\nMORE on getting involved in the opportunity than  in selling a product. He re’s why: there are\nonly a finite number of people in  the world. Therefore, there ar e only a finite number of people\nwho will be willing and able to join any networking opportunity. Without strong product sales,\nmost networking companies will implode, becau se recruiting efforts slow down when the\nopportunity hits critical mass.  Then, people who came in late r find it difficult to sign up new\nclients and end up moving to a newer “ground floor” opportunity.\nI can think of one networking company that is a multi-billion dollar corporation and has\nbeen around for years. They’re huge. However, try to sign up other peop le into this company\nwhen just mentioning the name of the company will turn people off. In fact, their name is synonymous with “MLM meetings”. Today, just to get people to attend opportunity meetings for\nthis company, recruiters have to make sure they DO NOT mention the company name. They wait\nto tell them the company’s identity AFTER  they’ve got their audience locked in!\nSo how does this company survive? They do it with sales of products and training\nmaterials to its members and customers of its me mbers. They continue to create new products\nand their huge member base continues to sell thes e products. Yes, there is still some focus on the\nopportunity itself but product sale s are also very, very strong.\nIf you find someone pitching you a networking opportunity where th e product has taken a\nbackseat or it seems overpriced, low quality, or  something just “tacked on” to a networking\nopportunity to make it legal (the y have to sell something or it’ s a pyramid scheme), watch out!\n48 Network Marketing Secret #4:\nMost people don’t get a single commission check\nfrom their network marketing opportunity.\nIt’s true. Most people don’t get even a small commission check from their network marketing\nefforts. And many of the people who do get a chec k don’t make back more than their investment\nin products and training material s. Often, you only hear about the handful of heavy hitters who\nare making six-figures in the company. Rarely do you hear about the thousands upon thousands\nof members making little or no money. However, it’s the one or two success stories advertised in\nall of the company’s ads th at pull people in like crazy.\nWhenever someone brings a network marketi ng opportunity to me, I let him or her know\nI have ONE RULE about looking at new opportu nities. I will ONLY l ook at new opportunities\nIF the person presenting it to me... the pers on who wants me to sign up... has made significant\nmoney in the program. So far, that has stopped about 99.9% of the networking pitches I normally\nget. Most people who contact me about an opportun ity like this have “someone in their up-line”\nwho is making a bunch of money. Or they listened to a heavy hitter on a teleconference who is\nraking in the cash. Rarely, if ever, is the pers on who brings the opportunity to me making any\nsignificant money. I normally tell that person to keep me in mind and once they start making a\nsignificant profit (usually enough to replace th eir income) to come back and present the\nopportunity to me again. So far, I’ve never had someone return to me with his or her success\nstory and re-invite me to join their program.\nThat, to me, says volumes!\nNetwork Marketing Secret #5:\nHeavy hitters get special treatment.\nHeavy Hitters often get extra “perks” or better  placement in a network marketing company as\n“payment” for joining (since they ’ll create large down- lines, bring large down-lines from their\nold program, and can be a BI G NAME to attract others).\nIf you had a new, fledgling network marketing oppor tunity, you’d want a lot of heavy hitters to\njoin your program, right? Once that happens, yo u can start promoting your opportunity, cross\nyour fingers, and hope that some new up-and-coming heavy hitter will appear from the thousands of new recruits into your program. Bu t the chances of that happening are slim.\nA better option would be to go to a current h eavy hitter, someone with a large down-line,\nlots of experience, and an in-d epth knowledge of how  to create big money for their networking\ncompany and offer them a special deal.\nWhat type of special deal? Higher placement. Instead of coming in further down the\ncompany’s payment plan, the heavy hitter might be placed further up the commission structure,\ncloser to the company, so he can instantly benefi t from the work of the down-line that’s already\nin place. The heavy hitter might also get bonuses , be paid to speak at  the company’s annual\nmeetings, and get other perks as well.\n49 Heavy hitters who have proven themselves rare ly have to start from scratch. Normally,\nthey’re a welcome addition to any networki ng opportunity with the company running the\nopportunity often feeling obligated to reward the heavy hitters who join their program.\nRemember, it’s impossible for the networkers on the front lines to know what’s going on in the\nheadquarters. The heavy hitter that joined your pr ogram because “he just loves it so much” might\nhave also joined because he’s ge tting perks that you don’t know about.\nRecommended Resource\nThe Ultimate MLM Bluepr int for Massive Success\nDavid LeDoux  is a true network marketing expe rt.

Fo r a fee, you have the ability to rese ll their line of 1,000’ s of gift items.\nYou can buy catalogs from the company, give th em away, mail them-- whatever, and whenever\nyou make a sale, you pocket a profit from each it em ordered. Then, you simply forward the order\nto the company and they drop ship it to your customers under your label. Simple, right?\nUnfortunately, I discovered what so many ot her people discover. The market for gift\nitems is packed with competitors. Many of the produc ts I tried to sell were figurines, lamps, and\nitems you might see in any of a dozen local gift  stores. There were a lot of great items, but\nnothing so unique that you couldn’t find the exac t same item or something similar just down the\nstreet.\nThe real lure behind these type s of opportunities is th e idea that it’s an  easy, fun business\nthat anyone can do. After all, ever yone buys gifts, right? Whether it’ s for the holidays, birthdays,\nanniversaries, or weddings, the gift market is huge. Plus, the profit margins are decent and you\nnever have to stock and ship any of the produc ts yourself. Simply hand out a few catalogs to\n“friends and family” or your co-workers  take orders, and pocket big profits.\nRarely does that happen. Your friends, fam ily, and co-workers buy their gifts at major\nretailers. Often, you may have a few people take  pity on you and purchase something from your\ncatalog. Maybe someone might even find a few thi ngs they really want. But you can’t run an\nentire business on a handful of customers. Very  quickly, you realize that to make a decent\nincome, you need a lot of orders on a consiste nt basis. Buying and mailing out catalogs to\n51 mailing lists is a very, very expensive propositi on, and you’re competing with thousands of mail\norder companies also selling gifts (not to men tion the 1,000’s of other distributors of the same\nwholesale catalog to which you have the rights). Or, like some , you may decide to set up your\nown gift shop. Fantastic! Now you have overhead like rent, water, electricity, and employees.\nPlus, if you want to open your own shop, you ca n no longer rely on the drop ship method of\ngetting products to your cust omers. You now have to inve st thousands of dollars in\nINVENTORY!\nUgh! I could go on and on, but I think you get the point. Are there pe ople who scrape and\nstruggle and work like crazy and make money w ith these types of opport unities? You bet. But\nI’m convinced from my own experience that most people who join these type  of “gift reselling”\nopportunities never make back  what they’ve invested.\nTurnkey Websites\nTurnkey Website Secret #1:\nYOU pay to sell their products.\nCompanies that sell turnkey we bsites get paid twice, when you buy the turnkey website AND\nwhen your site makes sales (IF the turnkey website makes sales).\nMaking money on the Internet can seem diffic ult or confusing. You need to choose the\nright market, create a product, write compe lling sales copy, design a website, get an online\npayment processor, and then promote the websit e. It’s no wonder that turnkey, ready-to-go\nwebsite opportunities are so popular.\nSome of the most popular “turnkey websites ” deal with either “adult entertainment”\nwebsites or things like gambling, e-bo oks, or diet & nutritional products.\nBasically, you buy a turnkey website from a company. It’s already designed, the copy is\nwritten, the products are stocked, and all you have to  do is promote it. That’s  it. It’s like buying a\n“business-in-a-box”.\nOne of the problems I have with some turnke y website opportunities is  that the websites\nthemselves, while they look incred ible, simply don’t appear to be created to generate actual\nsales. The company, in most instances, is ma king a mint by selling would-be entrepreneurs a\ncomplete, ready-to-go Internet “bus iness”. But often the website really doesn’t sell very well. It’s\ndesigned to look professional, but often, the most successful websites on the Internet have very\nfew graphics and are very heavy on sales copy.\nLet’s look at some logic:\nlet’s say that you have a website that really sells like crazy and\nconverts 25% of its visitors into buyers. What you want now is traffic. In fact, the more traffic\nthe better. Since you know your website is a winn er, let’s say that you set up a free affiliate\nprogram and let anyone and everyone promote your  website. The more people who promote your\nwebsite, the more money you make. And your aff iliates win too, because your website converts\nvisitors into buyers so well, your affiliates are making a killing. Sounds reasonable, right?\n52 Now, let’s look at another example. Let’s ta ke a website that looks  great, but does NOT\nconvert visitors into buyers. If you had a webs ite that was NOT making any sales, it makes no\nsense to offer a free affiliate program, because yo ur affiliates will very qui ckly discover that your\nprogram isn’t generating sales and stop prom oting it immediately. Plus, even if you have\nmillions of affiliates, if your we bsite can’t convert visitors in to buyers, you still won’t make\nmoney.\nWhat some companies do when they have a poorly performing website is to SELL it as a\nturnkey website business for $1,000 to $5,000!\nSeems crazy, right? Well, some of these compan ies reason that if they can’t make money\nfrom the sale of the products on the website , they have to make their money SELLING THE\nWEBSITE ITSELF! So they sell each turnkey we bsite (or worse yet, they sell a block of\nwebsites) to unsuspecting entrepre neurs who want to start an Internet business. The entrepreneur,\nafter spending a lot of time, m oney, and energy promoting the webs ite quickly discovers that the\nwebsite doesn’t work.\nI highly encourage you to research ANY company offering you turnkey website\nopportunities. I’m not suggesting that every comp any offering you a high-dollar turnkey website\nis trying to rip you off. What I am suggesting is that logic sugge sts that most companies with a\nwinning offer would NOT want to sell you their website. So be cautious and perform your due\ndiligence. Check it out BEFORE you invest. Ther e are so many free affiliate programs you can\njoin, it personally doesn’t make sense to me  to pay $1,000 to $5,000 for virtually the same thing.\nTurnkey Website Secret #2:\nThey make MORE MONEY selling MORE SERVICES!\nCompanies that sell turnkey websites make ev en MORE MONEY selling you other advertising,\nautoresponders, and other services for your website.\nGot a turnkey website? That’s just the FIRST STEP!   When a company sells you a turnkey website you automatically need ADVERTISING to\npromote it. So the same company that sold you the website is often the first person at your\ndoorstep (or your email in-box) offering you an a dvertising package to promote your website to\nthe world.\nFor companies selling turnkey websites, it’s  the perfect one-two punch. They can supply\nyou with a business and then sell you the advertis ing to promote it. It’s like a car company\nowning an oil company or gas station. I’m not sa ying that it’s a bad thing-- UNLESS the website\nthey’ve sold you is worthless. Again, be cau tious. Some companies are taking advantage of\npeople who desperately want to make money on th e Internet but aren’t exactly sure of what\nthey’re doing.\n53 Recommended Resource :\nInstead of buying a turnkey website, I highly recommend signing up for free\naffiliate programs and promoting them. One of the reasons I like affiliate programs is that the company offering one  realizes that if you’re not making\nmoney, you won’t be an affiliate for long. So  the website owner does all that he or\nshe can to make sure that a good percentage  of visitors are converting into buyers.\nSince the website owner only makes money when his affiliates make money, there’s added incentive to ensure the affiliates are happy and making money. With\nturnkey websites, since you fork over a la rge pile of cash before you even start\npromoting the website, the company selli ng you the site is already rolling in\nprofits, making them less motivated to make sure you bring in money.\nIf you have an interest in promoting h ealth and beauty products (a huge multi-\nbillion dollar industry), I highly recommend checking out the Joe Bucks Herbal\nAffiliate Program.

When I personally got\ninvolved in this industry in the la te 1990’s, I didn’t re alize just how much money there was to be\nmade. I started out very small. I bought a website  and quickly realized that selling low-cost\nbooks and manuals wasn’t going to make me a m illionaire. After some research, I discovered a\ngentleman by the name of David who was maki ng very good money from a website similar to\nmine. He also sold low-cost books. However, he was also selling somethi ng I wasn’t: advertising\non his website.\nI very quickly started selling advertising on my website and in the first 30 days, I sold\n$11,000 worth of advertising. I was hooked! Over th e next few years, I sold more and more\nInternet advertising, both on my websites as well  as brokering advertisin g for other websites. I\nsold text ads, banner ads, targeted traffic, sear ch engine submission, and paid inclusion services.\nDuring this time, I generated well over $2 million dollars in sales-- all by selling Internet advertising.\nJust how big is Internet advert ising? Here’s a recent Intern et advertising “Success Story”\nthat’ll shock you. A 21-year old kid, named Alex  Tew, from Wiltshire, England, had a crazy\nidea. It was August and he was going to start at University at the end of September. To make\n54 money for college, he decided to sell Internet advertising. But not  any ordinary advertising. He\ndecided to sell tiny blocks of advertising on the homepage of  a new website. He split the\nhomepage into 10,000 advertising blocks and priced  each one at $100. If he sold them all, he’d\nmake 1 million dollars. So he registered the domain name www.milliondollarhomepage.com,\ncreated the website, and on Friday, August 26th, 2005, he launched his site.\nLong-story short, using publicity  and Internet word-of-mouth (viral marketing), he sold\n9,990 blocks of advertising by December 31st, 2005. At $100 per block, he made $999,000.00 in\njust 4 short months. He sold th e last block of advertising on eBay and it ended up selling for\n$38,100.00 on January 11th, 2006. Total, he made $1,037,100.00 in less than five months. That,\nmy friend, is how H-O-T Intern et advertising sales are!\nInternet Advertising Secret #1:\nThe demand for Internet Advertising is HUGE\nand is growing by leaps and bounds!\nFirst, it’s important to understa nd that advertising itself is a multi-billion dollar industry. From\nTV and radio to magazine and newspaper advertisi ng, billions of dollars ar e spent each year to\npromote various products and services. The Intern et has created an entirely new avenue for\nadvertisers. Second, it’s incredib ly inexpensive to start up an In ternet business. Almost anyone\nwith an idea can buy a domain name for under $10 from TheDomainCenter.com, buy hosting from HostingRiches.com for only $24.95 a month, desi gn a website with free software, and be in\nbusiness in no time. Because of this, there are thousands upon thousands of small businesses on\nthe Internet that didn’t exist be fore. All of these new website ow ners need Internet advertising.\nMany of the largest businesse s on the Internet survive ma inly on advertising revenue.\nTake Google as an example. Google is pulling in money hand-over-fist by selling advertising on\nthe right-hand side of all sear ch results. These are called “Adw ords” and people advertise their\nproducts and services in Google’s search listings and pay whenev er someone clicks on their ad.\nEven though Google charges as li ttle as 5 cents per click, there are so many advertisers, Google\nis pulling in millions of dollars a year with this  one advertising concept. Other search engines\nlike Yahoo also create a majority of their income from search engine advertising.\nThe best thing about Internet a dvertising is that it is conti nually growing. St atistics show\nthat demand for and sales of Internet advertising continues to increase wi th each passing quarter.\nAnd, as more people link to the Internet through high-speed conn ections and as selling products\non the Internet becomes even eas ier, I see the demand for Intern et advertising going through the\nroof.\nHere’s my own real-life success story sell ing Internet advertis ing: After selling\nadvertising on my own website fo r a while, I decided to become a broker for a paid inclusion\nservice with one major search engine. With pa id inclusion you can actually get your client’s\nwebsite in a search engine’s li sting in 72 hours or less. I sold the one-year service for $997 and\nultimately made over 1,300 sales. Do the math and you’ll see that’s over $1,296,100.00 in total sales. In fact, in one month I did over $200,000.00 in sales! And that’s just one of the Internet\nadvertising services I promoted over the years.\nInternet Advertising Secret #2:\n55 You can actually make MORE MONEY as an Internet advertising BROKER.\nWhen I first started sell ing Internet advertisi ng, I sold advertising on my own website. While I\nwas making good money doing this, I soon realized  that there were many limitations to the\namount of money I could make. First,  while I did a lot of work to drive “traffic” (visitors) to my\nwebsite, my site certainly wasn’t one of the most frequently visi ted sites on the Internet. When\npeople pay for Internet advertising, they’re paying to have their advertising put in front of the\nmost people possible. Since my website only rece ived a few thousand visitors a month at the\ntime, I was stuck selling my Internet  advertising for a low price.\nSecond, because I needed to spend time promoti ng my website to build up traffic, I could\nonly spend a portion of my time actually selling Internet advertising. A lot of my time and\nmoney was spent trying to advertis e my site and drive visitors to  it. And, unfortunately, with so\nmuch competition on the Internet, it became an expensive and time-consuming proposition. I\nsoon realized that no matter how much money or time I spent, the traffic to my site had very little\nchance of even reaching the top 25% of all websites.\nThat’s when I stumbled onto the idea of “b rokering”. Instead of se lling advertising on my\nown website, I could become a broker for another website  and sell their advertising! This was\nthe breakthrough for which I’d been looking. No w, instead of spending ANY time or money\ntrying to build traffic, I could go to an already huge website, make a deal with them to broker\ntheir advertising, and instantly have a service I could sell. Finally, I could focus 100% of my\ntime on what was making me the most money: SELLING Internet advertising.\nI soon started brokering relationships with a wide variety of very large websites,\nincluding some major search engi nes. I would sell their services  to my clients, pocket a large\nprofit, and they would perform the servic e. It was the perfect win-win situation.\nHowever, here’s a word of caution:  Whenever you broker advertising for any\nadvertising medium (TV, radio, magazines, newspa pers, or an Internet site), you’re at their\nmercy. If they choose to sever the broker relationsh ip, you can no longer se ll their advertising.\nFor example, I was making a huge amount of mone y selling paid inclusion services provided by\none particular search engine. One day, my office manager (who input the orders with the search\nengine) came to me in a panic about a message she r eceived from the search engine. It stated that\nstarting TODAY the search engine would no longer be offering paid inclusion services. There\nwas absolutely no warning that this was coming.  One day, they were offering this valuable\nservice and the next day, they shut it down comple tely. At the time, we had dozens of customers\nsending in orders every single day for this servi ce and then suddenly we had no service to sell\nthem.\nQuickly, I searched around the Internet for another search engine that offered paid\ninclusion services. I found one , made a broker deal with th em, and changed my marketing\nmaterials to reflect the new serv ice we were providing. Problem solved, right? Not so fast! This\nother search engine, a month later,  decided that they also wanted  to stop offering paid inclusion.\nFortunately, we had about 60 days no tice, so we were able to transi tion to selling another service.\nUnderstand that when you’re br okering advertising from any company, they have complete\ncontrol over the situation. Even  if you’re making them tons of money (like we were for the\n56 search engines), if they decide the advertising service doesn’t fit with their long-term goals they\ncan quickly kill it, leaving you to rush around and find something else to sell.\nMany websites that sell Internet advertising offer affiliate programs. This can be the\neasiest, most hands-free way to make money selli ng Internet advertising. However, if you find a\nwebsite that offers advertisi ng and you’d like to do a deal with them, you can contact their\nmarketing or advertising department and explain that you’d like to work with them. You’ll find\nthat many websites will appreciate having someone  brokering their advertising for them, because\ninstead of having to pay you a salary, you only ge t paid when you make a sale. It’s a no-lose\nsituation for the website a nd a great opportunity for you.\nOnline Auctions/eBay\neBay has become one of the fastest, easiest, and most profitable ways for ordinary people\nto make real money online, without a website! Anyone with a computer and Internet access can\nopen up an account on eBay and within moments,  start listing items around their home for sale.\nThen, within days the auctions are closed, mone y changes hands, and the items get shipped off to\nthe buyers. Some people do this over and over agai n, day after day, and  make a full-time income\njust through eBay.\nIn fact, statistics actually say that over 400,000 people are making money on eBay.\n400,000! That’s an amazing number. But go online and check it out and you’ll see millions upon\nmillions of products being sold by people all over the world. It’s truly an amazing site!\nI’ve both bought and sold items on eBay. I re gularly use eBay to find marketing and\nmoney-making courses at a discount. I recen tly found a $3,000 marketing course for $1,500 and\na real estate course that y ou can only get by attending a $3,00 0 seminar for just $500. On the\nsales side, I sold a domain name on eBay fo r $25,000 (which was wired right into my bank\naccount by the buyer) and even list ed a $699,000 home in their real estate section! EBay is\nabsolutely amazing and a money-making opportunity I highly recommend it for someone who wants to make good money selling items from home.\neBay Secret #1:\nFocus on Selling One Type of Item.\nSome of the most successful marketers on eBay  focus their efforts on one product category. For\nexample, there are people that only collect and sell plastic Breyer horse s. Others only sell old\nbooks on various topics, coins, or collectible movie posters.\nAdam Ginsburg decided to put a pool table fo r auction on eBay “for fun”. It sold for a\nprofit, so he put another one up for auction. In less than a year, he was selling 25 pool tables each\nweek. One year after his first eB ay sale, his sales has increased to 150 to 175 pool table sales per\nweek, which was about $15 MILLION DOLLARS  IN REVENUE-- all thanks to eBay!\nWhen you focus on one type of item, you b ecome an expert in these items. When\nsomeone buys from you, you can capture their co ntact information and keep them on a mailing\n57 list to alert them to other offers and auctions. Plus, if someone purchases an item from you, they\nmay return and ask you if you have similar items.\neBay Secret #2:\nYou can sell items you don’t own and make big profits!\nThe best way to explain this secret is to give  you a quick “case study”. Re cently, a friend of mine\nneeded some quick cash so he went to eBay a nd did a quick search of collectibles that were\nselling well and had a history of selling well. He  stumbled onto Hummel figurines, and he wrote\ndown the names of the most popular ones and what they were selling for on eBay.\nHe then went to a few local antique stores  and found one that had a large selection of\nHummel figurines. One figurine, selling for a bout $1,200 at the antique store, was consistently\nselling for $2,800 on eBay. He asked the antique stor e to hold it for him and he rushed home and\nposted the figurine on eBay. Within a week, th e figurine had sold for about $2,800. He took the\nmoney from the auction, paid the antique stor e $1,200, shipped the figurine to the customer, and\npocketed about $1,600.\nNow you might be wondering what would ha ppen if the bidding never went above\n$1,200, the price the figurine was selling for at the antique store. First, my friend checked to\nmake sure they were consistently selling well. So they all had a proven track record. Second, he\nput a “reserve” on the auction, so that the auction had to clear at least $1,200 for anyone to win\nthe figurine. Within one week, he was able to clear $1,600 in pr ofit on an item he didn’t even\nown. Many people make a few extra hundred or thousand dollars a month putting items from\nlocal antique stores on eBay.\nEBay Secret #3:\nE-books can make you money on eBay.\nMost of the items being sold on eBay are tangibl e items. They’re physical products that have to\nbe shipped to you. Antiques, coins, Beanie Babi es, books, whatever. However, if you search for\n“e-books” on eBay, you’ll find thousands of listings . (When I did a search a minute ago, I found\n15,099 listings when I searched unde r the keyword “e-books” on eBay.)\nYou’ll find that many of these e-books are se lling for 99 cents! And yes, while the e-\nbooks can be downloaded – and don’t have to be  shipped, how can anyone create an extra\nincome off of 99-cent e-books?\nThe money to be made is NOT off of each 99-ce nt sale. The money to be made is in what\nhappens AFTER the customer buys your e-book. For example, inside each e-book are affiliate links for other products. When someone read s your e-book, you can recommend that they\npurchase various products. When they do, you can get a commission (sometimes a very large commission). Of course, if you promote your  own products, you’ll make even more money.\nAlso, when someone buys the e-book from you, you can include an affiliate link in the\nreceipt email that’s automatically sent to them. Or direct them to your website. You can capture\ntheir email address on your site and sell them higher-priced products and services.\n58 Finally, you can also give the buyer the re sell rights to your e-book and let the e-book\nduplicate itself like crazy. Imagine if you sold 10 copies of your e-book on eBay and you let each\nperson duplicate and sell unlimited copies. And let’ s say that each of these 10 people sold it to\n100 more people. That’s 1,000 people who have your e-Book, with your affiliate links and\npossibly a link to your website. If each of these 1,000 people give it away to an additional 10\npeople, there are now 10,000 copies  of your e-book circulating. And there’s no cost to you. It all\nstarted by putting your e-book in front of  millions of potential buyers on eBay!\nRecommended Resources\nJohn Reese’s Auction Secrets System\nJohn Reese is an eBay marketing expert . He’s been involved with eBay and\nonline auctions since the very beginni ng and has made some great money along\nthe way. One auction John comp leted gave him a profit of $38,450.27 from just\none sale!    Now, John has released a video tr aining system that shows you exactly\nhow you can start from home and make a pa rt-time or full-time income on eBay. I\nlike John’s system because most “Make Money on eBay” information is in book form. For instance go to your local books tore or library and you’ll find many\nbooks on how to make money on eBay, but they’re all print, with very few (if any) pictures. With John’s system, you get a video or DVD that will walk you\nthrough each and every step of making a re al, honest income using the power of\neBay’s auction system. Highly recommended.

In read ing books on mail order marketi ng, I stumbled onto the concept\nof getting free publicity. For the next few years, I grew my business from  nothing to six-figures\nusing mostly free and low-cost publicity methods.\nOne of the stories I stumbled onto during my  research into publicity methods was the\nstory of Harold Moe. Harold Moe was an air line pilot who wrote a book entitled “How to Make\nYour Paycheck Last”. Now Harold didn’t have a pile of money to advertise his book, but he’d\nheard about free publicity. So he decided to wr ite and send out a pres s release announcing the\nrelease of his book.\nIt’s a story that’s legendar y among most marketers. Harold Moe spent one first-class\nstamp to mail his press release to Family Circle Magazine. Family Circle, impressed with his book, included a small write-up about Harold’s b ook with the price and ordering information. In\nthe next 60 days, Harold Moe sold about  $3.5 MILLION DOLLARS worth of his small book.\nAnd it only cost him ON E FIRST-CLASS STAMP!\nMany people have created virtual fortunes wi th free and low-cost marketing methods,\nincluding press releases and publicity. Joe Sabah sold 23,750 copies of his book, \"How to Get the\nJob You Really Want and Get Employers to Call YOU” – by speaking on over 650 radio stations!\nPaul Hartunian got on The Tonight Show (with J ohnny Carson) when he sent out a press release\nthat told of him selling the Brooklyn Bridge. (H e was actually selling scrap lumber from the\n60 Brooklyn Bridge in small 1” x 1” squares). Paul Hartunian has gone on to sell a wide variety of\nproducts and services through free publicity.\nPress Release Secret:\nGive The Media What They Want!\nTo get free publicity, you have to give the medi a what they want, NOT what you want. Yes, you\nwant to promote your product and make a ton of money. However, the media already has a\ndepartment that will help you do that: The A dvertising Department. To get free publicity, your\nproduct or service must appeal  to THE NEWS DEPARTMENT! Y our product or service must\nhave a story wrapped around it. Does  it illustrate a current fad? Is it an incredible new invention?\nIs it weird, unique, crazy, or odd ? Is it wrapped up in a human -interest story? Think like a\njournalist and do some research to find the STOR Y inside your product or service. What would\nthe viewers of a certain TV  or radio station (or th e readers of a magazine, newspaper, or Internet\nsite) really want to know about ? If you can give the media a st ory that they can publish, you’re\nlikely to get free publicity.\nFor example, Paul Hartunian sold a book on how to find the love of your life. Before\nevery Valentine’s Day, he would send out press rele ases to TV networks and newspapers. Within\nhours of faxing out his press releas e, he’d have interviews lined up, each wanting to feature him\nand help him promote his product. The media need s stories. They’re in a constant search for\nsomething new. If you can give them hot, fr esh information, wrapped around your product, it’s\nlikely you can get thousands of dollars in free publicity.\nRecommended Resource:\nFor more information on making money w ith free publicity, check  out the website\nwww.publicityprofits.com\nJoint Venture Secrets\nOne way to make a lot of money without much  risk is through joint ventures. A joint\nventure is a deal, between two marketing partners, where each brings something of value and\nboth profit. For example, you might have a hot pr oduct but no money to a dvertise it. You could\ntake your product to a company with a large cust omer mailing list and do a joint venture with\nthem where they’ll spend their ow n money to market your product to  their list in exchange for\n50% to 60% of all sales made. It’s a win-win s ituation. Your joint ventur e partner creates cash\nfrom a product they didn’t have to create a nd you make money without putting up any of your\nown cash.\nPersonally, I’ve had incredible success with jo int ventures. A few years ago, I did a joint\nventure with a company that had tens of thousands of customers.  I had a $997 product that sold\nvery well to my own small mailing list, but I ran out of customers to sell it to. So I took my offer\nto this larger company and made them a deal. If  they paid to print and mail the sales letter to\ntheir own mailing list, I’d let them  keep 60% of all of the sales that came in. They accepted and\nimmediately mailed out approximately 20,000 copies of my offer to their best list. Long story\n61 short, that one offer generated roughly $1.1 million dollars in just 12 short weeks! And with my\n40% share, I made about $440,000.00 with NO Market ing Costs! Of course, my joint venture\npartner profited, too-- so we both won big!\nEditor’s Note:  A reader asked how the money is collected, how is the deal set up,\nand how are the order fulfilled. The truth is that there are as many ways to\nstructure joint ventures as there are pote ntial joint venture partners. However, in\nthe previous example, here’s how the joint venture worked. I gave my joint\nventure partner the original files of my sales letter and order form. They changed\nthe order form so that all phone, fax, and mail order were to come directly to\nthem. They processed all check and credit  card orders in-house. Then, every day,\nI received the original order forms by fa x. (Today, I would request that the orders\nbe emailed daily in an spreadsheet.) At least once a month (oft en twice a month),\nI was written a check for 40% of the gro ss sales made since my last check was\ncut. I shipped all orders from my own o ffice. Also, as customer’s had questions\nabout the product, they were directed to contact us, since we were the creator of\nthe product. If a customer contacted us fo r a refund, we would either refer them to\nour joint venture partner to request a refund – or simply  contact the joint venture\npartner ourselves to have them proce ss the refund. Our portion of each refund was\neither taken out of future sales – or, once sales stopped coming in, were sent as a\ncheck back to the joint venture partne r. Of course, you can set up your joint\nventures to run in any way you and your joint venture partners choose.\nTo do joint ventures, you must have one of  two things. Either you must have a HOT\nproduct with a high profit margin (since you’ll be  giving up a substantial amount of your profits\nto your joint venture partner), or you must have a high-quality customer mailing list.\nIF\nYou Have a High Profit Margin Product or Service--  finding joint venture partners\ncan be as easy as contacting companies selling similar products to your target market. For example, if I’m selling Internet advertising, the best company to do a joint venture with would be\na company selling website design. In fact, one of the very first extremely profitable joint\nventures I did in the late 1990’s was with a co mpany selling website design. I had just started\nselling Internet advertising on my website and created a special  “Advertising Package” for $497.\nI mailed a special letter to 5,000 of this compa ny’s best clients and generated 282 sales or\nroughly $140,154.00 in gross sales. I split that with the website design company and kept about\n$70,077.00! Since then, I’ve let many other compan ies promote my products and services to\ntheir clients in exchange for a portion of the profits. Once you find a potential joint venture\npartner, setting up a deal can be as easy as sendi ng a letter, fax, or email and explaining your\nproposal. Remember, the more prof its you’re willing to give to your joint venture partner (50%\nto 60% or so), the more likely th ey’ll be willing to work with you.\nIF\nYou Have a High-Quality Customer Mailing List--  then you may not have to do\nanything to engage in joint ventures. I know of many compan ies (mine included) who are\ncontacted on a regular basis by ot her companies wanting to do joint ventures. This goes back to\nwhat I said earlier in this book. Your mailing list is  your most valuable asset. Products are a dime\na dozen. Everyone has a book or course they want  to sell. But a mailing list is incredibly\n62 valuable. So if you have a list, you’ll probably star t to receive many offers for joint ventures. If\nyou’re not receiving offers, you can contact companies advertising products or services you wish\nto promote to your own mailing list. Finding a company to do a joint venture with can be as simple as picking up a magazine in your niche market or doing a fast Internet search. Very\nquickly, you can have 5, 10, even 20 potential produc ts that you can promot e to your mailing list.\nNow you simply contact the company selling the product and suggest a pr ofitable joint venture\nfor them. Remember, since you own the mailing list, you’ll want to keep a good portion of the profits per sale, from 50% to 60% or more.\nRecommended Resource\nFor more information on making money with joint ventures, go to\nwww.jvmillions.com\nSelling Domain Names\nFor a low fee of only $99 per year, you can start one of the hottest Internet businesses:\ndomain name registration .

The names being\nsold in the magazines are (a) lower quality  names and (b) mailed into oblivion by people\npromoting chain letters, pyramid schemes, and ot her worthless junk. Becoming a dealer for these\ntype of low-cost mailing lists is a bad idea.  While you may make some money, your customers\nwill ultimately come back to you, unhappy with the low response and the high number of\nundeliverables. My advice is to leave the mailing lists to the professiona l list brokers who know\nwhat they’re doing. If you want to truly get into  this business and beco me a professional list\nbroker, understand that you’ll have  to invest a chunk of money into computer equipment and\nspend a lot of time networking to break into th e field. Organizations th at have established\nrelationships with their list management compan ies aren’t likely to move to a new, unproven\nstart-up.\nSelling Security Products\nIf you read the money-making magazines, you’ve  probably seen the ads that yell, “Sell\nSecurity Products”. Door alarms, Pepper Spray, Ta sers, and other items to keep you safe in this\ncrazy world. Before jumping into this opportun ity, make sure you know who your market is and\nhow you’ll reach them. It’s not likely that you have  the deep pockets to pay for TV or radio\nadvertising. And ads in large magazines can also  easily cost you thousan ds of dollars. Direct\n64 mail is expensive (printing, postage, and mailing list) , but it can be effectiv e. That is, IF you find\nthe right mailing list. But what IS the right ma iling list for security products? People who have\nbeen robbed recently? One thing that marketers u nderstand is that it’s almost impossible to SELL\nPREVENTION. People want to buy the solution to their problems. They rarely spend money to\nprevent a problem. That’s why more home alarm systems are sold to people who have already\nhad a break-in occur, than people who have ne ver had a break-in. If you do plan on selling\nsecurity products, you’ll need to find and sell to people who have already been affected by crime.\nThat’s your target market.\nSelling Products at Local Flea Markets and Fairs\nYou can make good money selling items at lo cal flea markets and fairs-- IF you do your\nresearch and find out (a) what items sell the best  at these events and (b) what flea markets and\nfairs draw the largest crowds. Honestly, even before you do that, you should make sure you have\nthe desire to make money selling at flea market s and fairs. Often, you’ll spend much of your time\noutside, exposed to the elements (even if you’re in a covered booth, it can be hard to get away\nfrom the heat, cold, wind, rain, etc.). You’ll sp end a lot of time on your feet and a lot of time\ntalking face-to-face with people. If  that doesn’t fit your personality, then flea markets and fairs\nare not a good fit for you. If it is, however, you should go to the type of events you plan to sell at\nand see what booths are the most popular. At a recent Art Fair in my area, I noticed that a booth\nwith whimsical artwork of cats and dogs was doi ng phenomenally well. So well, in fact, it was\nhard to fit into the boo th to look at the artwork. I was so  impressed with the crowd, I asked\nmyself why this booth would be doing so well,  when there were many, many other booths all\nselling artwork of various sorts.  It seemed obvious to me after a little thought. Ma ny people have\nat least a cat or dog. So whimsical artwork li ke this would be more popular than artwork\nfeaturing flowers or buildings. Many people in the booth were sa ying that “This painting looks\nlike Fluffy.” Or “This one definitely looks lik e Buster” and the art wa s selling like hotcakes.\nEven better, there were various sizes and prices of art. So so meone with a smaller budget could\nget a postcard-sized picture and someone with a larger budget could get a wall-sized piece.\nYou should do the same type of investigation be fore selling something at a flea market or\nfair. Go and see what people are buying. What b ooths are packed? How is the booth set up? How\ndo they accept payment? Checks only or do they accep t credit cards? How is their pricing? Do\nthey have competition? How do they attract at tention from people walking by? These are all\nthings to take into consideration before trying to sell anything at local flea markets or fairs.\nOnce you’ve done your homework, it’s time to te st your ideas regarding what will sell. I\nsuggest starting small, without i nvesting too much in inventory or  equipment. You don’t want to\nspend $5,000 to $10,000 for a fully outfitted booth, complete with canopy and credit card machine, only to discover you’re only making $100 a weekend. Start small on a tiny budget and\nsee what happens. If you find yourself selling ou t over and over again, invest your profits in a\nbetter booth and a merchant account to let you take credit cards. Do your research, start small,\ntest a few things, and you could start to s ee nice profits from your part-time business.\n65 Selling Advertising Specialties\nThere are a few business opportunity co mpanies offering you the chance to sell\nadvertising specialties, and I’ll be honest-- I’m on the fen ce as to whether it’s a good opportunity\nor not.\nOn the plus side, the advert ising specialty business is a booming business. Just do a\nsearch on the Internet for advertising speci alties and you’ll see large multi-million dollar\ncompanies selling thousands of products (mugs, sh irts, pens, paperweights , calendars, etc.) that\ncan be imprinted with a company’s name and l ogo. Companies all around the world consistently\nbuy advertising specialties, and I believe th ere will be a demand for these items for the\nforeseeable future.\nOn the minus side-- if YOU get involved in th is industry, you’ll be competing with these\nsame multi-million dollar companies. Yes, you can jo in one company that will sell you a turn-\nkey advertising specialties busines s and use their infrastructure to help you sell, produce, and\nship the advertising spec ialties. They’ll provide you with th e catalogs and all you do is make the\nsales. Then, you simply forward the sales to the company, they imprint the materials, and ship\nthem (under your name) to your clie nt. It’s a pretty  neat set-up.\nMy only concern is your competition. Some a dvertising specialty companies (including\nthe one I use) are incredibly pr ofessional, with full- color catalogs, huge sear chable websites, and\na customer service staff that’s second to none. Th ere’s little that an in dividual can do to set\nhimself or herself apart from these giant companies.\nHowever, having said that, I do believe th at IF you know marke ting and IF you’re a\ncreative person, you may be able to develop a ni che for yourself by making the rounds of local\nbusinesses in your area and showing them exactly how to increase their sa les through the use of\nadvertising specialties. You see, most people w ho buy imprinted pens or mugs don’t have a real\nplan on what to do with them. They get a fl yer in the mail, they know other companies buy\nimprinted pens, they think that would be cool (“Wow... We’ll have a PEN with our name on it!”)\nand they buy 1,000. Then they spend the next  20 years giving away pens! YOU can be a\nbusiness’ marketing “hero” by contacting local businesses and showing them how to increase\nsales through the use of adve rtising specialties. However, before you can do that, YOU must\nunderstand how to increase sales through ad spec ialties. If you don’t have that knowledge, you’ll\nneed it. It may ultimately be your only advant age over all of the othe r advertising specialty\ncompanies.\nSelling Weight Loss Products and Services\nThe weight loss, diet, fitness, and health industry is a multi-billion dollar industry and it\ncontinues to grow with each passing year. Because it is such a large industry, it’s easy to\nunderstand why so many busine ss opportunities and network ma rketing opportunities feature\nproducts that help people lose weight , have more energy, or get healthier.\nOne of the challenges with jumping into a la rge industry like this, with a lot of other\nsmart marketers, is that you ’re having to compete with th e best-of-the-best. Can you make\n66 money selling weight loss products? You bet. Billi ons of dollars are made each year. However,\nthose billions are made by the likes of Jenny Cr aig, Weight Watchers, and 24-Hour Fitness, not\nto mention the huge nutraceutical companies. Th ese are multi-million dollar corporations with\ndeep, deep pockets. They have the ability to re ach the masses with their message of weight loss,\nfitness, and health.\nIF you are thinking about promoting a wei ght loss product of any kind, first you must\nhave a HOOK! Weight Watchers has POINTS . The Atkins Diet fo cuses on LOW CARBS! 8-\nSecond Abs could help you get abs in just 8 SE CONDS! (Of course, now they have 6-Second, 5-\nSecond, and even 3-Second Abs! Pretty soon they’ll have INSTANT ABS!) You can’t sell\nanother “Me-Too” product. Your pr oduct has to be faster, easier, better, more effective, etc.\nSecond, I’m guessing that you won’t be able to a fford the millions of dollars corporations\nspend on their television, radio, and magazine  advertising campaigns. No problem. You can\nTARGET your advertising message by mailing dire ct mail pieces to lists of people who have\npreviously bought weight loss products. Direct ma il is expensive, so you’ll need to TEST your\noffer (to about 5,000 people) to make sure it’ ll work. IF it works with the initial 5,000 mailing,\nyou can do another 5,000 test just to make sure  your results are consistent. Then, with good\nsales, you can rollout and start mailing more.\nIt’s a very competitive market, full of smart marketers who know their stuff. If you’re\ngoing to try and be successful se lling a weight loss product, y ou have to know what you’re\ndoing.\nRecommended Resource\nIf you have an interest in promoting h ealth and beauty products (a huge multi-\nbillion dollar industry), I highly recommend checking out the Joe Bucks Herbal\nAffiliate Program.

If you spot a fad or a trend, you may have a few weeks,\nmaybe a few months to cash in. Often, when a new invention or fad is  popular, you’ll see dozens\nof companies selling business opportunities offe ring YOU the “once-in-a- lifetime” chance to get\nrich quick with the fad.\n67 For example, for a short while, 900 number s were huge! Companies were promoting\npsychic lines, horoscope lines, advice lines, gossip lin es and, of course, the se x lines. At the same\ntime, companies were also leasing 900 number li nes to entrepreneurs a nd showing them how to\nset up their own 900 numbers. Books and course s on 900 numbers were H-O-T! For a short\nperiod of time, selling the 900 number opportun ity was making some people very wealthy\nindeed. However, as 900 numbers became more  regulated and the te chnology to block 900\nnumbers became more prevalent, they died down and most companies got out of the business of\nre-selling 900 numbers. Today, you can search most business opportunity magazines and not\nfind a single ad offering 900 numbers.\nThe challenge with selling fad items, or items tied to a trend, is that you can never be too\nsure how long the selling cycle will last. Fads can die out quickly. Almost overnight. And you\ncan be stuck with inventory that you can’t even give away. Trends can change a little slower but\nagain, if you build your business ar ound a trend that may last only a few years, you still need to\nkeep in mind that the money will stop flowing in sooner or later.\nI’m not saying you shouldn’t cash in while you ha ve a very clear opportunity. I’m simply\nsuggesting that you carefully invest igate any type of fad or trend before you jump in with both\nfeet. A little research can he lp you save a lot of money.\nStarting a Service Business\nThese types of businesses in clude carpet cleaning, pest control, blind cleaning, car\nwashing, painting, travel agency, mortgage reduction, engraving, power washing, credit\nconsulting, or any number of similar services.\nWhile I won’t cover each one individually, ther e are a few things to know before getting\ninvolved in starting a service business.\nFirst, you need to have the personality to run a service business. In most cases, you’ll\nneed to have great social skills and a desire to talk to people face-to-face. If you’re outgoing,\nfriendly, and like talking to people, a se rvice business could be a perfect fit.\nSecond, it’s important that you like the serv ice you’ll be performing. Yes, even if you\nwant to hire people to actually  perform the service for you, it’ s good if you have passion for the\nbusiness you’re running. After all, before you can afford to hire people, you might just have to\nclean some carpets yourself. You’ll find that you ’re willing to spend more time building and\ngrowing your business IF you like the service that the business will perform. For example, I can’t\nimagine running a carpet cleaning business. And pest control and power washing would be the\nlast things on my list. But an engraving service is intriguing, because it ha s a creative element to\nit, which I like. And I like th e idea of being a travel agen t (even though I wouldn’t recommend\nyou get involved in this area, be cause of the drastic changes in the travel industry) because I\nenjoy traveling. Finding something that fits you r personality and passions will increase the\nlikelihood that you’ll be successful with it.\nAgain, as with ANY OPPORTUNITY you’re thinking about investing in, DO YOUR\nRESEARCH! I can’t stress this enough. I’m always shocked when I hear stories of people\n68 investing $10,000 to $25,000 or more to start a bu siness – and they have n’t read the industry\nmagazines, talked to other business owners in th e same industry, or even done a simple search on\nthe search engines. You can’t choose a business ba sed on the “Success Stories” of the people that\nappear in the ad. Those are what  I call the “Best Case Scenarios” . You need to do your own due\ndiligence, check out the market for this type of service business, and make an educated choice on whether this business is right for you and right for the area in  which you choose to start it. A\nlittle research can save  you a ton of money!\nIn Conclusion...\nThere are a lot of great o pportunities available for you to investigate. With the\ninformation in this chapter, my hope is that you’ll be able to choose the right opportunity for\nyou. In the next chapter, I’ll reveal the secrets behind many of the most popular, widely-\nadvertised get-rich-quick programs.\n69 3\nSecrets Behind Crazy,\nWacky, Wild, Weird, and Odd\nGet-Rich-Quick Programs\nMaybe you’ve seen the ads in  the money-making magazines. Pictures of huge mansions,\nluxury cars, boats, airplanes, and almost unbeliev able stories of people going from poverty to\nwealth overnight. Inside this chapter, I’ll reveal the secret s behind the good, the bad, and the\nreally, really ugly.\nHow to Make Over $387,000 Doing Absolutely Nothing\nIt’s funny how the titles of these opportunities neve r really tell “the whole story” behind them.\nThe author of this opportunity reveals that by selling money-making programs in the business opportunity magazines and through direct mail, he generates a rather large mailing list of buyers.\nEvery quarter he sends his list manager these na mes, and they’re rented by other companies who\nwant to mail to them. Every time the mailing lis ts are rented, he gets  a commission check. Since\nhe started renting his list s out (through his list manager), he ge nerated the large six-figure income\nin the title of his book. While you could argue that the title is accurate (o nce he sends the names\nto the list manager, the list mana ger does all of the work of promoting and renting the names, and\nhe gets a commission check on a regular basis for “doing nothing”), it cert ainly doesn’t tell the\nentire story. To get those thousa nds and thousands of buyer names, the author of this system had\nto create a hot-selling product and invest m oney by marketing it through expensive magazine\nadvertising and direct mail. Anyone who has run a mail order company knows that creating\nproducts, writing copy, and placing ads is  not considered “doing nothing”.\nHow to Turn Your Junk Mail Into Cold, Hard Cash\nThere are a few variations on this money-making system. The first (and most popular) concept is\nto become a distributor for mailing lists and, as  “junk mail” (also known as “direct mail”) arrives\nin your mailbox, you send your flyer selling mailing lists BACK to the marketer who mailed you\nthe junk mail. The thinking here is that since th e marketer originally pa id for a mailing list to\nsend YOU his information, he’s a BUYER of mailing lists and you’re more likely to get him to\nbuy a mailing list from you. There’s one problem I have  with that concept: IF the marketer has\nbeen doing direct mail for quite some time and is e xperienced in this field,  he or she will have\ncontacts with a list broker who can  get him or her almost any list.  It’s rare that they’ll buy and\ntest a mailing list from an unknown source. (Not impo ssible, just rare). Other systems using this\nsame concept have to do with selling the marketer  printing (since he needs to print his direct mail\npieces) or selling him other things, like copywri ting services or disp lay advertising in\nopportunity publications.\n70 Another variation on this concept shows you “How to Make BIG BUCKS from Full-Page\nAds in the Money-Making Magazines”. Again, the id ea is to sell these advertisers products and\nservices, from printing and envelopes to advert ising in other publica tions and mailing lists.\nHow to Get Paid $2 for Each Envelope You Stuff\nThis is an OLD money-making concept and the ve ry first one I ever fell for 19 years ago. There\nare a bunch of different version of this, but th ey all revolve around the same basic concept.\nHere it is:  Company A sells you thei r “Envelope Stuffing Kit” for approximately $29.95.\nSometimes it’s less, sometimes more, but it’s often right around $30 bucks. With that, you get a\nclassified ad to place in your local newspaper (o r in magazines) and instructions on what to do\nwith the envelopes. The system tells you to pl ace the classified ads (which say, “Make Big\nMoney From Home! Send $2 and Self-Addressed St amped Envelope To [Your Address]”) and\nwhen people send you $2 and the self-addressed stamped envelope (S.A.S.E.), you keep the\n$2.00. You put a flyer in the S.A.S.E. that se lls Company A’s home-business booklet for about\n$20 bucks. Sometimes you get to keep a portio n of this $20 sale, but often, you don’t.\nThis is a GREAT deal for Company A and a horrible deal for the person who purchased\nthe Envelope Stuffing Kit. Here’s why: First,  Company A makes a bunch of money selling the\nenvelope stuffing kit. Because the actual system  rarely, if ever, works, the company counts on\nmaking 99.9% of its money selling the envelope st uffing kit. Second, virtually no one is going to\nsend you $2 AND a self-addressed STAMPED envelope based on a few words in a classified ad.\nYou’ll be lucky to get any res ponse from an ad like that. And third, IF you do get a response,\nyou’ve made a whopping $2. However, Company A now  has the ability to get their offer to a\nserious prospect with NO RISK! The prospect se nt in an envelope, pr e-addressed and stamped,\nso if the prospect doesn’t buy the home-busine ss booklet, Company A is only out the cost of a\nsingle flyer. BUT, if the prospect pays for the home business booklet, Company A pockets some\nmoney with no risk. It’s a no-lo se situation for Company A and an almost no-win situation for\nthe person who purchases the envelope stuffing kit.\nOther companies have changed the basic con cept to allow the “envelope stuffer” to\nbecome a distributor of the home business book and put their own name and address on the flyer,\nprint up copies, and insert it into each S.A.S.E. Then when orders come in, the envelope stuffer\nkeeps about 50% of each sale and sends the rest to Company A for drop shipping. Again,\nCompany A still makes 99.9% of its money se lling the envelope stuffing kit. Giving the\nenvelope stuffer a portion of each booklet sale ma de it simply an enticem ent to get them to buy\nthe envelope stuffing kit. Since the ad conti nues to ask for $2 and a self-addressed stamped\nenvelope, your responses will always be very low.\nBy the way, if you’ve seen any of these offers, they make it seem as though they’ll be\nsending you the envelopes, stamps, and names to ma il the offers to. However, if you read them\ncarefully, you’ll see that most of them say, “All envelopes, stamps, and addresses WILL BE\nPROVIDED TO YOU.” Yes, they’ll be provide d to you BY THE PROSPECT who responds to\nyour ad. Wording that suggests that the comp any will be sending you these items makes your\n“small” investment of $29.95 seem like nothing.\n71 How to Make Money Assemb ling Products From Home\nUgh! I’ve heard nothing but ho rror stories about these “wor k-at-home assembling products”\noffers. The basic pitch is simple: A company th at sells craft items is looking for people to\nassemble these items from home and get paid  for each piece assembled and returned to\nheadquarters. You can do as much “work” as  you want, but the more you do, the more you get\npaid. Easy, right?\nWrong. Many of these companies (As far as I know, all of them) charge you a fee, from\n$15 to $30 or more, to qualify to assemble products . Then, the company sends you a starter kit of\ncrafts to assemble and usually a completed samp le so you can see how your  craft is to look once\nfinished. So you start assembling, finish one, a nd mail it back to the company for payment.\nSurprise, surprise. Your item wasn’t assembled “up to the standards set by headquarters”. It’s\nsent back, and you’re asked to tr y again. You try again and send it back. Once again, it’s rejected\n– with a note to keep trying. Often, you’ll never be  paid for assembling these items. If you are,\nit’s next to nothing. And you’d have to assemble  hundreds, even thousands of products to make\nany decent amount of money.\nIt’s a pitch that has worked very, very we ll over the years for the companies willing to\nsell it, because the work sounds  so easy-- it can be done from home, you’re your own boss\nworking on your own schedule, and it appears to be the pe rfect way to make a little extra cash.\nUnfortunately, the only person that profits from this  opportunity is the company that sells the kits\nto the people who wish to assemble them.\nHow to Get Paid Big Money for Taking Simple Photographs\nLike most opportunity ads, the promises are grea t, but the details are sp arse. The secret behind\nthis opportunity is the fact that you work (as an independent contra ctor) for real estate investors\nin your area. You’re paid (per as signment) to drive around to potential  real estate properties, take\npictures, and deliver them to the busy real estate  investor. The idea is that you can work for many\ndifferent real estate invest ors in your area, spend your da y driving around, taking simple\nphotographs of potential investment properties, and get paid. I’m not  sure that this idea is a\nwinner. The real estate investor s I know either check out the properties them selves, first-hand, or\nhave a trained staff member check out each po tential investment prope rty. You’d have to do\nmore research to see if this con cept is a viable money-making idea.\nHow to Get FREE CASH GRANTS\nfrom Foundations and the Government\nIn the late 1980’s and early 1990’ s, I did a bunch of research on grants. I wrote a book on getting\ngrants and was the co-author of another book on free money. I’ve done hundreds of hours of\nexhaustive research on this exciting topic so  I can give you the “str aight dirt” on grants.\nHere’s the truth (but you may not like it):  You’ve seen the ads that seem to claim that\nyou can get $25,000... $100,000... even $250,000 or more fo r virtually anything. Pay off your\nbills, buy a new car, pay off your home, go on vacation. The ads make it seem like there’s an\nendless pile of money that f oundations and government agencies are willing to give away to\nanyone for any reason. I’m here to tell you, that’s NOT true.\n72 First, MOST private foundations DO NOT awar d grants to individua ls. Most foundations\naward grants to agencies and charities. Those agen cies and charities then use that money to fund\ntheir good works. Second, the U.S. Government doe s give financial assist ance to individuals, but\nyou often have to qualify, fill out paperwor k, and it usually comes with restrictions.\nIf you’re serious about getting a grant, unders tand that there’s a pr ocess for applying and\nqualifying for this money. You have to have a good reason for wanting the money. Paying bills\nor buying a home, while you might think is the pe rfect reason, will not satisfy most foundations\nor agencies awarding money. Money that is awarded is usually gi ven for education, the arts, the\nadvancement of science, or any of a number of humanitarian reasons. Ther e’s a lot of paperwork\nto fill out, you must qualify, and then your app lication must be reviewed and accepted by a panel\nbefore it’ll be funded. Some foundations hold meeti ngs to review grant applications only once or\ntwice a year. So if you miss the d eadline, you’ll have to wait a y ear before your application is\neven reviewed. And if it is accepted, you’re not cut a check immediately. Often, you’re given\npayments over time. And the foundation may wish to check on the progre ss of your project to\nmake sure the funds are being spent accordingly.  You may even have to provide an accounting\nof how the money was used.\nIt’s exciting to think about qualifying for FR EE MONEY! After all, without the dream of\n“something for nothing”, no one would play the lott ery or travel to Las Vegas. I’ve known two\npeople who made an absolute fortune selling “Free Money” information. And there’s another\nperson I heard about that’s selling “Free Money” information on the Internet at\nwww.freecollegecash.com – and has made MILLI ONS of dollars so far, and the money\ncontinues to roll in. It’s a “mag ic” topic that captures people’s im agination and it lures a lot of\npeople in.\nOne of the ways people get hooked into buying information on grants and “free money”\nis that there are a handful of programs that  do give money for housi ng and other types of\nfinancial assistance for individuals. However, th e number of them are few, you must qualify, and\noften you’re competing for a limited amount of money with a lot of other highly qualified\npeople. The fact that these programs exist does NOT  guarantee that they’re easy to qualify for or\nthat you’ll have any chance of receiving this free money.\nWhen I was doing my research on grants, I stumbled onto some great books by author\nLaurie Blum. You can still find her books at your local bookstore or th rough Amazon.com. One\nof her more popular books is called The Complete  Guide to Getting a Grant: How to Turn Your\nIdeas Into Dollars. Highly recommended if you’re interested in looking into getting grants.\nHow to Get Paid $1 For Every Name and Addr ess You Compile\nIf nothing else, the opportunity marketers are creative writers. The ad for this opportunity\nexplains that you will get paid $1 for every name and address you compile. Send in 1 name, you make $1. Send in 100, you get $100. Send in 1,000 names, you get $1,000. You get the picture. The ad also states that there is NO LIMIT to the number of names and addresses you send in and\nyou’ll get paid $1 for every one!\n73 Here’s the secret:  It’s the EXACT SAME secret as th e ad that states you’ll make $2 for\nevery envelope you stuff. The only thing that changes is the way the concept is presented.\nBasically, you again place an ad  for a home-business booklet and ask the prospect to send you $1\nplus a self-addressed stamped envelope. When you receive a re sponse from someone who saw\nthe ad, you keep the $1 and you send the S.A.S.E. (with the prospect’s name and address) to\nheadquarters. The tone of the ad makes it seem as though you can write down names and addresses out of your local phone book and get paid  $1 each. However, the truth is that you have\nto place ads (with your own money) and hope th at someone will go to the trouble of sending you\n$1 AND a S.A.S.E. for more information. Again, as I stated before, you’re more likely to get struck by lightning than you are to  get a response from these types of ads. And, if you do, it’s\nonly $1 for you but a potential $20 sales for the company that sold you this kit.\nHow to Turn Your Fax Machine Into an ATM\nThis is yet another ad that doe sn’t tell the entire story. If you  run a mail order business selling\nanything, and you have a merchant account (which gives you the ab ility to process credit card\norders), you can receive orders via your fax machine anytime, 24 hours a day. For example, it’s\n10:50PM right now and a few moments ago, I heard my fax machine receive another order for a\npromotion I recently mailed out. In the past, I’ve  had days where my fax machine has cranked\nout tens of thousands of dollars  in orders. In just one day!\nHowever, that’s a far cry from “turning your fax machine into an ATM”. The ad makes it\nsound instantaneous. The reality is that you must fi rst create a hot-selling offer, market it to the\nright list, and THEN your fax machine can accept orders. And th is process of finding the right\nmarket, creating a product, and advertising it can  easily take weeks or months to do correctly.\nYou can get a lot of money through your fax mach ine, but only if you have a hot offer that\npeople are willing to buy. And, if you do, you’ ll also receive money in your mail AND by phone.\nHow to Get Paid to Watch  Your Favorite TV Shows\nThe opportunity marketers understand that the easier they can make  their money-making\nschemes sound, the more likely people are to buy them. And how much easier can you make it\nthan “getting paid to watch your favorite TV shows”.\nThe concept here is to become a TV Criti c! You critique TV shows for your local\nnewspaper and get paid. Ta Da! Yep, that’s it. Ex citing, isn’t it. Of course, that’s much harder\nthan it sounds. First, you’d have to have some  writing ability. Second, the position would have to\nbe available. And third, there are very few TV-only critics. I wouldn’ t quit what you’re doing\nnow to run off and become a TV critic. (You’d have more success running off and joining the\ncircus!)\nThere’s another plan called “$1 Million Dolla r Cash Vision,” which also shows you how\nto get rich with TV. However, this book s hows you how to create and produce-- Your Own\nInfomercial. Another dismal idea! While TV info mercials CAN be highly profitable, they’re also\nincredibly expensive to produce and only a sm all number of infomercials end up making any\nmoney. It takes deep, deep pockets to produce an infomercial and even deeper pockets to keep it\nrunning while you tweak it until it finally starts working.\n74 Make $25,000 for Assembling “One” Product\nThe “one” product here is an information pr oduct and by “assembling” , the marketers mean\nwriting. The concept is actually good. Y ou can make $25,000.00 by writing one information\nproduct. I know of people who have made milli ons of dollars writing information products. In\nfact, in this book I have an enti re section dedicated to the bu siness of being an information\nmarketer.\nHowever, from reading the ad, you’d never know  that it had anything to do with writing\nand selling an info-product. The ad itself ma kes it seems as though you’ll assemble something,\none time, and get a check for $25,000. What it really means is that you write an info-product one time, sell it for at least $25, and sell 1,000 c opies. However, the ad does NOT mention the\nadditional time you’ll have to spend “assembling” a sales letter or ad to sell the product. Or the\nmoney you’ll have to spend placing ads or ma iling out direct mail letters. The opportunity\nmarketer took a proven business idea but added a “t wist” in his letter that  made it sound different\nthan anything else. And, in the opportunity mark et, something different creates curiosity and\ncash.\nHow to Make $15,000 a Day Mailing Dirt-Cheap Postcards\nThere are a lot of variations of the basic concep t, which is selling products or services by mailing\nout postcards. Often the product is a network marketing opportunity. Other times the product\nmight be mailing lists or home -business booklets. The idea is that you can start making money\nby simply addressing and mailing out inexpensiv e postcards while you sit at home, watching\nyour favorite TV shows. (Hey, this could be a nother way to “Get Paid While Watching Your\nFavorite TV Shows!”)  The problem is that postcards are good for gene rating leads and getting people to “raise their\nhand” for more information, but they are rarely  a good medium for making  direct sales. There\njust isn’t enough room on a sta ndard-sized postcard to make a sale. I have had some success\nmyself using postcards to generate leads and then mailing those leads a larger direct mail\npackage with an order form. Using that method, you can see some positive results. But again, this is regular ol’ mail or der marketing. As you’ve no doubt noticed by now, opportunity\nmarketers are great at taking a tried-and-true co ncept and putting a new twist on it that makes it\nsound completely different and unique.\nMake $17,500 a Month – Ma iling Two Simple Letters\nWhat are the two simple letters? The ad neve r tells you but promises to reveal the secret--\nINSIDE THE $25 book. Here’s the secr et: One letter is real ly a full-page ad that sells a money-\nmaking book for $10 to $15. The second letter is an  advertising placement form that you use to\nplace the ad in a money-making magazine. You mail the ad with your ad placement form (and\npayment) to the magazine; it runs the ad and you get orders. “$17,500 a month” as the ad states.\n(Actually, that number is VERY optimistic!)\nAgain, it’s plain ol’ mail order. My only probl em with this concept is that it recommends\nthat new entrepreneurs spend $2,500 to $5,000 to  run a full-page ad in a money-making\nmagazine selling a $10 to $25 book. At $10, you’d have to sell 250 to 500 of these books just to\nbreak even! And while these magazines do have large readerships, unless you have a hot product\n75 and a killer ad, I doubt you’ll be able to break even. In fact, mo st opportunity marketers use these\nlow-cost $10 to $25 products as “l oss leaders” that pull in buyers so they can sell them a large\n$250 to $500 back-end product.\nGet Paid for Reading Classified Ads in Your Local Newspaper\nThere are two main ways that th ese type of opportunities work. Fi rst, you have the real estate\ninvesting method. You’re supposed to read the daily newspaper and check the classifieds for\nmotivated sellers of homes in your local area. Then, you offer them creative financing deals\n(lease options, no money down, owner financing, etc.) to gain contro l of the property. That’s one\nmethod behind the “Get Paid for R eading Classified Ads” opportunity.\nA second version reveals that you should watch the “For sale” section of the classifieds\nand look for items (like TV’s, cars, exercise equi pment, etc.) that are grossly under priced. Often,\npeople just want to get rid of items around their home, so they’re willing to take next to nothing\nfor them. The plan is to keep your eyes peeled  for these types of deals. Then, you buy the item\nand turn it around and sell it for a slightly higher  price in the same cla ssified ad section. It\nfollows the basic concept of “Buy Low, Sell High” . Today, with the Internet, this method can be\neven more effective. You now have the abilit y to buy under priced items through the classified\nad section and sell them on the Internet, through site s like eBay. This can work well, but you\nneed a constant supply of under priced items (tha t are in demand online) to create a consistent\nincome.\nMake Real Money Shopping and Eati ng at Your Favorite Restaurants\nWhen an opportunity marketer stumbles onto a un ique way to make money, watch out! You’ll\nsoon see ads promoting it as a way that almost anyone can make money, when only a handful of\npeople are actually doing it. This particular  opportunity has to do with becoming a Mystery\nShopper.\nA mystery shopper is someone who is hire d (normally by a major corporation, or a\nmystery shopping agency) to shop at a store or eat at  a restaurant and secre tly review the store or\nrestaurant on their service. Companies use mystery shoppers because when someone from corporate headquarters arrives all employees are on their best beha vior. It’s impossible to gauge\nwhether or not the business is being run properly.  So a mystery shopper will play the part of a\ncustomer, buy something (or eat a meal)and then fill out a review form that gives corporate\nheadquarters an actual idea of how  customers are being treated.\nMystery shoppers are reimbursed for any money they spend shopping or eating at a\nrestaurant, and they’re paid an additional fee for each review they submit to headquarters.\nCurrently, in Dallas, there is an organization fo r agencies that hire a nd place mystery shoppers\ncalled the Mystery Shopping Providers Association.   If you’d like to find a mystery shopping agency in your local area, the best idea is to search the\nInternet. Within seconds of entering “Mystery Shopping Dallas” into Googl e’s search engine, I\nfound a company called Feedback Plus, which pays mystery shoppers to review area businesses.\n76 However, BE CAREFUL!  99% of the mystery shopping websites on the Internet are\nSELLING INFORMATION about mystery shoppi ng and are NOT actually going to give you\nmystery shopping assignments. Many of these e-books on Mystery Shopping contain old, worn-\nout information and dead links to websites that no longer exist. Some careful research on the\nInternet can pull up actual co mpanies that want to work with real mystery shoppers.\nNOTE:  Do NOT expect to make a full-tim e living as a mystery shopper. Often,\nmystery shoppers may do one or two a ssignments a week, being paid $20 to $50\nper assignment. At other times, a shopper may do one assignment a month or not\ndo any assignments for a longer period of time. Since it’s such an appealing way\nto make money (shopping and eating), the number of people vying for these\npositions is overwhelming. And with the deluge of e-books and reports on the\nInternet pointing people to  these mystery shopping companies, the competition is\nfierce. If you’d like to make an extr a $25 to $50 bucks a week and being a\nmystery shopper sounds fun, do some extra research and see if this sounds right\nfor you. Just don’t go into this field w ith unrealistic inco me expectations.\nHow to Pocket Huge Profits with Ordinary Tap Water\nIf you’ve seen the Wizard of Oz, you know that  the “Great and Might y Oz” that ruled the\nEmerald City was merely Professor Marvel behind a curtain. Once Toto pulled back the curtain,\nthe illusion of the “Great and Mighty O z” was gone and only the reality remained.\nI’ve been buying money-making opportunities fo r almost 20 years, and I’ve seen just\nabout everything. This opportunity is one that ma de the light bulb go off over my head. I realized\nthat the opportunity pub lishers RARELY if ever find a r eal breakthrough way to make money.\nInstead, they take something that is already wo rking for someone else, whether it’s mail order,\nreal estate, the Internet, tax liens , buying & selling, etc. and they give it a little different spin or\ntwist to make it look different. After seeing this opportunity ad, I was quick ly able to see other\nads and figure out (without even buying the syst em), the trick-- the actual money-making system\nthey are talking about. Today, my mind automati cally works that way. Even when the actual\nsystem isn’t revealed, I can normally think thr ough their wording and decipher the secret behind\ntheir system.\nThis one was tricky. After all, HOW can you make HUGE PROFITS with tap water? The\nad explains that you go to almost any sink, fill a gl ass with tap water, and shortly after, you leave\nwith a check for hundreds of dollars. And you can  do this over and over again, each time you fill\na glass with tap water, you pocket a few hundred  dollars in cash. Sounds like magic, right?\nIt’s not. Basically, you go to someone’s house,  fill up a glass of water from their faucet,\nand pitch them on the BENEFITS OF B UYING A WATER PURIFICA TION SYSTEM from\nyou. You show them how dirty their water is. Yo u have them do a taste test and compare the\ntaste of two glasses of water-- their unfiltered tap water and filtered water. You explain the\ndangers of lead in the water. You talk about bact eria and pull out charts w ith examples of deaths\ndue to bacterial infections. You pitch them on your water purifica tion system,  close them hard,\nand if you did a good job, you sell them an expe nsive water purificati on with a high-profit\nmargin (of which, you pocket 50% to 75% or more).\n77\nDo you see what I mean? The ad only gives you 10% of the overall story. If it explained\nthat you’d have to go door-to-door, selling high- priced water purification systems, you might not\nbe interested. However, by pitching this as a way to “Make Money from Tap water”, it sounds\nmagical. None of the actual work is explained. You’re led to believe that you simply fill up a\nglass with water, do something th at’ll be explained in the syst em they’re selling for $25 bucks,\nand you walk away with cash. But like many get -rich-quick plans, you buy the booklet for $25\nbucks, believe the “Wizard of Oz” is real, and when you get it, you realize that the man behind\nthe curtain has duped you.\nOne lesson to take away from this, especially  when you’re presented with a “blind offer”\n(Meaning: An offer where the actual system that creates the money is NOT revealed), is try to\nthink through what the actual method could be . Training yourself to see past the hype and\nunderstand what they’re selling BEFORE you inve st your money is a great way to keep your\nmoney in your wallet, instead of donating it to  a multi-million dollar opportunity marketer.\nHow to Make Money Helping Othe rs Get a Major Credit Card\nThis opportunity gives you the ability to sell people a list of companies that offer secured credit\ncards. A secured credit card is a card that is normally “secured” by a savings account. This way,\neven if the person applying for the card has bad cr edit, the company issuing the card feels secure\nin issuing it, because their credit limit is back ed by actual cash. If the person can’t repay their\nbalance, it’s paid out of the secured account.\nOnline, you can also promote credit cards (both secured and unsecured) and get a\ncommission each time someone signs up for a cr edit card through your link. One smart Internet\nmarketer, Joe Lloyd, has created a program that can  automatically create a ready-to-go website\nwith multiple credit card offers. You simply prom ote the site and when people visit, they can\nbrowse through your credit card offers and choose the one that’s right for them. When they do,\nyou get paid a commission. Complete details  are available at www.creditriches.com\nHow to Fatten Your Wallet in No Time Flat\nOne of my favorite money-making books of all tim e is this book, written by a marketer named\nLawrence Tabak. This silver book, roughly 131 page s, reveals how he made a bunch of money\nselling products by mail. It’s basically a st arter course for anyone who wants to make good\nmoney in direct response marketing. However, it’ s a great read, because Mr. Tabak is a very\nentertaining writer and really te lls you the secrets behind writi ng sizzling hot copy, finding great\nmarkets, locating products, and building a large direct marketing business. The book was very\nlow-cost, and from the pile of testimonials on the marketing piece he mailed out, I’m guessing he sold thousands of copies.\nThe back of his manual contains a special offe r to join his Inner Circle Club and get his\npersonal coaching for $1,950. And I’m sure that a good portion of the people who purchased his\nbooklet invested in his coaching program. I ha ve no doubt that Mr. Tabak used the marketing\nadvice he gave throughout his book and created a million dollar fortune selling the book and his\ncoaching program.\n78 Today, Mr. Tabak runs a vitamin company on the Internet. He’s retired from the\nopportunity market – and no longer sells his book, How to Fatten Your Wallet in No Time Flat. I\ncontacted him once to try and get the rights to re-publish it, but to no avail. Sometimes used\nversions are available through Amazon.com  for between $9 and $12. I highly recommend\nchecking to see if you can get a copy. Very highly recommended.\nMake up to $9,600 in 24 Hours or Less\nThese types of blind ads never tell you what you’ll be doing. The opportunity marketers that\nwrite and publish these info-produc ts rely on their stories of “rag s to riches”. I’m sure you’ve\nheard them over and over again. “I was broke, I lo st my home, I was eating the last box of Wheat\nThins on the corner in the rain when I had an  idea! Within days, I made $50,000. Today, I own\nan island, a jet plane, and a small country in  Europe!” And for only $25 bucks, you can discover\nwhat my amazing idea is.\nThis system is no different from any other. You’re supposed to be impressed that you can\nmake a large sum of money very quickly. Other ads claim the same thing, just with different\ndollar amounts. And honestly, the dollar amounts don’t matter that much. As long as they’re\nimpressive and the statement “in 24 Hours or Less” accompanies them, it captures the reader’s\nattention.\nSo how DO you make this type of money in 24 hours or less? Well, let’s remember that\nthe opportunity marketer doesn’t tell you the enti re story. So let’s say, for example, that you\nspend 20 years of your life searching for valu able antiques. You find some good deals, but\nnothing spectacular. Then, one day, you stumble into  an antique store – and discover a painting\nyou know is easily worth $15,000.00 selling for just  $15 bucks! You quickly buy it, drive across\ntown to another antique store and sell it to them for $12,500 cash! You just made $12,500 in less\nthan 24 hours! However, the “real story” is that you have 20 years of experience. You’ve been in\nand out of every antique store from here to Timbuktu. You’ve read books on antiques, you’ve\nbeen to hundreds of auctions, and you have a wea lth of experience. So you could say, in this one\nsituation, you did make $12,500 in less than 24 hour s BUT that ignores what it took for you to\nget to this “24-hour wi ndow of opportunity”.\nIt’s the same way with my business. A fe w years ago, I had an amazing offer that was\nselling like hotcakes. It had a $997 price tag and on some days, I mi ght sell 20 or 30 of these. I\nhonestly had days where I made $30,000.00 in ONE  DAY! So I guess I could write a booklet\nthat told you “How to Make $30,000.00 In 24 Hour s or Less” but a good po rtion of it would\nhave to explain to you that it took me years to get a good feel for my market, start and build my\nbusiness, develop my copywriting skills, and ju st keep at it until I found this opportunity.\nSo what the actual opportunity is in this par ticular instance doesn’t matter as much as the\nlesson I hope you take from it. The secret behind this opportunity is real estate. And mail order\nmarketing. And information marketing. And Intern et marketing. Because ALL of these methods\ncan give you BIG PAYDAYS of $10,000 or more in  just one 24-hour period. However, there’s a\nlot of time, effort, and energy that goes into creating those big paydays. It’s not instantaneous,\neven though the opportunity market ers make it appear that way.\n79 Turn a 30-Minute Sunday Dr ive into $10,000 or More\nThe secret behind this opportunity has to do wi th investing in real estate. Every Sunday, you\ndrive around your local area and look for propert y in which to invest. Whenever you make an\noffer and close a deal, you can pocket up to $10,000 or  more in profits. Again, it’s simply real\nestate investing with a twist. Do you notice the trend now? The secr et is to tie into something\nthat seems easy-- stuffing envelopes, filling up a glass with tap water, compiling names, assembling products, or taking a lazy Sunda y drive-- and making HUGE PROFITS and BIG\nMONEY! But underneath the hype is a real busine ss that takes an investment of time, energy,\nand money to start and be successful.\n$985 a Day Receiving Phone Calls –\nand You Never Have to Talk to Anyone\nThis money-making system was the first opportun ity created and sold by opportunity marketing\nmulti-millionaire, T.J. Rohleder. The actual sy stem was entitled “Dialing for Dollars” and it\nreally was an ingenious way to make money.\nHere’s how it worked:\nT.J.’s company, Mid-American Opportunity Research\nEnterprises (M.O.R.E. Inc., for short), offered you a distributorship for a wide variety of money-\nmaking booklets. You were to place small classi fied ads in your local newspaper (or any\nnewspaper around the country) that would genera te interest in the book you chose to sell.\nHowever, here’s where the telephone call “twi st” comes in. In your ad, you include a phone\nnumber for people to call for more informa tion. The phone number rings into your answering\nmachine – which gives full details about your bookl et and asks the caller to leave their name,\naddress, and phone number... and the booklet will be shipped to them by C.O.D. (Cash On Delivery).\nThe method is very creative, because it gives people the opportunity to start small, with\ninexpensive newspaper ads, and use new tec hnology at the time (answering machines) to do\n100% of the selling and capturi ng the buyer’s information. The ad s and the answering machine\ndid 100% of the marketing work and the pers on running the business simply spent a few hours\neach day taking names off of the answering machine and shipping out the booklets by C.O.D.\nToday, people are using voice mail instead of  answering machines for selling info-\nproducts from small classified ads. One of the benefits is that your voi cemail system can often\ntake multiple calls at once, instead of the “one-call-only” answering machine. It’s still a very viable concept and one that really worked for a lot of people.\n80 4\nSecrets of the Opportunity Market\nThe business opportunity market is huge. It in cludes all of the companies selling money-\nmaking booklets in the business opportunity magazines (like M oney-Making Opportunities, Get\nRich at Home, and Entrepreneur), the thousands  of money-making websites online, late-night\ninfomercials that promise you “instant real esta te riches” and “money in your mailbox”, and even\nthe traveling “workshops” that visit large cities , hawking various wealth-building systems.\nThe demand for information on how to make mo re money is so large that thousands of\ncompanies are making millions of dollars a year just trying to k eep up with the demand. In fact,\nsome people are making up to (and over) $1 million dollars a month selling this wealth-building information.\nBecause of this huge demand, there are some schemers and con artists who take\nadvantage of people who are looking for wealth. B ecause they’re more interested in getting rich\nthan helping others, they have no problem fabrica ting lies and telling people what they want to\nhear. These companies often rake in a large amo unt of money selling worthless information and\nthen disappear into thin air before customers can get their money back. Then, a few weeks or\nmonths later, they start over again with a diffe rent name and a different product. Fortunately, the\nFTC keeps an eye open for these types of scam artis ts, but even their diligent efforts can’t rid the\nbusiness opportunity marketplace of everyone who wants to make a fast buck taking advantage\nof people’s dreams.\nOn the other hand, there are also very  good, honest, hard-working people in the\nopportunity market who really ar e trying to help their clients and customers make money. I’m\nproud to say I’m one of those people. Because of my background, living hand-to-mouth in a beat-up mobile home (with a family of mice) in a dirty, run-down trailer park in the middle of\nNowhere, Kansas, my mission in life is to make sure the people who want out of their present\ncircumstances have the information and help necessary to achieve their dreams. I understand\nwhat it’s like to feel like you have untapped pot ential. I understand what it feels like to believe\nthat if you only had the right system, the right information, you could become a millionaire. So\nI’ve dedicated my life to providing the best financial freedom information to those who want it.\nFortunately, there are a lot of  people just like me. And they deliver great, high-quality\ninformation on how to truly make a lot of money. Whether it’s in real estate, mail order, the\nInternet, or starting your own home-based bus iness, they’re “good guys and gals” focus on\nhelping their clients break free of their money wo rries and move toward true financial freedom.\nIn this section, I’m going to re veal some of the techniques us ed by the shadier side of the\nopportunity market. I want to help you avoid be ing taken advantage of. I’ve talked to too many\npeople who have gone into serious debt, up to  $90,000.00 and more, buying worthless “get-rich-\n81 quick” junk from con artists. Please read this se ction carefully. It has th e potential to save you\nthousands of dollars a year in money wast ed on money-making systems that don’t work.\nThe Blind Ad\nA “Blind Ad” is any advertisement (magazine ad, sales letter, website) that doesn’t tell\nyou what the system is behind the money-maki ng program. An opportunity publisher leaves out\nthe actual “secret”, because-- in most cases -- the method for making money takes work and\neffort, which often turns off the business opportunity buyer.   Instead, the ad tells a story of how the oppor tunity marketer was down on his luck, broke,\nand struggling to get by. Then, of ten through a lucky twist of fate , the marketer found a get-rich\nmethod. Maybe he stumbled onto a dusty book in a us ed bookstore. Or maybe he sat next to an\nelderly gentleman on a park bench that turned out  to be a millionaire. Once the get-rich method\nwas discovered, the marketer had an almost mi raculous turnaround, going from broke to super-\nwealthy, with a mansion, exotic cars, and taking luxury vacations.\nThe story of this amazing reversal is e nough to capture the imagin ation (and wallet) of\nthe reader. If the story captures th e attention and imagination of the reader, he or she rarely needs\nadditional facts or figures to decide to purchase.   If any details are given about the actual  money-making method, they’re normally vague\nand often very simple. Some phras es used in blind ads include...\n• Do everything while you sit in front of your TV.\n• Do it from your favorite easy chair in your spare time.\n• Make money in as little as 15 to 30 minutes a day or less.\n• All you do is fill out one simple form. That’s it!\n• Just do ONE SIMPLE STEP and you can get paid for life!\n• Just go to your mailbox and pull out checks!\nOften, the reader is told what the opportunity  IS NOT, instead of what it is. For example,\nmany money-making ads and sales letters try to keep you from guessing what the opportunity is\n(without actually telling you what it is) by saying...\nThis isn’t like anything yo u’ve ever seen before. It’s...\nN O T  M L M      NOT Mail Order     NOT Real Estate     NOT Internet Marketing     NOT Import/Export     NOT Online Auctions     NOT Personal Selling    It’s 100% completely different!\n82\nOften, you’re fed excuses as to why they can ’t reveal the actual method in the marketing\npiece. They only want to let a few people know a bout it. They only have time to work with a\nsmall number of people. They don’t want to let the cat out of the bag. They want to help only\nthose people willing to take action. Whatever the reason, it always sounds believable. But\nnormally, the reason is that if they did tell you wh at it took to really make money with their get-\nrich method, you wouldn’t be interest ed. At least, that’s what they  believe. So they promote it by\nusing their own success story (if it’s actually re al), photocopied bank statements, and a statement\nfrom their accountant. That’s enough to hope fully get people to buy. And often, people do buy.\nIn droves.\nFake Testimonials\nIt’s illegal to make up testimonials for a product-- very i llegal. However, that doesn’t stop\nopportunity marketers from doing it. I’m certa inly NOT suggesting that many opportunity\nmarketers do it. In fact, only those who are on th e fringes of the business opportunity market take\nthe risk of going to prison by creating testim onials and success storie s out of thin air.\nHowever, it does happen and you should be  aware that it does happen. Often, people\ndecide to purchase a money- making opportunity NOT on the basi s of the actual opportunity, but\nbased on the success stories and testimonials of people who have used the opportunity to get\nrich.   There’s one very well known case where an opportunity marketer made up testimonials\nand went to prison for a very long time.\nWilliam J. McCorkle sold a real estate course  through a late-night TV infomercial. In his\ninfomercial, he showed his luxur ious lifestyle-- complete with stretch limousines, helicopters,\nand planes. He also trotted out one “Success Story” after anothe r who supposedly got rich using\nhis wealth-building methods.   In reality, these “Success Stories” were fr iends of Mr. McCorkle, as well as actors and\nactresses paid to give fake testimonials for his infomercial. These people hadn’t made one dime\nwith his system, yet their stories motivated thousa nds of people to dig into their pockets and pay\nfor Mr. McCorkle’s system.   Long story short, Mr. McCorkle was charged with numerous crimes (some for the fake\ntestimonials, others for money laundering a nd conspiracy). On November 4th, 1998 William\nMcCorkle was found guilty of 82 counts of fraud and money laundering. In January 1999, he and his wife were both sentenced to 24 years in  prison, where they remain to this day.\nWilliam McCorkle ran a multi-million dollar business opportunity company and most people believed his testimonials were true. Th ey weren’t. Don’t purchase a money-making\nopportunity based solely on testim onials. Do your research and make sure the opportunity is\nsolid before investing.\n83 Conditional Guarantees\nWhile I don’t see these as often today as I did back in the late 1980’s, conditional\nguarantees do pop up once in a while.   Basically, a conditional guarantee states that you can get a refund of  your investment, IF\nyou meet certain conditions.   Opportunity marketers use conditional guarant ees to make sure their buyers do NOT get\na refund. Or, at the very least, to make sure that their buyers must jump through multiple hoops\nbefore they get a refund.   A common conditional guarantee is that you must prove th at you used the opportunity\nbefore you can get a refund. For example, one m oney-making system I purchased revealed that\nyou needed to place a full-page ad in a magazine  before you could get a $25 refund. Since a full-\npage ad cost $2,000 at the time, it made no sense for someone not interested in the money-making method to spend $2,000 to get back $25. Th at’s another reason why some opportunity\nmarketers sell their methods “blind”. A marketer  selling a business oppor tunity blind, with a\nconditional guarantee, has you trapped if you discover the money-making method isn’t\nsomething you want to do. You couldn’t tell that from the original ad and by the time you know\nthe method, the only way to get your money back is  to actually try the method. It’s a catch-22\nsituation.   As I stated before, while many opportunity  marketers no longer use these conditional\nguarantees, keep your eyes peeled for th em. They’re usually worded like this:\n“Plus, I fully guarantee your entire purcha se-- so there is no risk to you. Simply\ntry my system for 30 days and if you don’t make at least $10,000.00, simply send it back for a full and complete refund, no questions asked.”\nThe “catch” here is that the guarantee says  you have to “try the system for 30 days,”\nwhich may involve spending hundreds or thousa nds of dollars. And, with these types of\nconditional guarantees, you never know exactly what  the marketer means by “trying the system”\nuntil you get the system in the mail and they’ve laid  out the 18 things you have to do before you\ncan ask for a refund.\nThe Magic Pill\nOpportunity marketer s all know that human beings re spond to messages of convenience\nand ease. We don’t want to exert a lot of hard, ba ck-breaking effort. We d on’t want to spend our\nlives working. We don’t want to go to bed late, d ead tired, only to drag  ourselves out of bed\nbefore the crack of dawn, to toil for another day. We want things quick, easy, and right now.\nOpportunity marketers feed this natural tendency by selli ng us what I and other marketers\ncall, “The Magic Pill”. For example, if you ha d to make a choice between losing weight by\n84 exercising hard 2 hours a day, 7 days a week, an d eating only salads OR by taking a “Magic\nPill”, which would you prefer? The pill, right?   How about making money? Want to try to star t a business, rent an office, hire employees,\nand deal with the constant headaches and ha ssles of running your own company? Or would you\nrather be able to get rich by swallowing a “Magic Pill”?   The magic pill always wins out. Of course , opportunity marketers don’t really sell a\nmagic pill, but they try to sell you the next best  thing. Any method they can sell you, that takes\nlittle or no work, little or no money, and little or no effort, is like a magic pill.\nTurnkey websites are like a “magic pill”. The website is ready to go. Professionally\ndesigned. Proven products. Website hosting incl uded. The company selling the website will\nstock, process, and ship all orders. 99% of th e “work” is done for you. ALL you have to do is\nsimply advertise it. And that only takes as little  as 15 to 30 minutes a day in your spare time. You\ncan even place ads while sitting in front  of your TV, watching your favorite shows.\nIt’s a “Magic Pill”. Get rich by just pl acing a few ads and we’ll do everything else to\nmake you rich. It’s a big promise in easy-to-swallow “pill” form.   The “Magic Pill” can come in many different forms:\n• Ready-to-go website, sales letter, ads\n• Drop shipping of products to your cust omers. No stocking of inventory.\n• Printing and mailing marketing materials for you\n• Mailing marketing materials to  mailing lists on your behalf\n• Closing leads by telephone and giving you commissions\nAnything that takes what might ordi narily be a more energy-intensi ve activity and turns it into an\n“already-done-for-you” system is known as a “Magic Pill”.\nHonestly, I like the concept of th e magic pill. In some instances, it  really can work. For example,\nyou can look at affiliate programs as a “Magic  Pill” way of making money. You simply refer\npeople to companies through your affiliate link a nd you can get paid for any sales made, even\nthough the companies do all of the work of stocking, processing, and filling orders.\nHowever, some companies take the “Magic Pill”  idea a bit far or use it simply to capture\npeople who either don’t have any time to start a nd build their own business or who simply don’t\nwant to start their own business, but still want the financial bene fits that come from owning one.\nWhile some companies do offer some services that fall into this “Magic Pill” category,\nthey also have parts of the business that you must do. Other companies, though, may try to\nconvince you that they do 100% of the work a nd you do absolutely nothing. Let’s get real. If you\ndo nothing and the company does 100% of the work, why would they pay you a dime? These\nsystems are often illegal and can end up getting th e people selling them into trouble. In fact, I\nknow of one guy who ran a very large multi-million dollar corporation that promised his clients\n85 that he would “Do Everything For You”. All hi s clients had to do was write him a check and\nhe’d print the sales letters, mailing them to lists, fulfill orders, and send out commission checks.  Well, without going into too much detail, I he ard recently that he settled a plea deal with\nthe government – and went to prison for quite a few years.\nWatch out for these “Magic Pi ll” deals that seem too good to  be true. Too often, they\nreally are.\nIn Conclusion...\nThe opportunity market, like any market, has its share of companies who try to take\nadvantage of people. Unfortunately, these comp anies make the high-quality companies look bad.\nTo keep from being ripped off, be cautious  when purchasing money-making programs – and do\nyour research first. A little bit of research can save you a lot of money and headaches later on.\nCheck out the company online through Google. com or any other major search engine. If\nyou have questions about the opportunity that aren’t  answered in the marketing materials, feel\nfree to call or write for more information. If you don’t get an answer you’re satisfied with, it’s a\ngood bet that you won’t be happy once you’ve purchased their opportunity either.\nAnd don’t worry about those “Limited Bonuses ” or “You Must Order Within 24 Hours”\noffers. Most companies will accept your money at any time. So take your time to investigate and\nresearch. If it’s a good opportunity today, it’ll be  a good opportunity next week or next month as\nwell.\n86 5\nHow to Spot a Scam\nSo how do you spot a scam?  Well, it’s not always easy.  Many scam artists have gotten\nquite good at what they do (unfortunately) and th us many of their pitche s sound very sincere and\ngenuine.\nGeneral “Opportunities” to avoid (because they may be scams):\nAnything that doesn’t specify what  you’ll be doing.  Think about it\n: if what you’ll be\ndoing is really fun, exciting, and fulfilling, wouldn’t  they want to tell you all about it right up-\nfront?  If they’re not saying what  it is, it’s probably illegal, unfulf illing, or it just plain doesn’t\nexist. Many of the sales letters offering these types of scams tell you what the opportunity is\nNOT. For example , it’s NOT MLM, Mail Order, or Real Estate Investing . But they never tell you\nwhat it IS . Be careful if you’re asked to put money down for an opportunity that doesn’t tell you\nexactly how you’ll be making money.\nAnything that requires you to pay a good chunk of cash (at least several hundred dollars)\nup-front with little explanation of  why this is necessary other than a vague claim that it’s for\nsome type of supplies or a kit. You always want  to know exactly what you’re getting into before\ninvesting. If it isn’t clear a nd the company won’t answer your  questions, steer clear. Good,\nstrong companies who want you to succeed will te ll you exactly what you’re getting into – and\nwhat your money is going for.\nAny opportunity where you can’t contact the company, either by phone, fax, or email, is\nprobably not a good opportunity to join. After all,  once you invest in their opportunity, how are\nyou supposed to get your questions answered? Stay away from companies that are happy to take\nyour money, but not eager to answer your questions.\nMany of these con artists focus on getting you excited through earning potential, success\nstories and testimonials of other people making money (which could be completely made up),\nand promises of easy money with little or no work.  They hold back on giving you any real\ninformation and just flash a bunch of money in  front of you, tell you some “success stories”\nabout made-up people who made insane amounts of money, and stress that those people are just\nlike you.\nWhat they’re trying to do is get your greed glands going and whip you into an\nenthusiastic frenzy so that you’re predisposed to  buy whatever it is they’r e selling, regardless of\nhow sleazy the company is or what they’re having you do.  I know... It’s shameless, but it happens.\n87 Now let’s be really honest here. I have  greed glands. I’m guessing you do too. We’re\nhuman beings. Without these greed  glands, you wouldn’t be motivat ed to start your own business\nand reach financial freedom. Wanting money isn’t particularly a bad thing. However, con artists\ncan use that desire for financ ial freedom against you. And the wo rse if you want (or even need)\nadditional money, the easier it is for the con ar tists to prey on you. When your desire is high, you\nmay tend to ignore the warning signs, tell yourself  “what if this really works like they say it\nwill”, and... WHAMMO ... you’re hooked.\nThis has happened to me more than once.  Bu t I don’t beat myself up about it. I just learn\nfrom it and move on. So if you do get hooked and ripped off, don’t let that stop you. Simply pick yourself up, dust yourself off, and learn from the experience.\nSo what do scams look like?  It’s difficult to say, since they’re all different.  However,\nthere are a few hallmarks they have in common.  Think of these as distin guishing characteristics.\nCommon Characteristics of Scams\n• Offering you a work-at-home “job”  – where you’re supposedly pa id a salary or hourly\nwage from a company while “working from home”. While some companies do offer “tele-\ncommuting”, most of these companies don’t adve rtise that fact through home-business books\nor directories. Be very careful when you s ee a book or directory promising work-at-home\n“jobs” or “employment”.\n• “Home Assembly” offers  – where you’ll be paid for assemb ling crafts or gifts in your spare\ntime with materials supplied fo r you. Many of these home assembly offers charge you a fee\nto start and then refuse to pay you for th e items you’ve assembled. The company makes\nmoney selling you their $30 to $40 start-up kits.\n• Envelope stuffing or coupon clipping.  These “opportunities” are made to sound like you\ncan pocket huge sums of money doing something incredibly simple. After all, most people\ncan “clip a coupon” or “stuff an envelope”. Howe ver, there is always a “catch” that isn’t\nexplained in the ad. You end up paying $30 or so for a “system” that is unworkable or\nincludes a lot more work than just stuffing envelopes or clipping coupons.\n• Guaranteed income (“You’ ll make $60,000/month—GUARANTEED!”)  No company\ncan guarantee how much money you’ll make, b ecause no one can control how much work\nyou’ll do or what actions you’ll take. However, most people are looking for some sort of\nguarantee, so these types of offers are very appealing.\n• Products that “sell themselves”  (so why doesn’t the company just put the product out on\ntheir front lawn with a salesman to take or ders from people who walk by?) No products sell\nthemselves. Other “lures” are products or serv ices that “everyone needs” or “everyone will\nwant.” That’s rare. And even with these types of  products, they still have to be marketed. The\n“everyone will want that” pitch makes it sound like you can make money with virtually no\nwork. It just isn’t the case.\n88 • Pressure to make a decision or co mmit right now or on the spot.  If an opportunity is a\ngood opportunity, it’ll be around tomorrow, next w eek, and next month. Don’t be pushed into\nan opportunity because “time is running out.” If it’s a good decision today, it’ll be a good\ndecision next month, too.\n• Income earnings that sound too good to be true.   Do people make large sums of money?\nYou bet! During one of my best months in bus iness, I generated over $200,000 in gross sales.\nHowever, that was after many years of trial and error and lots of effo rt. So be careful if\nsomeone promises you huge sums of money in a very short period of time. And the bigger\nthe amount, the more skeptical you’ll need to be.\n• You are discouraged from taking time to rea d a contract or let an attorney review it\n(scam artists are like vampires—they function be st in the dark). If you have to sign a legal\ndocument to join a business opportunity, always – without exception – have an experienced\nattorney review it for you.\n• They give you all sorts of excuses when you ask to speak with other investors or\nprevious investors.  A good company that delivers a high-quality opportunity that works will\nwant you to contact their other investors or dealers. Be wary  of any company that either\nwon’t let you contact their dealers or can’t give you a good reason why they won’t.\n• No one ever answers the phone  and the company address is a P.O. Box. Many fly-by-night\ncompanies set up shop through a post office box or mail drop service.\n• You’re given testimonials with initials only.  One problem with spotting scams is that con\nartists are willing to lie through th eir teeth to get your money. Th is means that they might be\nwilling to make up testimonials for their opportun ity, which is totally illegal. However, if\nthey don’t have testimonials or the testimonial s have only initials, then be cautious. Good\ntestimonials give the customer’s first and last name plus their city and state.\n• You get that sick feeling in the pit of your stomach  that something about this whole deal\nfeels wrong somehow. Yes, your intuition is nor mally right. It’s happened to me a time or\ntwo. One part of me wants to jump on the ba ndwagon but there’s a gn awing feeling inside\nmy gut that tells me to “stay away” from th e opportunity. In almost all cases, the gnawing\nfeeling in my gut was right. If you’re not cert ain about an opportunity, there’s no harm in\navoiding it. Again, if it’s a good decision toda y, it’ll be a good d ecision tomorrow after\nyou’ve done more research.\n• You get the feeling that the co mpany is most interested in  selling you the opportunity or\nfranchise and not in adding a quality person to their company.\n• Claims you’ll make a lot for doing very little , or that you won’t have to sell anything.\nI’m guessing that most people would like “m oney for nothing,” like winning the lottery.\nWell, the con artists know this so they ma ke their opportunity sound as “hands-off” as\npossible. You do little or no work. You don’t do any selling. You don’t talk to anyone. You\ndon’t lift a finger. You do nothing and the mone y comes rolling in. My friend, if there was\n89 such a business, I guarantee the millionaire entrepreneurs would know about it first and\nthey’d all be doing it instead of doing what they’re doing now (building strong businesses\nwith long-term income).\n• You have to buy a lot of costly inventory.  I personally believe th at you don’t want to get\ninto any opportunity that demands that you buy a bunch of inventory before you’ve had a\nchance to promote the product. Normally, in thes e situations, you end up with a garage full of\nlotions, potions, or other such stuff you can’t sell and the company that sold it to you is\ngetting rich. NOT through the sales of the products, but by forcing their dealers to buy\ninventory up-front.\n• There’s no agreement to buy back any of your unsold inventory  (if it’s such hot stuff and\nit will sell so easily, why won’t they buy it b ack?) Again, I wouldn’t get involved with a\ncompany that requires that you purchase a lot of  inventory right off the bat. But if you do,\nthey should have some sort of “buy back” agreement. If not, that’s a warning sign.\n• Fake or Misleading Guarantees.  For example, if the guarantee says , “Give our system a\ntry... and if, after trying it, it doesn’t ma ke you $100,000 in cash, simply send it back and\nwe’ll refund every penny you paid, no questions asked” . Sounds okay, right? Actually, the\nguarantee states that you have to try their sy stem before you can get a refund. And, if they\nhaven’t told you what the system is before you purchase it, you might fi nd that trying their\nsystem is more costly than the price of the system you’re  buying. For example, one time I\nbought a system that taught me how to make money running full-page ads in magazines to\ngenerate sales. The only way I could get a ref und on the $40 system was if I sent them a copy\nof the magazine with the full-page ad in it.  That ad would have cost me $4,000. So to get\nback my $40, I would have had to spend $4,000! Plus, by the time my ad would have run, the\ncompany was already out of business and had mo ved onto some other post office box to start\nthis scam all over again.\n90 6\nBonus Chapter A\nHow to Create a $1,000,000\nA Year Income Stream!\nWritten by Mr. X & Reprinted with Permission\n(Editor’s Note:  This bonus chapter came from the notes for an\nunpublished book written by a business opportunity marketer who\nhas made millions of dollars selling money-making information.\nI’ve included this chapter to give you a look “behind-the-scenes” at the formula used by business opportunity marketers to create their vast fortunes.)\nOnly 1 person in 10,000 knows anything at all about the opportunity market.\nThis is a small marketplace of:\nA. People who are actively looking for met hods, plans, and programs to make\nmoney.\nB. Companies who are in the business of pr oviding a wide range of products and\nservices to fill thos e needs and desires.\nAlmost everybody says they would like to earn extra money, but very few people ever\ninvest a dime on any type of information on how th ey can actually do it.  This never made sense\nto me, until I began to realize that what people say and do are two different things.  People only\ndo the things that most interest them .\nThis brings me to a very important poi nt – you can tell a lot about any person you\nwant to know about by simply looking ar ound at what they are spending their\nmoney on.  The first time I heard somebody say this I thought little of it.  But then\nI began looking around at people I knew we ll and saw this prin ciple in action.\nYou will, too!\nThere are about 3,000,000 people across the country who, at any given time, are\nactively looking for ways to make money.  These people initially respond to some type of\nadvertisement and get on somebody’s money-making or business opportunity mailing list.  Then their name is traded, bought, or rented to othe r individuals and companies who are involved in\nselling similar types of money- making information or programs.\nI am 100% sure this ha s been your experience\n.  Somehow, you initia lly inquired or sent\naway for some type of money-making plan.  This contact got your name placed on somebody’s\n91 mailing list, and soon, before you knew it, other sim ilar types of offers began showing up in your\nmailbox from individuals and companies you never heard of! Some of the offers really sounded\ngood, and you sent for them, which kept your name circulating on various mailing lists!\nNow you know the secret!  This is how you ended up becoming a customer of ours, and\nis the same thing that is happening to thousa nds of people just like you every single year!\nNow it is time for you to get on the other side of the cash register!\nInstead of getting\nthese constant solicitations for money-maki ng plans, methods, reports, and opportunities.\nIt Is Time for you to Develop One of Your Own,\nAnd Make $1,000,000 or Mo re Every Single Year!\nThis is how my wife and I got our start.  Our names were on all the mailing lists (or so it seemed), and we were constantly bombarded with  all kinds of solicitations from companies we\nhad never heard of who were promis ing to show us how to get rich!\nSoon we discovered (as you probably ha ve) that many of these money-making\ninformational products on the market are complete trash\n!  This made us angry, but also made us\nrealize that we could probably create a good business by researching and developing money-\nmaking plans that work .  This is what we did and ended up making millions of dollars in the\nprocess!  Now we want to show you how you can do it too !\nOur $1,000,000-a-year plan is quite simple and is based on these principles:\nA. Hundreds of thousands of people in this  country are looking for money-making\nopportunities that really work.\nB. These people can be reached through all kinds of mailing lists, magazines, and\nother media.\nC. The majority of these people have be en let down by many companies in the\nmarketplace who are selling worthless mone y-making plans.  This disappointment\nleaves them with their initi al desires as strong as ever , but frustrated by the many\noffers they receive in the mail or see in  the magazines that they do not trust.\nD. This is the set of circumstances that  sets the stage for you to make $1,000,000 a\nyear or more!\nAll you have to do is create and develop money-making plans that are of the highest\nquality.   Develop plans that really work , and you will win the trust of these people and their\nrepeat business. Get enough of these people to do business with you, win their trust by\nconverting them into repeat buyers, and you can get rich! This is how it happened to my wife and\nme, and can work for you, too.\nIt took us a long time to learn how to de velop and produce quality money-making plans\nand programs.  It was a gradual process in which we are still learning and expanding our\nknowledge.\n92 We have made millions of dollars doing this , and sincerely wanted to show you how to\ndo it too.  But, the burning question was, COULD WE TEACH YOU HOW TO MAKE\nMILLIONS DOING THE SAME THING WE HAVE DONE?\nThe answer is YES !  Here is our simple 7-step formula  you can follow and build a\nbusiness that brings in more money in one da y than most people make in an entire year!\nStep 1\nBecome familiar with the money- making plans and programs\nthat are on the market and th e companies selling them.\nThis is an easy and logical first step to ta ke because it shows you the items that are selling\nfor others.  You should send away for as many different things as you can afford.\nThis step will do two things :\n1) Give you a great idea of what type s of opportunity offers are on the\nmarket now and\n2) The realization that many of th e companies are selling junk, and you\ncould do a much better j ob than they are doing.\nYou will build a lot of confid ence by realizing that you coul d do a better job than the\ncompanies you bought from!  The secret is to examine these plans like you would as a\ncompetitor rather than a consumer .  Try to see how easy it must have been to put something\nlike this together.\nThinking like a competitor simply takes a di fferent mindset.  You must pick the product\nor company apart and try to determine things th at most people never begin to ask themselves.\nYou must not only dissect it, but you must ask yourself how you can do it better !\nYou will be shocked by the amount of sales material you can get by spending one evening sending away for “free information” from  all of the companies a dvertising in the money-\nmaking magazines or in the back of Popular Mechanics , or the supermarket tabloids.\nIt will not stop there.  Pretty soon your name will be traded, sold, and rented to other opportunity sellers, and you will get a ton of new sales packages  that you never sent away for!  A\nconsumer would call this junk mail , but a competitor calls it RESEARCH MATERIAL!\nSee where a little difference in your mindset can make you a lot of money?\nStep 2\nCopy from the very best plan or program you can find!\n93  There is no faster, simpler, or easier way to get off to a powerful start than to copy\nwhat somebody else is now selling .  There are always several really HOT programs in the\nopportunity marketplace, and discovering what they are and patterning yours after them is\nsuper-smart!\nGet past the moral issue that says copying is cheating\n!  It is not.  Instead, it is very smart\nbusiness, and many of the most successful compan ies in the world do it on a regular basis!\nSome of the world’s largest corporations have  entire departments that do nothing but pick\napart their competitor’s products to  get ideas for their own!  Almost all of the really good ideas\nin the marketplace have their origin in other areas where they were first used.  Some sharp\nbusiness person simply discovered and utilized them for their own conc ern!  You can do the\nsame thing.  It is easy to do and can make you huge amounts of money.\nAll of us in the Direct Response Marke ting business are constantly displaying our\n“secrets” to anyone who knows how to recognize and take advantage of them.  We do this every\ntime we run an ad or send a sale s letter to a ta rgeted prospect!\nAll you have to do is become  a customer of the best\ncompanies in the marketplace , buy from them regularly,\nstudy their sales solicitati ons, products and services,\nand then map out a plan to duplicate them.\nThe time to experiment with your own ideas for successful money-making plans or\nprograms is after you are already off to a powerful start\nwith one that stands the best chance of\nworking!\nIn truth most of your new ideas for a money- making plan or program  you want to sell\nWILL NOT WORK .  Most of the people who are very suc cessful in this marketplace have been\ndoing this for years, and you must follow their examples as closely as possible in the beginning .\nGetting off to a good start will give you a coupl e of things you really need:  Experience\nand momentum .  Both of these are vital to your success.  Many people who get off to a bad start\ntend to lose the drive necessary to build the momentum needed.\nStep 3\nBecome skilled at developing and\nselling informational products!\nInformational products have made my wife an d me and thousands of other people rich!\nYou should follow in our footsteps and get good at developing and selling your own!  It\nis well known, that informational products:\n• Have a high perceived value.\n• Are easy and cheap to produce.\n94 • Can be produced as you sell them with  no need for large inventories.\n• Are easy to produce and sell.\nAdd up these benefits and you will see that information is the perfect product !  A book\nthat costs around $1 to print can easily sell for up to $20 or more .  The best part is the fact\nthat the people who bought it will feel they  got their money’s worth if the book gives\nthem what they wanted!\nMarkups from 500% to 3000% are common for those of us who sell information for\na living.   Customers buy our products because they want the benefits from the\ninformation.  Spending $500 on a set of cassette tapes and a few reports that cost $20 to\nactually produce is a small price to pay if those products can show people how to make\n$2,000 a week for the rest of their life.  Do  customers really care if we make a 2,400%\nmarkup if the product does what we say it does ?\nThe secret to selling information products is simple, once you get the hang of it.\nA. Write your advertisement before  you create your product.\nB. Sell the end benefits of what  your informational product wi ll give to or do for the\nbuyer.\nC. Develop your informational products around these benefits !\nWriting your ad before you develop the produc t is smart because your enthusiasm is\nhigher when something is new, and you can make  promises of specific benefits in your ad\nand then carry those benefits into the produc t itself.  For example, an ad for a super\nweight loss product could say, “How To Lose 7 Pounds In Your First 3 Days Without\nDieting! See Page 23!”   On page 23 of the book you write a section called “How to Lose\n7 Pounds Your First 3 Days Without Dieting,”  and your product deli vers.  This is the\nsecret to writing powerful ads and then  giving the reader what you promise.\nThis is the secret way some of the biggest  and richest publishers who sell by Direct\nMarketing develop all of their products.  First , they decide what people want\n, write the\nbenefits, and then develop the product th at shows how to get the benefits the\nadvertisement (which was already written) tells them how to get.  There is an art and science to  developing fast-selling informa tional products.  It takes a\nbit of conceptual thinking to visualize the advertisement first, then the product - but all this will be second nature to you after you do a few of them!  You will need all the markup you can get with these products to offset the high cost of\nprinting, postage, and Direct Response Adve rtising which can be phenomenally high!\nStep 4\nImmediately develop a related  back-end product or service!\n95\nMany first time opportunity publishers neve r think past product number one.  This\nis a crucial mistake that costs them thousands of dollars  in lost revenue .  You will never\nhave a business without additional products to  sell.  All you will have is a promotion.\nThis gives you no staying power or any real strength.\nThe safest thing to do is insure that you’ll always make money is to\nconstantly develop new informational products.   Develop and test each one to your\ncustomer base.  The more targeted they are to this group, the greater your chances are of\nsuccess.   You must develop back-end products from the very beginning.   Do it while\nyou are developing your initial fr ont end product.  Think of l ogical related items to sell\nthat give them MORE of what they purchased from you the first time.     A good percentage of the people who buy your first product will automatically\npurchase your second one, too .  All you have to do is ask them by developing a great\noffer to sell it, and then presenting this offer to them while they are at the peak of their\ninterest (within a couple of weeks from the time they first do business with you).\nThe people who buy your initial product ha ve shown they are different than the\nrest of the prospects who did not respond.  Something made them take a chance on you\nand send you their money instead of sending it to all of the other individuals and\ncompanies selling the same type of opport unity products.  These people need to be\nrewarded for their business.\nYou reward these people by doing everything you can to show them they\nmade a good decision to do business with you.   Make your initial package as good as\nyou can .  Try to make a statement with it.  The better it is, th e more you will draw\nattention to yourself in the minds of each new customer, and the more open and\nresponsive they will be to all of the additio nal offers you will develop for them in the\nfuture.\nDeveloping additional products and services for your established customer\nbase is where all\nof the profits are in this business.   You will have a wide variety of\nmany different products that can be develope d as long as you are selling informational\nitems.     When most people think of selling in formation, they only think of written\nmaterials such as books and reports.  But thes e are just the beginning.  The truth is there\nare dozens of different info-products you can de velop and sell, and most of these are easy\nto produce.\nHere are the top ten informational products that have made our company\nmillions of dollars.   You can do it, too\n.\n96 1. Small reports that are 1 to 8 pages in le ngth and written to cover very specialized\ntopics.\n2. A newsletter that gives the customer mo re of your knowledge a little at a time!\n3. Continuity products, such as a booklet a month, or a tape a month.  Get enough\ncustomers on this regular service, and the profits can be staggering!\n4. Seminar or speech transcripts that have been edited for clarity.  Many people love\npublishing these because they can see the same information in several different forms.\n5. Home study courses which c ontain a wide variety of  informational products\nrelating to one subject that  are simply grouped together into one large package.\n6. Books or manuals written to give yo ur customers more knowledge and to\nstrengthen your authority in their minds.\n7. Recorded seminars, workshops, speeches, or  consultations that  you or one of your\nstaff members does for your customer base.  These are easy to put together since\nthey are a by-product of some type of event and are a great way to sell the\ninformation you do one time over and over again!\n8. How-to cassette tapes which are instructi onal.  These are easy to develop, once\nyou gain the experience by producing a few dozen of them.\n9. Cassette tapes of interviews, conversations , or roundtable discu ssions that contain\nvaluable information to share with your customers.  These audio products are so\nquick, easy, and simple to produce, and th e surprising thing is they give the\nperson who buys them tremendous value!\n10. Video tapes shot of seminars and discu ssions that give how-to information on a\nsubject that interests customers.\nAll of these products are fairly easy to develop.  It takes a little experience and discipline\nto develop these products on a regular basis, but you can do it as long as you do a little at\na time !\nThese are only ten of many different types of informational products you can\ndevelop.  About a dozen are just as profitable\n: tip sheets, computer software, posters,\nmembership kits, 900 numbers, back issues of  newsletters, and sets of books.  Marketing\nexpert Dan Kennedy has defined 39 different  ways you can sell informational products\nand freely admits there are probably ma ny different variations on these.\nYou have many different choice s available of all different types of info-products you can\ncreate.  Plus, you will have established custom ers to develop these products for.  These\ntwo factors together could make you rich in just a few short years!\nStep 5\nAlways test cheaply, roll out slowly,\nand continue working the other four steps!\nThese steps must be continually worked . It’s a process you must do over and over.\nThe best part is the fact that it becomes a great way of life, and the more you are\n97 involved in it, the better you will get.   I think of all the time, work, and effort we put\ninto some of our first informational products and compare it to the same amount of effort\nwe expend today.  The contrast is shocki ng!  Our first products took about 100 times\nmore effort than the ones we produce today!  The job just keeps ge tting easier and easier !\nThe same thing can happen to you, too.   This is a fun, challenging and rewarding way of life!   It does take continual\nwork, but the rewards can be so fantastic!\nIt feels good to get ideas for products or services you think will sell, produce\nthem in a simple info-product, test th em through the ranks of your established\ncustomers, and then make millio ns of dollars in the process!   You will get a feeling of\npower and control over your life like nothing you have ever experienced.\nBut nothing will replace the two key elements you need\n:\n1. Get started with these five steps.\n2. Do a little concentrated effort every single day.\nDoing these things will help you build a tremendous momentum that will keep you going\nstrong through any and all of the obstacles that are bound to  get in your way every now\nand then.\n• You gain knowledge through your constant efforts.\n• Every days worth of experience adds up s ynergistically with the previous day!\n• Your knowledge grows.\n• You learn while earning!\n• Your confidence expands!\n• You begin to gain new ideas of possibi lities you have never thought of before!\n• The ideas, methods, and strategies you de velop for making more money in this\nexciting business get better over accumulat ed days, weeks, and months of steady,\ndirected effort.\n• Before long, you are a much different person than you are now! You will feel better\nabout yourself, confident about your futu re, and passionate about the work you\ndo!\nHow can I promise you all of these things?   Simple.  These are the things that have\nhappened to my wife and me as a result of working these four steps .  They will happen to\nyou too!  There is no really mystery to success .  The actions that produced riches for us can do\nthe same thing for you, too.   It is our sincer est wish that you follow in our footsteps and\nuse the ideas we have just shared with you.  They will work, if you work them!\nGrossing $1,000,000 A Year Can Be Easy!\n98\nOur Company began grossing over $1,000,000 a year  almost from the beginning.  It is\neasy to do because:  1. There are hundreds of thousands of poten tial customers you can do business with.\n2. Sale of your front end and back end pr oducts can easily add up to millions of\ndollars in revenue every year!\nExamine the numbers it takes to gross $1,000,000 a year.\n• All you have to do is make 40 - $500.00 sales a week!\n• Or 80 - $250.00 sales a week!\n• Or 160 - $125.00 sales a week!\nYou can easily get this number of sales every week by doing two simple things:\n1. Develop an on-going front-end offer that  draws new customers to your company\non a small initial purchase.  (this can  bring in large numbers of qualified\ncustomers.)\n2. Create a large back-end product made up of  a collection of small informational\nproducts you simply group together into  one BIG PACKAGE!  This product can\nsell for $149.50 – $295.00 or even $495. Keep  building it up, so it has a higher\nperceived value and can be sold for more money!\nThis is the same formula our company has b een using for a number of years.  It is\nsurprisingly simple when you st op and think about it, and yet it has made us millions of\ndollars .  This formula works incredibly well b ecause the product we sell on the front-end\nhelps to sell the large back-end pack age!  It acts as a BIG SALES LETTER\n!\nThe initial sale we make helps new customers trust us.   We try to do everything to\nimpress them with the fact that we are differe nt than the other companies they have done\nbusiness with.    Asking somebody who has never done busin ess with you to spend $30.00 is a whole\ndifferent ballgame than asking them to spend $300. The way to get the larger amount is\nto first make the smaller sale.\nA nice percentage of new customers who buy  our inexpensive product for $10 to $50\ncan be convinced to spend an extra $100 to $500 if you show them how they can get much more of what they initially  bought at the lower price.\nThe time to think of making the BIG sale to your new customers is BEFORE you begin\nmarketing your front-end item.  The secret  is in trying to give them only enough\ninformation to make them want to immediately send for more.\n99 The ad for your bigger back-end package shoul d make customers feel they are really\nmissing out on something if they do no send for it.  The idea is to make them want it badly by creating this vacuum that must be fi lled.  The best marketers know how to make\nit almost HURT not\nto send your money in for their offer!\nStudy everything you can from the pe ople that are making millions of\ndollars in Direct Response Marketing.   Don’t envy these people, join\nthem!

As a Financial Freedom Coach, I often\ntell my clients that they will reach their financial goals faster if they’ll take the time to find out\nwhat other successful entrepreneurs do and how they think – and duplic ate their actions and\nbeliefs. I’ve been doing this myself for almost  two decades – and have generated millions of\ndollars in the process.  My secr et: I have discovered that successful entrepreneurs have some key\nstrategies in common.\nMillionaire Strategy #1:\nFocus on Your Ultimate Vision at All Times\nSuccessful entrepreneurs start with the end in mi nd – and work toward the vision of what they\nwant their business to become.   Take some time to decide exactly what you want your business to become over the next 5, 10, even 20 years or longer. Then set aside time, ever y day, to visualize that same mental picture of\nyour successful business. Successful entrepreneur s know exactly what they’re working towards.\nWhenever they make a business decision, it’s a ll with their ultimate vision in mind. They know\nexactly what they want their business to look li ke. And, because they have a clear vision in mind,\nit makes daily decision-making much easier. After all, with a clear-cut vision of what you want\nyour business to become, you can always ask yourself, “Will this action move me closer to creating the business I’m visualizing?” If the answer is “yes”, you know you can move forward\nconfidently.\nMillionaire Strategy #2:\nPlan For Success... But Be Flexible\nOnce you have a clear vision of your business, it’s time to create a plan to reach your ultimate\ngoal. Your plan can be as detailed or as basi c as you wish. Personally, my  overall business plan\nis completely explained on two types pages. The actual steps to implementing this plan are much\nmore detailed, but the overall pl an is very simple. One thing I’ ve discovered from talking to\nother entrepreneurs, as well as running my own multi-million dollar business, is that while a plan\nis important to the success of your busin ess, flexibility is also important.\nSuccessful entrepreneurs understand that a plan is  merely a starting poin t. It’s a “best case\nscenario” of how you would like to progress from  where you are – to where you’d like to be.\n101 However, in every business venture, challenge s arise which can either momentarily bump you\noff track... or even make you re-think your plan entirely. The key to weathering these challenges\nis to remain flexible – and work around whatev er new circumstances are staring you in the face.\nIf some seeming “disaster” has occurred, look at  it as an opportunity for you to stretch your\ncreativity muscles – and find a new path to your ultimate outcome. I know in my own business, I’ve dealt with all sorts of challenges, from a flooded office (ruining t housands of dollars in\nproducts) to major moves across the country to an industry change that almost completely\ncrushed my business overnight. By thinking on my  feet, I’ve been able to change my plans\n(sometimes drastically) – and continue on my journey to my ultimate outcome. Every day brings new challenges and opportunities. By remaining fl exible, I’m able to solve problems faster and\nprofit from new ideas, without waveri ng from my overall business vision.\nMillionaire Strategy #3:\nFocus on Solutions, Not Problems\nChallenges in a business (as well as in life) are unavoidable. What separates successful\nentrepreneurs from everyone else is their ability to quickly focu s on finding or creating a solution\nto each problem that appears. Many people starting a new business find themselves overwhelmed with paperwork, red tape, and hundreds of decisi ons that could easily make or break their\nfledgling company. While some people react as vict ims, complaining that “It’s too hard” to start\na business and “there are just too many things  going wrong for this work”, the successful\nentrepreneur focuses his energy on finding and creating solutions.\nI remember when my business changed almost overn ight. I had been brokering advertising for an\nInternet search engine – and, w ithout any advance warning, the sear ch engine decided the service\ndidn’t meet their long-term goals, so they instantly shut it off. At the time, marketing this service\nhad become so profitable, I completely shut down the publishing portion of  my business. With\nthe announcement that the service would no longer be available, effective immediately, I jumped\ninto action. I searched for days for a comparable  service to market to the prospects who were\ncontacting my company daily – wh ile at the same time, creating a new business plan that would\nget me back into my first love, publishing. The ne xt year was brutal. Cha nging directions for any\ncompany can be an expensive and time-consum ing proposition. However, with a strong, new\nbusiness plan, and a new vision for my business, I was able to save my business. Today, having\nlearned many lessons from this experience, my bus iness is stronger than before, with even bigger\ngrowth ahead. While it’s much easier to complain  to friends and family and play the “Why me?”\ngame, successful entrepreneurs jump into action wh enever a problem presents itself – and focus\non the solution.\nMillionaire Strategy #4:\nLet Your Passion Drive You to Success\nWhile some start-up entrepreneurs may have a romantic image in their minds about creating their\nown company and generating millions, the truth is that  there is a lot of hard work and late hours\nthat go into creating any new business. Often, peopl e jump into a new business because they hate\ntheir job – and they believe they’d be a better “boss” than anyone else. Others simply want to\nmake more money – and believe they will have  more time off if they were self-employed.\nHowever, the truth is that starting a new busin ess – and working to make it successful – is a\n102 constant effort. It takes a lot of time, mone y, and energy to turn your business dreams into\nreality.    The key is to create a business that you’re pass ionate about. Your passion for your business can\nbe the key to keeping you focused when things  get tough. In fact, many successful entrepreneurs\novercame tremendous obstacles in their journey fo r success, driven only by their burning desire\nand passion for what they wanted to accomplis h. Since millionaire entrepreneurs have an\nexciting vision of what they want to achieve, their passion for what they’re doing carries them\nthrough the inevitable problems, hassl es, and headaches that appear.\nThat’s why it’s important to have passion for your business. I’ve talked to too many people who\nhave chosen to start a business becau se they read in a magazine that  it’s going to be the “next big\nthing” – and they believe they can cash in fast, even though they have no passion for the products they’ll be selling. Others see millionair e entrepreneurs who have created wealth in a\nparticular field – and decide to follow in thei r footsteps, not understand ing that the reason the\nentrepreneur was successful wasn’t necessarily th e industry he or she got involved with. It had a\nlot to do with the time, effort, and energy that  went into building a nd creating the business.\nRealize that dreams of millions ma y fade away when the problems mount. You may want to fire\nyourself when challenges arise. But if you’re doi ng something that you’re truly passionate about,\nsomething that you love doing every day, you’ll  have the energy to work through every\nchallenge – and ultimately achieve your goal of creating a successful business.\nMillionaire Strategy #5:\nLearn from the Experience of Other Successful Entrepreneurs\nOne of my favorite quotes, by Admira l Hyman Rickover, is “It is n ecessary for us to learn from\nothers' mistakes. You will not live long enough to make them all yourself.” Many new business\nowners bitten by the entrepreneurial “bug” have a desire to scratch their way to the top, through\nall sorts of chaos and mayhem. Instead of lear ning lessons from people who have gone before\nthem, they make the same costly, time-consuming mistakes that keep them from reaching their\ngoals in a timely manner. With the built-in independence entrepreneurs have, it’s easy to\nunderstand why most choose not to  get advice from successful, wea lthy entrepreneurs. However,\nif you choose to go into any vent ure, understand that there are people who can help you avoid\nmany of the mistakes that can cripple or crush your business. Even successful entrepreneurs in\nother industries, running busine sses completely different than yours, can give you invaluable\nadvice on hiring, finances, regulations, negotiatin g, time management, and a wide variety of\nstrategies that will save  you time, money, and energy.\nThe easiest way, of course, is to read books wr itten about (and by) wealthy entrepreneurs.\nAnother method is to attend seminars and works hops that feature these wealthy entrepreneurs.\nOther methods include getting live coaching from  entrepreneurs, search out entrepreneurial\ndiscussion boards and forums online, or purchase books and tapes produced by successful\nentrepreneurs. The few dollars you’ll spend on education can help you avoid thousands of dollars\nin expensive, time-consuming trial and error.\n103 Millionaire Strategy #6:\nLearning Never Stops for the Wise Entrepreneur\nIf you’re not growing, you’re dying. The best entr epreneurs, the best success coaches, the best\npeople at whatever they do, are always looking for that extra e dge. You’ll discover that the\nworld’s wealthiest, most successful people are constant students. Th ey’re always reading,\nlooking for a new insight or idea. They’re listening to educational and motivational audios to and\nfrom work, while they’re exercising, and during their free time. They’re attending seminars and\nevents to learn from other experts in their field, as well as in other fields. In fact, talk to wealthy\nentrepreneurs, and you’ll see that most of them have massive libraries of wealth-building and\nsuccess books, audios, and programs. They invest their money in additional education, because\nthey realize that to keep on t op of their game and create more  opportunities, they need to be\nconstantly learning and growing.   It’s important that you understand that very  little separates you from multi-millionaire\nentrepreneurs. You probably have the same dr ive. You probably have similar goals. You’re\nprobably an intelligent, passionate person who wants to create the best business possible – and generate the wealth a strong business can produce. The only th ing that separates you from\nwealthy, famous entrepreneurs – is what you know. Your focus s hould be to discover everything\nyou can from other entrepreneurs. I recently pur chased four huge bookcases to hold the hundreds\nof books, manuals, courses, audio tapes, CD’s, vi deos, and DVD’s I’ve purchased over the last\n19 years. And I continue to spend tens of thous ands of dollars a year on additional educational\nmaterials. What I’ve discovered is that the more I learn, the more wealth I generate for myself\nand those around me. Make a commitment today to become a life-long learner – and you will\ncreate the business and wealth you desire.\n104 8\nLink Directory\n23 Affiliate Secrets\nDiscover 23 fast, easy ways to promote your affi liate program and become a super affiliate.\nwww.23affiliatesecrets.com\n33 Days to Online Profits Course\nFinally, a 33-day, step-b y-step system to maki ng money on the Internet.\nwww.30daystoprofits.com\n33 Days to Online Profits Video System\nThe video version that reveals how to  make money online in just 33 days!\nwww.30daystowealth.com\n6-Week Advanced Instant Internet  Profits Home-Study Course\nLooking to make $100,000 (or more) on the Intern et.
