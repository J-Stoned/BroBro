All my life I’ve been a patsy. For as long as I\ncan recall, I’ve been an easy mark for the pitches of peddlers, fund-\nraisers, and operators of one sort or another. True, only some of these\npeople have had dishonorable motives. The others—representatives of\ncertain charitable agencies, for instance—have had the best of intentions.\nNo matter. With personally disquieting frequency, I have always found\nmyself in possession of unwanted magazine subscriptions or tickets to\nthe sanitation workers’ ball. Probably this long-standing status as\nsucker accounts for my interest in the study of compliance: Just what\nare the factors that cause one person to say yes to another person? And\nwhich techniques most effectively use these factors to bring about such\ncompliance? I wondered why it is that a request stated in a certain way\nwill be rejected, while a request that asks for the same favor in a slightly\ndifferent fashion will be successful.\nSo in my role as an experimental social psychologist, I began to do\nresearch into the psychology of compliance. At first the research\ntook the form of experiments performed, for the most part, in my\nlaboratory and on college students. I wanted to find out which psycho-\nlogical principles influence the tendency to comply with a request. Right\nnow, psychologists know quite a bit about these principles—what they\nare and how they work. I have characterized such principles as weapons\nof influence and will report on some of the most important in the up-\ncoming chapters.\nAfter a time, though, I began to realize that the experimental work,\nwhile necessary, wasn’t enough. It didn’t allow me to judge the import-\nance of the principles in the world beyond the psychology building and\nthe campus where I was examining them. It became clear that if I was\nto understand fully the psychològy of compliance, I would need to\nbroaden my scope of investigation. I would need to look to the compli-\nance professionals—the people who had been using the principles on\nme all my life. They know what works and what doesn’t; the law of\nsurvival of the fittest assures it. Their business is to make us comply,\nand their livelihoods depend on it. Those who don’t know how to get\npeople to say yes soon fall away; those who do, stay and flourish.\nOf course, the compliance professionals aren’t the only ones who\nknow about and use these principles to help them get their way. We\nall employ them and fall victim to them, to some degree, in our daily\ninteractions with neighbors, friends, lovers, and offspring. But the\ncompliance practitioners have much more than the vague and amateur-\nish understanding of what works than the rest of us have. As I thought\nabout it, I knew that they represented the richest vein of information\nabout compliance available to me. For nearly three years, then, I com-\nbined my experimental studies with a decidedly more entertaining\nprogram of systematic immersion into the world of compliance profes-\nsionals—sales operators, fund-raisers, recruiters, advertisers, and others.\nThe purpose was to observe, from the inside, the techniques and\nstrategies most commonly and effectively used by a broad range of\ncompliance practitioners. That program of observation sometimes took\nthe form of interviews with the practitioners themselves and sometimes\nwith the natural enemies (for example, police buncosquad officers,\nconsumer agencies) of certain of the practitioners. At other times it in-\nvolved an intensive examination of the written materials by which\ncompliance techniques are passed down from one generation to anoth-\ner—sales manuals and the like.\nMost frequently, though, it has taken the form of participant observa-\ntion. Participant observation is a research approach in which the re-\nsearcher becomes a spy of sorts. With disguised identity and intent, the\ninvestigator infiltrates the setting of interest and becomes a full-fledgedvi / Influence\nparticipant in the group to be studied. So when I wanted to learn about\nthe compliance tactics of encyclopedia (or vacuum-cleaner, or portrait-\nphotography, or dance-lesson) sales organizations, I would answer a\nnewspaper ad for sales trainees and have them teach me their methods.\nUsing similar but not identical approaches, I was able to penetrate ad-\nvertising, public-relations, and fund-raising agencies to examine their\ntechniques. Much of the evidence presented in this book, then, comes\nfrom my experience posing as a compliance professional, or aspiring\nprofessional, in a large variety of organizations dedicated to getting us\nto say yes.\nOne aspect of what I learned in this three-year period of participant\nobservation was most instructive. Although there are thousands of\ndifferent tactics that compliance practitioners employ to produce yes,\nthe majority fall within six basic categories. Each of these categories is\ngoverned by a fundamental psychological principle that directs human\nbehavior and, in so doing, gives the tactics their power. The book is\norganized around these six principles, one to a chapter. The prin-\nciples—consistency, reciprocation, social proof, authority, liking, and\nscarcity—are each discussed in terms of their function in the society\nand in terms of how their enormous force can be commissioned by a\ncompliance professional who deftly incorporates them into requests\nfor purchases, donations, concessions, votes, assent, etc. It is worthy of\nnote that I have not included among the six principles the simple rule\nof material self-interest—that people want to get the most and pay the\nleast for their choices. This omission does not stem from any perception\non my part that the desire to maximize benefits and minimize costs is\nunimportant in driving our decisions. Nor does it come from any\nevidence I have that compliance professionals ignore the power of this\nrule. Quite the opposite: In my investigations, I frequently saw practi-\ntioners use (sometimes honestly, sometimes not) the compelling “I can\ngive you a good deal” approach. I choose not to treat the material self-\ninterest rule separately in this book because I see it as a motivational\ngiven, as a goes-without-saying factor that deserves acknowledgment\nbut not extensive description.\nFinally, each principle is examined as to its ability to produce a distinct\nkind of automatic, mindless compliance from people, that is, a willing-\nness to say yes without thinking first. The evidence suggests that the\never-accelerating pace and informational crush of modern life will make\nthis particular form of unthinking compliance more and more prevalent\nin the future. It will be increasingly important for the society, therefore,\nto understand the how and why of automatic influence.\nIt has been some time since the first edition of Influence was published.Robert B. Cialdini Ph.D / vii\nIn the interim, some things have happened that I feel deserve a place\nin this new edition. First, we now know more about the influence\nprocess than before. The study of persuasion, compliance, and change\nhas advanced, and the pages that follow have been adapted to reflect\nthat progress. In addition to an overall update of the material, I have\nincluded a new feature that was stimulated by the responses of prior\nreaders.\nThat new feature highlights the experiences of individuals who have\nread Influence, recognized how one of the principles worked on (or for)\nthem in a particular instance, and wrote to me describing the event.\nTheir descriptions, which appear in the Reader’s Reports at the end of\neach chapter, illustrate how easily and frequently we can fall victim to\nthe pull of the influence process in our everyday lives.\nI wish to thank the following individuals who—either directly or\nthrough their course instructors—contributed the Reader’s Reports\nused in this edition: Pat Bobbs, Mark Hastings, James Michaels, Paul\nR. Nail, Alan J. Resnik, Daryl Retzlaff, Dan Swift, and Karla Vasks. In\naddition, I would like to invite new readers to submit similar reports\nfor possible publication in a future edition.

CIALDINIviii / Influence\nChapter 1\nWEAPONS OF\nINFLUENCE\nEverything should be made as simple as possible, but not sim-\npler.\n—ALBERT EINSTEIN\nIGOT A PHONE CALL ONE DAY FROM A FRIEND WHO HAD RECENTLY\nopened an Indian jewelry store in Arizona. She was giddy with a\ncurious piece of news. Something fascinating had just happened, and\nshe thought that, as a psychologist, I might be able to explain it to her.\nThe story involved a certain allotment of turquoise jewelry she had\nbeen having trouble selling. It was the peak of the tourist season, the\nstore was unusually full of customers, the turquoise pieces were of good\nquality for the prices she was asking; yet they had not sold. My friend\nhad attempted a couple of standard sales tricks to get them moving.\nShe tried calling attention to them by shifting their location to a more\ncentral display area; no luck. She even told her sales staff to “push” the\nitems hard, again without success.\nFinally, the night before leaving on an out-of-town buying trip, she\nscribbled an exasperated note to her head saleswoman, “Everything in\nthis display case, price × ½,” hoping just to be rid of the offending pieces,\neven if at a loss. When she returned a few days later, she was not sur-\nprised to find that every article had been sold. She was shocked, though,\nto discover that, because the employee had read the “½” in her scrawled\nmessage as a “2,” the entire allotment had sold out at twice the original\nprice!\nThat’s when she called me. I thought I knew what had happened but\ntold her that, if I were to explain things properly, she would have to\nlisten to a story of mine. Actually, it isn’t my story; it’s about mother\nturkeys, and it belongs to the relatively new science of ethology—the\nstudy of animals in their natural settings. Turkey mothers are good\nmothers—loving, watchful, and protective. They spend much of their\ntime tending, warming, cleaning, and huddling the young beneath\nthem. But there is something odd about their method. Virtually all of\nthis mothering is triggered by one thing: the “cheep-cheep” sound of\nyoung turkey chicks. Other identifying features of the chicks, such as\ntheir smell, touch, or appearance, seem to play minor roles in the\nmothering process. If a chick makes the “cheep-cheep” noise, its\nmother will care for it; if not, the mother will ignore or sometimes kill\nit.\nThe extreme reliance of maternal turkeys upon this one sound was\ndramatically illustrated by animal behaviorist M. W. Fox in his descrip-\ntion of an experiment involving a mother turkey and a stuffed polecat.1\nFor a mother turkey, a polecat is a natural enemy whose approach is\nto be greeted with squawking, pecking, clawing rage. Indeed, the exper-\nimenters found that even a stuffed model of a polecat, when drawn by\na string toward a mother turkey, received an immediate and furious\nattack. When, however, the same stuffed replica carried inside it a small\nrecorder that played the “cheep-cheep” sound of baby turkeys, the\nmother not only accepted the oncoming polecat but gathered it under-\nneath her. When the machine was turned off, the polecat model again\ndrew a vicious attack.\nHow ridiculous a female turkey seems under these circumstances:\nShe will embrace a natural enemy just because it goes “cheep-cheep,”\nand she will mistreat or murder one of her own chicks just because it\ndoes not. She looks like an automaton whose maternal instincts are\nunder the automatic control of that single sound. The ethologists tell\nus that this sort of thing is far from unique to the turkey. They have\nbegun to identify regular, blindly mechanical patterns of action in a\nwide variety of species.\nCalled fixed-action patterns, they can involve intricate sequences of\nbehavior, such as entire courtship or mating rituals. A fundamental\ncharacteristic of these patterns is that the behaviors that compose them\noccur in virtually the same fashion and in the same order every time.\nIt is almost as if the patterns were recorded on tapes within the animals.\nWhen the situation calls for courtship, the courtship tape gets played;\nwhen the situation calls for mothering, the maternal-behavior tape gets2 / Influence\nplayed. Click and the appropriate tape is activated; whirr and out rolls\nthe standard sequence of behaviors.\nThe most interesting thing about all this is the way the tapes are ac-\ntivated. When a male animal acts to defend his territory, for instance,\nit is the intrusion of another male of the same species that cues the ter-\nritorial-defense tape of rigid vigilance, threat, and, if need be, combat\nbehaviors. But there is a quirk in the system. It is not the rival male as\na whole that is the trigger; it is some specific feature of him, the trigger\nfeature. Often the trigger feature will be just one tiny aspect of the totality\nthat is the approaching intruder. Sometimes a shade of color is the\ntrigger feature. The experiments of ethologists have shown, for instance,\nthat a male robin, acting as if a rival robin had entered its territory, will\nvigorously attack nothing more than a clump of robin-redbreast feathers\nplaced there. At the same time, it will virtually ignore a perfect stuffed\nreplica of a male robin without red breast feathers; similar results have\nbeen found in another species of bird, the bluethroat, where it appears\nthat the trigger for territorial defense is a specific shade of blue breast\nfeathers.2\nBefore we enjoy too smugly the ease with which lower animals can\nbe tricked by trigger features into reacting in ways wholly inappropriate\nto the situation, we might realize two things. First, the automatic, fixed-\naction patterns of these animals work very well the great majority of\nthe time. For example, because only healthy, normal turkey chicks make\nthe peculiar sound of baby turkeys, it makes sense for mother turkeys\nto respond maternally to that single “cheep-cheep” noise. By reacting\nto just that one stimulus, the average mother turkey will nearly always\nbehave correctly. It takes a trickster like a scientist to make her tapelike\nresponse seem silly. The second important thing to understand is that\nwe, too, have our preprogrammed tapes; and, although they usually\nwork to our advantage, the trigger features that activate them can be\nused to dupe us into playing them at the wrong times.3\nThis parallel form of human automatic action is aptly demonstrated\nin an experiment by Harvard social psychologist Ellen Langer. A well-\nknown principle of human behavior says that when we ask someone\nto do us a favor we will be more successful if we provide a reason.\nPeople simply like to have reasons for what they do. Langer demon-\nstrated this unsurprising fact by asking a small favor of people waiting\nin line to use a library copying machine: Excuse me, I have five pages. May\nI use the Xerox machine because I’m in a rush? The effectiveness of this\nrequest-plus-reason was nearly total: Ninety-four percent of those asked\nlet her skip ahead of them in line. Compare this success rate to the results\nwhen she made the request only: Excuse me, I have five pages. May I useRobert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 3\nthe Xerox machine? Under those circumstances, only 60 percent of those\nasked complied. At first glance, it appears that the crucial difference\nbetween the two requests was the additional information provided by\nthe words “because I’m in a rush.” But a third type of request tried by\nLanger showed that this was not the case. It seems that it was not the\nwhole series of words, but the first one, “because,” that made the differ-\nence. Instead of including a real reason for compliance, Langer’s third\ntype of request used the word “because” and then, adding nothing new,\nmerely restated the obvious: Excuse me, I have five pages. May I use the\nXerox machine because I have to make some copies? The result was that once\nagain nearly all (93 percent) agreed, even though no real reason, no\nnew information, was added to justify their compliance. Just as the\n“cheep-cheep” sound of turkey chicks triggered an automatic mothering\nresponse from maternal turkeys—even when it emanated from a stuffed\npolecat—so, too, did the word “because” trigger an automatic compli-\nance response from Langer’s subjects, even when they were given no\nsubsequent reason to comply. Click, whirr!4\nAlthough some of Langer’s additional findings show that there are\nmany situations in which human behavior does not work in a mechan-\nical, tape-activated way, what is astonishing is how often it does. For\ninstance, consider the strange behavior of those jewelry-store customers\nwho swooped down on an allotment of turquoise pieces only after the\nitems had been mistakenly offered at double their original price. I can\nmake no sense of their behavior, unless it is viewed in click, whirr terms.\nThe customers, mostly well-to-do vacationers with little knowledge\nof turquoise, were using a standard principle—a stereotype—to guide\ntheir buying: “expensive = good.” Thus the vacationers, who wanted\n“good” jewelry, saw the turquoise pieces as decidedly more valuable\nand desirable when nothing about them was enhanced but the price.\nPrice alone had become a trigger feature for quality; and a dramatic\nincrease in price alone had led to a dramatic increase in sales among\nthe quality-hungry buyers. Click, whirr!\nIt is easy to fault the tourists for their foolish purchase decisions. But\na close look offers a kinder view. These were people who had been\nbrought up on the rule “You get what you pay for” and who had seen\nthat rule borne out over and over in their lives. Before long, they had\ntranslated the rule to mean “expensive = good.” The “expensive = good”\nstereotype had worked quite well for them in the past, since normally\nthe price of an item increases along with its worth; a higher price typic-\nally reflects higher quality. So when they found themselves in the pos-\nition of wanting good turquoise jewelry without much knowledge of4 / Influence\nturquoise, they understandably relied on the old standby feature of\ncost to determine the jewelry’s merits.\nAlthough they probably did not realize it, by reacting solely to the\nprice feature of the turquoise, they were playing a shortcut version of\nbetting the odds. Instead of stacking all the odds in their favor by trying\npainstakingly to master each of the things that indicate the worth of\nturquoise jewelry, they were counting on just one—the one they knew\nto be usually associated with the quality of any item. They were betting\nthat price alone would tell them all they needed to know. This time,\nbecause someone mistook a “½” for a “2,” they bet wrong. But in the\nlong run, over all the past and future situations of their lives, betting\nthose shortcut odds may represent the most rational approach possible.\nIn fact, automatic, stereotyped behavior is prevalent in much of hu-\nman action, because in many cases it is the most efficient form of behav-\ning, and in other cases it is simply necessary. You and I exist in an ex-\ntraordinarily complicated stimulus environment, easily the most rapidly\nmoving and complex that has ever existed on this planet. To deal with\nit, we need shortcuts. We can’t be expected to recognize and analyze all\nthe aspects in each person, event, and situation we encounter in even\none day. We haven’t the time, energy, or capacity for it. Instead, we\nmust very often use our stereotypes, our rules of thumb to classify\nthings according to a few key features and then to respond mindlessly\nwhen one or another of these trigger features is present.\nSometimes the behavior that unrolls will not be appropriate for the\nsituation, because not even the best stereotypes and trigger features\nwork every time. But we accept their imperfection, since there is really\nno other choice. Without them we would stand frozen—cataloging,\nappraising, and calibrating—as the time for action sped by and away.\nAnd from all indications, we will be relying on them to an even greater\nextent in the future. As the stimuli saturating our lives continue to grow\nmore intricate and variable, we will have to depend increasingly on\nour shortcuts to handle them all.\nThe renowned British philosopher Alfred North Whitehead recog-\nnized this inescapable quality of modern life when he asserted that\n“civilization advances by extending the number of operations we can\nperform without thinking about them.” Take, for example, the “ad-\nvance” offered to civilization by the discount coupon, which allows\nconsumers to assume that they will receive a reduced purchase price\nby presenting the coupon. The extent to which we have learned to op-\nerate mechanically on that assumption is illustrated in the experience\nof one automobile-tire company. Mailed-out coupons that—because of\na printing error—offered no savings to recipients produced just as much\ncustomer response as did error-free coupons that offered substantialRobert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 5\nsavings. The obvious but instructive point here is that we expect dis-\ncount coupons to do double duty. Not only do we expect them to save\nus money, we also expect them to save us the time and mental energy\nrequired to think about how to do it. In today’s world, we need the first\nadvantage to handle pocketbook strain; but we need the second advant-\nage to handle something potentially more important—brain strain.\nIt is odd that despite their current widespread use and looming future\nimportance, most of us know very little about our automatic behavior\npatterns. Perhaps that is so precisely because of the mechanistic, un-\nthinking manner in which they occur. Whatever the reason, it is vital\nthat we clearly recognize one of their properties: They make us terribly\nvulnerable to anyone who does know how they work.\nTo understand fully the nature of our vulnerability, another glance\nat the work of the ethologists is in order. It turns out that these animal\nbehaviorists with their recorded “cheep-cheeps” and their clumps of\ncolored breast feathers are not the only ones who have discovered how\nto activate the behavior tapes of various species. There is a group of\norganisms, often termed mimics, that copy the trigger features of other\nanimals in an attempt to trick these animals into mistakenly playing\nthe right behavior tapes at the wrong times. The mimic will then exploit\nthis altogether inappropriate action for its own benefit.\nTake, for example, the deadly trick played by the killer females of\none genus of firefly (Photuris) on the males of another firefly genus\n(Photinus). Understandably, the Photinus males scrupulously avoid\ncontact with the bloodthirsty Photuris females. But through centuries\nof experience, the female hunters have located a weakness in their\nprey—a special blinking courtship code by which members of the vic-\ntims’ species tell one another they are ready to mate. Somehow, the\nPhoturis female has cracked the Photinus courtship code. By mimicking\nthe flashing mating signals of her prey, the murderess is able to feast\non the bodies of males whose triggered courtship tapes cause them to\nfly mechanically into death’s, not love’s, embrace.\nInsects seem to be the most severe exploiters of the automaticity of\ntheir prey; it is not uncommon to find their victims duped to death. But\nless uncompromising forms of exploitation occur as well. There is, for\ninstance, a little fish, the saber-toothed blenny, that takes advantage of\nan unusual program of cooperation worked out by members of two\nother species of fish. The cooperating fish form a Mutt and Jeff team\nconsisting of a large grouper fish on the one hand and a much smaller\ntype of fish on the other. The smaller fish serves as a cleaner to the larger\none, which allows the cleaner to approach it and even enter its mouth\nto pick off fungus and other parasites that have attached themselves to6 / Influence\nthe big fish’s teeth or gills. It is a beautiful arrangement: The big grouper\ngets cleaned of harmful pests, and the cleaner fish gets an easy dinner.\nThe larger fish normally devours any other small fish foolish enough\nto come close to it. But when the cleaner approaches, the big fish sud-\ndenly stops all movement and floats open-mouthed and nearly immobile\nin response to an undulating dance that the cleaner performs. This\ndance appears to be the trigger feature of the cleaner that activates the\ndramatic passivity of the big fish. It also provides the saber-toothed\nblenny with an angle—a chance to take advantage of the cleaning ritual\nof the cooperators. The blenny will approach the large predator, copying\nthe undulations of the cleaner’s dance and automatically producing the\ntranquil, unmoving posture of the big fish. Then, true to its name, it\nwill quickly rip a mouthful from the larger fish’s flesh and dart away\nbefore its startled victim can recover.5\nThere is a strong but sad parallel in the human jungle. We too have\nexploiters who mimic trigger features for our own brand of automatic\nresponding. Unlike the mostly instinctive response sequences of non-\nhumans, our automatic tapes usually develop from psychological\nprinciples or stereotypes we have learned to accept. Although they vary\nin their force, some of these principles possess a tremendous ability to\ndirect human action. We have been subjected to them from such an\nearly point in our lives, and they have moved us about so pervasively\nsince then, that you and I rarely perceive their power. In the eyes of\nothers, though, each such principle is a detectable and ready weapon—a\nweapon of automatic influence.\nThere is a group of people who know very well where the weapons\nof automatic influence lie and who employ them regularly and expertly\nto get what they want. They go from social encounter to social encounter\nrequesting others to comply with their wishes; their frequency of success\nis dazzling. The secret of their effectiveness lies in the way they structure\ntheir requests, the way they arm themselves with one or another of the\nweapons of influence that exist within the social environment. To do\nthis may take no more than one correctly chosen word that engages a\nstrong psychological principle and sets an automatic behavior tape\nrolling within us. And trust the human exploiters to learn quickly exactly\nhow to profit from our tendency to respond mechanically according to\nthese principles.\nRemember my friend the jewelry-store owner? Although she benefited\nby accident the first time, it did not take her long to begin exploiting\nthe “expensive = good” stereotype regularly and intentionally. Now,\nduring the tourist season, she first tries to speed the sale of an item that\nhas been difficult to move by increasing its price substantially. She\nclaims that this is marvelously cost-effective. When it works on theRobert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 7\nunsuspecting vacationers—as it frequently does—it results in an\nenormous profit margin. And even when it is not initially successful,\nshe can mark the article “Reduced from _____” and sell it at its original\nprice while still taking advantage of the “expensive = good” reaction\nto the inflated figure.\nBy no means is my friend original in this last use of the “expensive\n= good” rule to snare those seeking a bargain. Culturist and author Leo\nRosten gives the example of the Drubeck brothers, Sid and Harry, who\nowned a men’s tailor shop in Rosten’s neighborhood while he was\ngrowing up in the 1930s. Whenever the salesman, Sid, had a new cus-\ntomer trying on suits in front of the shop’s three-sided mirror, he would\nadmit to a hearing problem, and, as they talked, he would repeatedly\nrequest that the man speak more loudly to him. Once the customer had\nfound a suit he liked and had asked for the price, Sid would call to his\nbrother, the head tailor, at the back of the room, “Harry, how much for\nthis suit?” Looking up from his work—and greatly exaggerating the\nsuit’s true price—Harry would call back, “For that beautiful all-wool\nsuit, forty-two dollars.” Pretending not to have heard and cupping his\nhand to his ear, Sid would ask again. Once more Harry would reply,\n“Forty-two dollars.” At this point, Sid would turn to the customer and\nreport, “He says twenty-two dollars.” Many a man would hurry to buy\nthe suit and scramble out of the shop with his “expensive = good”\nbargain before Poor Sid discovered the “mistake.”\nThere are several components shared by most of the weapons of\nautomatic influence to be described in this book. We have already dis-\ncussed two of them—the nearly mechanical process by which the power\nwithin these weapons can be activated, and the consequent exploitability\nof this power by anyone who knows how to trigger them. A third\ncomponent involves the way that the weapons of automatic influence\nlend their force to those who use them. It’s not that the weapons, like\na set of heavy clubs, provide a conspicuous arsenal to be used by one\nperson to bludgeon another into submission.\nThe process is much more sophisticated and subtle. With proper ex-\necution, the exploiters need hardly strain a muscle to get their way. All\nthat is required is to trigger the great stores of influence that already\nexist in the situation and direct them toward the intended target. In this\nsense, the approach is not unlike that of the Japanese martial-art form\ncalled jujitsu. A woman employing jujitsu would utilize her own\nstrength only minimally against an opponent. Instead, she would exploit\nthe power inherent in such naturally present principles as gravity,\nleverage, momentum, and inertia. If she knows how and where to en-\ngage the action of these principles, she can easily defeat a physically8 / Influence\nstronger rival. And so it is for the exploiters of the weapons of automatic\ninfluence that exist naturally around us. The exploiters can commission\nthe power of these weapons for use against their targets while exerting\nlittle personal force. This last feature of the process allows the exploiters\nan enormous additional benefit—the ability to manipulate without the\nappearance of manipulation. Even the victims themselves tend to see\ntheir compliance as determined by the action of natural forces rather\nthan by the designs of the person who profits from that compliance.\nAn example is in order. There is a principle in human perception, the\ncontrast principle, that affects the way we see the difference between\ntwo things that are presented one after another. Simply put, if the second\nitem is fairly different from the first, we will tend to see it as more dif-\nferent than it actually is. So if we lift a light object first and then lift a\nheavy object, we will estimate the second object to be heavier than if\nwe had lifted it without first trying the light one. The contrast principle\nis well established in the field of psychophysics and applies to all sorts\nof perceptions besides weight. If we are talking to a beautiful woman\nat a cocktail party and are then joined by an unattractive one, the second\nwoman will strike us as less attractive than she actually is.\nIn fact, studies done on the contrast principle at Arizona State and\nMontana State universities suggest that we may be less satisfied with\nthe physical attractiveness of our own lovers because of the way the\npopular media bombard us with examples of unrealistically attractive\nmodels. In one study college students rated a picture of an average-\nlooking member of the opposite sex as less attractive if they had first\nlooked through the ads in some popular magazines. In another study,\nmale college-dormitory residents rated the photo of a potential blind\ndate. Those who did so while watching an episode of the Charlie’s Angels\nTV series viewed the blind date as a less attractive woman than those\nwho rated her while watching a different show. Apparently it was the\nuncommon beauty of the Angels female stars that made the blind date\nseem less attractive.6\nA nice demonstration of perceptual contrast is sometimes employed\nin psychophysics laboratories to introduce students to the principle\nfirsthand. Each student takes a turn sitting in front of three pails of\nwater—one cold, one at room temperature, and one hot. After placing\none hand in the cold water and one in the hot water, the student is told\nto place both in the lukewarm water simultaneously. The look of amused\nbewilderment that immediately registers tells the story: Even though\nboth hands are in the same bucket, the hand that has been in the cold\nwater feels as if it is now in hot water, while the one that was in the hot\nwater feels as if it is now in cold water. The point is that the sameRobert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 9\nthing—in this instance, room-temperature water—can be made to seem\nvery different, depending on the nature of the event that precedes it.\nBe assured that the nice little weapon of influence provided by the\ncontrast principle does not go unexploited. The great advantage of this\nprinciple is not only that it works but also that it is virtually undetect-\nable. Those who employ it can cash in on its influence without any ap-\npearance of having structured the situation in their favor. Retail clothiers\nare a good example. Suppose a man enters a fashionable men’s store\nand says that he wants to buy a three-piece suit and a sweater. If you\nwere the salesperson, which would you show him first to make him\nlikely to spend the most money? Clothing stores instruct their sales\npersonnel to sell the costly item first. Common sense might suggest the\nreverse: If a man has just spent a lot of money to purchase a suit, he\nmay be reluctant to spend very much more on the purchase of a\nsweater. But the clothiers know better. They behave in accordance with\nwhat the contrast principle would suggest: Sell the suit first, because\nwhen it comes time to look at sweaters, even expensive ones, their prices\nwill not seem as high in comparison. A man might balk at the idea of\nspending $95 for a sweater, but if he has just bought a $495 suit, a $95\nsweater does not seem excessive. The same principle applies to a man\nwho wishes to buy the accessories (shirt, shoes, belt) to go along with\nhis new suit. Contrary to the commonsense view, the evidence supports\nthe contrast-principle prediction. As sales motivation analysts Whitney,\nHubin, and Murphy state, “The interesting thing is that even when a\nman enters a clothing store with the express purpose of purchasing a\nsuit, he will almost always pay more for whatever accessories he buys\nif he buys them after the suit purchase than before.”\nIt is much more profitable for salespeople to present the expensive\nitem first, not only because to fail to do so will lose the influence of the\ncontrast principle; to fail to do so will also cause the principle to work\nactively against them. Presenting an inexpensive product first and fol-\nlowing it with an expensive one will cause the expensive item to seem\neven more costly as a result—hardly a desirable consequence for most\nsales organizations. So, just as it is possible to make the same bucket of\nwater appear to be hotter or colder, depending on the temperature of\npreviously presented water, it is possible to make the price of the same\nitem seem higher or lower, depending on the price of a previously\npresented item.\nClever use of perceptual contrast is by no means confined to clothiers.\nI came across a technique that engaged the contrast principle while I\nwas investigating, undercover, the compliance tactics of real-estate\ncompanies. To “learn the ropes,” I was accompanying a company realty\nsalesman on a weekend of showing houses to prospective home buyers.10 / Influence\nThe salesman—we can call him Phil—was to give me tips to help me\nthrough my break-in period. One thing I quickly noticed was that\nwhenever Phil began showing a new set of customers potential buys,\nhe would start with a couple of undesirable houses. I asked him about\nit, and he laughed. They were what he called “setup” properties. The\ncompany maintained a run-down house or two on its lists at inflated\nprices. These houses were not intended to be sold to customers but to\nbe shown to them, so that the genuine properties in the company’s in-\nventory would benefit from the comparison. Not all the sales staff made\nuse of the setup houses, but Phil did. He said he liked to watch his\nprospects’ “eyes light up” when he showed the place he really wanted\nto sell them after they had seen the run-down houses. “The house I got\nthem spotted for looks really great after they’ve first looked at a couple\nof dumps.”\nAutomobile dealers use the contrast principle by waiting until the\nprice for a new car has been negotiated before suggesting one option\nafter another that might be added. In the wake of a fifteen-thousand-\ndollar deal, the hundred or so dollars required for a nicety like an FM\nradio seems almost trivial in comparison. The same will be true of the\nadded expense of accessories like tinted windows, dual side-view mir-\nrors, whitewall tires, or special trim that the salesman might suggest\nin sequence. The trick is to bring up the extras independently of one\nanother, so that each small price will seem petty when compared to the\nalready-determined much larger one. As the veteran car buyer can attest,\nmany a budget-sized final price figure has ballooned from the addition\nof all those seemingly little options. While the customer stands, signed\ncontract in hand, wondering what happened and finding no one to\nblame but himself, the car dealer stands smiling the knowing smile of\nthe jujitsu master.\nREADER’S REPORT\nFrom the Parent of a College Coed\nDear Mother and Dad:\nSince I left for college I have been remiss in writing and\nI am sorry for my thoughtlessness in not having written be-\nfore.

He sent Christmas cards to a sample of perfect strangers.\nAlthough he expected some reaction, the response he received was\namazing—holiday cards addressed to him came pouring back from the\npeople who had never met nor heard of him. The great majority of those\nwho returned a card never inquired into the identity of the unknown\nprofessor. They received his holiday greeting card, click, and, whirr,\nthey automatically sent one in return. While small in scope, this study\nnicely shows the action of one of the most potent of the weapons of in-\nfluence around us—the rule for reciprocation.1 The rule says that we\nshould try to repay, in kind, what another person has provided us. If\na woman does us a favor, we should do her one in return; if a man\nsends us a birthday present, we should remember his birthday with a\ngift of our own; if a couple invites us to a party, we should be sure to\ninvite them to one of ours. By virtue of the reciprocity rule, then, we\nare obligated to the future repayment of favors, gifts, invitations, and\nthe like. So typical is it for indebtedness to accompany the receipt of\nsuch things that a term like “much obliged” has become a synonym for\n“thank you,” not only in the English language but in others as well.\nThe impressive aspect of the rule for reciprocation and the sense of\nobligation that goes with it is its pervasiveness in human culture. It is\nso widespread that after intensive study, sociologists such as Alvin\nGouldner can report that there is no human society that does not sub-\nscribe to the rule.2 And within each society it seems pervasive also; it\npermeates exchanges of every kind. Indeed, it may well be that a de-\nveloped system of indebtedness flowing from the rule for reciprocation\nis a unique property of human culture. The noted archaeologist Richard\nLeakey ascribes the essence of what makes us human to the reciprocity\nsystem: “We are human because our ancestors learned to share their\nfood and their skills in an honored network of obligation,”3 he says.\nCultural anthropologists Lionel Tiger and Robin Fox view this “web of\nindebtedness” as a unique adaptive mechanism of human beings, al-\nlowing for the division of labor, the exchange of diverse forms of goods,\nthe exchange of different services (making it possible for experts to\ndevelop), and the creation of a cluster of interdependencies that bind\nindividuals together into highly efficient units.4\nIt is the future orientation inherent in a sense of obligation that is\ncritical to its ability to produce social advances of the sort described by\nTiger and Fox. A widely shared and strongly held feeling of future ob-\nligation made an enormous difference in human social evolution, be-\ncause it meant that one person could give something (for example, food,\nenergy, care) to another with confidence that it was not being lost. For\nthe first time in evolutionary history, one individual could give away\nany of a variety of resources without actually giving them away. The\nresult was the lowering of the natural inhibitions against transactions\nthat must be begun by one person’s providing personal resources to\nanother. Sophisticated and coordinated systems of aid, gift giving, de-\nfense, and trade became possible, bringing immense benefit to the soci-\neties that possessed them. With such clearly adaptive consequences for\nthe culture, it is not surprising that the rule for reciprocation is so deeply\nimplanted in us by the process of socialization we all undergo.\nI know of no better illustration of how reciprocal obligations can\nreach long and powerfully into the future than the perplexing story of\nfive thousand dollars of relief aid that was sent in 1985 between Mexico\nand the impoverished people of Ethiopia. In 1985 Ethiopia could justly\nlay claim to the greatest suffering and privation in the world. Its eco-\nnomy was in ruin. Its food supply had been ravaged by years of drought\nand internal war. Its inhabitants were dying by the thousands from\ndisease and starvation. Under these circumstances, I would not have\nbeen surprised to learn of a five-thousand-dollar relief donation from\nMexico to that wrenchingly needy country. I remember my chin hitting\nmy chest, though, when a brief newspaper item I was reading insisted\nthat the aid had gone in the opposite direction. Native officials of the\nEthiopian Red Cross had decided to send the money to help the victims\nof that year’s earthquakes in Mexico City.14 / Influence\nIt is both a personal bane and a professional blessing that whenever\nI am confused by some aspect of human behavior, I feel driven to in-\nvestigate further. In this instance, I was able to track down a fuller ac-\ncount of the story. Fortunately a journalist who had been as bewildered\nas I was by the Ethiopians’ action had asked for an explanation. The\nanswer he received offers eloquent validation of the reciprocity rule:\nDespite the enormous needs prevailing in Ethiopia, the money was\nbeing sent because Mexico had sent aid to Ethiopia in 1935, when it was\ninvaded by Italy. So informed, I remained awed, but I was no longer\npuzzled. The need to reciprocate had transcended great cultural differ-\nences, long distances, acute famine, and immediate self-interest. Quite\nsimply, a half century later, against all countervailing forces, obligation\ntriumphed.\nMake no mistake, human societies derive a truly significant compet-\nitive advantage from the reciprocity rule, and consequently they make\nsure their members are trained to comply with and believe in it. Each\nof us has been taught to live up to the rule, and each of us knows about\nthe social sanctions and derision applied to anyone who violates it. The\nlabels we assign to such a person are loaded with negativity—moocher,\ningrate, welsher. Because there is general distaste for those who take\nand make no effort to give in return, we will often go to great lengths\nto avoid being considered one of their number. It is to those lengths\nthat we will often be taken and, in the process, be “taken” by individuals\nwho stand to gain from our indebtedness.\nTo understand how the rule for reciprocation can be exploited by\none who recognizes it as the source of influence it certainly is, we might\nclosely examine an experiment performed by Professor Dennis Regan\nof Cornell University.5 A subject who participated in the study found\nhimself rating, along with another subject, the quality of some paintings\nas part of an experiment on “art appreciation.” The other rater—we can\ncall him Joe—was only posing as a fellow subject and was actually Dr.\nRegan’s assistant. For our purposes, the experiment took place under\ntwo different conditions. In some cases, Joe did a small, unsolicited favor\nfor the true subject. During a short rest period, he left the room for a\ncouple of minutes and returned with two bottles of Coca-Cola, one for\nthe subject and one for himself, saying, “I asked him [the experimenter]\nif I could get myself a Coke, and he said it was okay, so I bought one\nfor you, too.” In other cases, Joe did not provide the subject with a favor;\nhe simply returned from the two-minute break empty-handed. In all\nother respects, however, Joe behaved identically.\nLater on, after the paintings had all been rated and the experimenter\nhad momentarily left the room, Joe asked the subject to do him a favor.\nHe indicated that he was selling raffle tickets for a new car and that ifRobert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 15\nhe sold the most tickets, he would win a fifty-dollar prize. Joe’s request\nwas for the subject to buy some raffle tickets at twenty-five cents apiece:\n“Any would help, the more the better.” The major finding of the study\nconcerns the number of tickets subjects purchased from Joe under the\ntwo conditions. Without question, Joe was more successful in selling\nhis raffle tickets to the subjects who had received his earlier favor. Ap-\nparently feeling that they owed him something, these subjects bought\ntwice as many tickets as the subjects who had not been given the prior\nfavor. Although the Regan study represents a fairly simple demonstra-\ntion of the workings of the rule for reciprocation, it illustrates several\nimportant characteristics of the rule that, upon further consideration,\nhelp us to understand how it may be profitably used.\nThe Rule Is Overpowering\nOne of the reasons reciprocation can be used so effectively as a device\nfor gaining another’s compliance is its power. The rule possesses awe-\nsome strength, often producing a “yes” response to a request that, except\nfor an existing feeling of indebtedness, would have surely been refused.\nSome evidence of how the rule’s force can overpower the influence of\nother factors that normally determine whether a request will be com-\nplied with can be seen in a second result of the Regan study. Besides\nhis interest in the impact of the reciprocity rule on compliance, Regan\nwas also interested in how liking for a person affects the tendency to\ncomply with that person’s request. To measure how liking toward Joe\naffected the subjects’ decisions to buy his raffle tickets, Regan had them\nfill out several rating scales indicating how much they liked Joe. He\nthen compared their liking responses with the number of tickets they\nhad purchased from Joe. There was a significant tendency for subjects\nto buy more raffle tickets from Joe the more they liked him. But this\nalone is hardly a startling finding. Most of us would have guessed that\npeople are more willing to do a favor for someone they like.\nThe interesting thing about the Regan experiment, however, is that\nthe relationship between liking and compliance was completely wiped\nout in the condition under which subjects had been given a Coke by\nJoe. For those who owed him a favor, it made no difference whether\nthey liked him or not; they felt a sense of obligation to repay him, and\nthey did. The subjects in that condition who indicated that they disliked\nJoe bought just as many of his tickets as did those who indicated that\nthey liked him. The rule for reciprocity was so strong that it simply\noverwhelmed the influence of a factor—liking for the requester—that\nnormally affects the decision to comply.\nThink of the implications. People we might ordinarily dislike—unsa-16 / Influence\nvory or unwelcome sales operators, disagreeable acquaintances, repres-\nentatives of strange or unpopular organizations—can greatly increase\nthe chance that we will do what they wish merely by providing us with\na small favor prior to their requests. Let’s take an example that by now\nmany of us have encountered. The Hare Krishna Society is an Eastern\nreligious sect with centuries-old roots traceable to the Indian city of\nCalcutta. But its spectacular modern-day story occurred in the 1970s,\nwhen it experienced a remarkable growth not only in followers but also\nin wealth and property. The economic growth was funded through a\nvariety of activities, the principal and still most visible of which is the\nrequest for donations by Society members from passersby in public\nplaces. During the early history of the group in this country, the solicit-\nation for contributions was attempted in a fashion memorable for anyone\nwho saw it. Groups of Krishna devotees—often with shaved heads,\nand wearing ill-fitting robes, leg wrappings, beads, and bells—would\ncanvass a city street, chanting and bobbing in unison while begging for\nfunds.\nAlthough highly effective as a technique for gaining attention, this\nform of fund-raising did not work especially well. The average Amer-\nican considered the Krishnas weird, to say the least, and was reluctant\nto provide money to support them. It quickly became clear to the Society\nthat it had a considerable public-relations problem. The people being\nasked for contributions did not like the way the members looked,\ndressed, or acted. Had the Society been an ordinary commercial organ-\nization, the solution would have been simple—change the things the\npublic does not like. But the Krishnas are a religious organization; and\nthe way members look, dress, and act is partially tied to religious factors.\nBecause, in any denomination, religious factors are typically resistant\nto change because of worldly considerations, the Krishna leadership\nwas faced with a real dilemma. On the one hand were beliefs, modes\nof dress, and hairstyles that had religious significance. On the other\nhand, threatening the organization’s financial welfare, were the less-\nthan-positive feelings of the American public toward these things.\nWhat’s a sect to do?\nThe Krishnas’ resolution was brilliant. They switched to a fund-raising\ntactic that made it unnecessary for target persons to have positive feel-\nings toward the fund-raisers. They began to employ a donation-request\nprocedure that engaged the rule for reciprocation, which, as demon-\nstrated by the Regan study, is strong enough to overcome the factor of\ndislike for the requester. The new strategy still involves the solicitation\nof contributions in public places with much pedestrian traffic (airports\nare a favorite), but now, before a donation is requested, the target person\nis given a “gift”—a book (usually the Bhagavad Gita), the Back to GodheadRobert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 17\nmagazine of the Society, or, in the most cost-effective version, a flower.\nThe unsuspecting passerby who suddenly finds a flower pressed into\nhis hands or pinned to his jacket is under no circumstances allowed to\ngive it back, even if he asserts that he does not want it. “No, it is our\ngift to you,” says the solicitor, refusing to accept it. Only after the\nKrishna member has thus brought the force of the reciprocation rule to\nbear on the situation is the target asked to provide a contribution to the\nSociety. This benefactor-before-beggar strategy has been wildly success-\nful for the Hare Krishna Society, producing large-scale economic gains\nand funding the ownership of temples, businesses, houses, and property\nin 321 centers in the United States and overseas.\nAs an aside, it is instructive that the reciprocation rule has begun to\noutlive its usefulness for the Krishnas, not because the rule itself is any\nless potent societally, but because we have found ways to prevent the\nKrishnas from using it on us. After once falling victim to their tactic,\nmany travelers are now alert to the presence of robed Krishna Society\nsolicitors in airports and train stations, adjusting their paths to avoid\nan encounter and preparing beforehand to ward off a solicitor’s “gift.”\nAlthough the Society has tried to counter this increased vigilance by\ninstructing members to be dressed and groomed in modern styles to\navoid immediate recognition when soliciting (some actually carry flight\nbags or suitcases), even disguise has not worked especially well for\nthe Krishnas. Too many individuals now know better than to accept\nunrequested offerings in public places like airports. Furthermore,\nairport administrators have initiated a number of procedures designed\nto forewarn us of the Krishnas’ true identity and intent. Thus, it is now\ncommon airport practice to restrict the Krishnas’ soliciting activity to\ncertain areas of the airport and to announce through signs and the\npublic address system that the Krishnas are soliciting there. It is a test-\nament to the societal value of reciprocation that we have chosen to fight\nthe Krishnas mostly by seeking to avoid rather than to withstand the\nforce of their gift giving. The reciprocity rule that empowers their tactic\nis too strong—and socially beneficial—for us to want to violate it.\nPolitics is another arena in which the power of the reciprocity rule\nshows itself. Reciprocation tactics appear at every level:\n•At the top, elected officials engage in “logrolling” and the exchange\nof favors that makes politics the place of strange bedfellows, indeed.\nThe out-of-character vote of one of our elected representatives on a\nbill or measure can often be understood as a favor returned to the\nbill’s sponsor. Political analysts were amazed at Lyndon Johnson’s\nability to get so many of his programs through Congress during his\nearly administration. Even members of congress who were thought18 / Influence\nto be strongly opposed to the proposals were voting for them. Close\nexamination by political scientists has found the cause to be not so\nmuch Johnson’s political savvy as the large score of favors he had\nbeen able to provide to other legislators during his many years of\npower in the House and Senate. As President, he was able to produce\na truly remarkable amount of legislation in a short time by calling in\nthose favors. It is interesting that this same process may account for\nthe problems Jimmy Carter had in getting his programs through\nCongress during his early administration, despite heavy Democratic\nmajorities in both House and Senate. Carter came to the presidency\nfrom outside the Capitol Hill establishment. He campaigned on his\noutside-Washington identity, saying that he was indebted to no one\nthere. Much of his legislative difficulty upon arriving may be traced\nto the fact that no one there was indebted to him.\n•At another level, we can see the recognized strength of the reciprocity\nrule in the desire of corporations and individuals to provide judicial\nand legislative officials with gifts and favors, and in the series of\nlegal restrictions against such gifts and favors. Even with legitimate\npolitical contributions, the stockpiling of obligations often underlies\nthe stated purpose of supporting a favorite candidate. One look at\nthe lists of companies and organizations that contribute to the cam-\npaigns of both major candidates in important elections gives evidence\nof such motives. A skeptic, requiring direct evidence of the quid pro\nquo expected by political contributors, might look to the remarkably\nbald-faced admission by Charles H. Keating, Jr., who was later con-\nvicted on multiple counts of fraud in this country’s savings and loan\ndisaster. Addressing the question of whether a connection existed\nbetween the $1.3 million he had contributed to the campaigns of five\nU.S. senators and their subsequent actions in his behalf against federal\nregulators, he asserted, “I want to say in the most forceful way I can:\nI certainly hope so.”\n•At the grass-roots level, local political organizations have learned\nthat the principal way to keep their candidates in office is to make\nsure they provide a wide range of little favors to the voters. The “ward\nheelers” of many cities still operate effectively in this fashion. But\nordinary citizens are not alone in trading political support for small\npersonal favors. During the 1992 presidential primary campaign,\nactress Sally Kellerman was asked why she was lending her name\nand efforts to the candidacy of Democratic hopeful Jerry Brown. Her\nreply: “Twenty years ago, I asked ten friends to help me move. He\nwas the only one who showed up.”\nOf course, the power of reciprocity can be found in the merchandisingRobert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 19\nfield as well. Although the number of possible examples is large, let’s\nexamine a pair of familiar ones deriving from the “free sample.” As a\nmarketing technique, the free sample has a long and effective history.\nIn most instances, a small amount of the relevant product is provided\nto potential customers for the stated purpose of allowing them to try it\nto see if they like it. And certainly this is a legitimate desire of the\nmanufacturer—to expose the public to the qualities of the product. The\nbeauty of the free sample, however, is that it is also a gift and, as such,\ncan engage the reciprocity rule. In true jujitsu fashion, the promoter\nwho gives free samples can release the natural indebting force inherent\nin a gift while innocently appearing to have only the intention to inform.\nA favorite place for free samples is the supermarket, where customers\nare frequently provided with small cubes of a certain variety of cheese\nor meat to try. Many people find it difficult to accept a sample from the\nalways-smiling attendant, return only the toothpick, and walk away.\nInstead, they buy some of the product, even if they might not have liked\nit especially well. A highly effective variation on this marketing proced-\nure is illustrated in the case, cited by Vance Packard in The Hidden Per-\nsuaders, of the Indiana supermarket operator who sold an astounding\none thousand pounds of cheese in a few hours one day by putting out\nthe cheese and inviting customers to cut off slivers for themselves as\nfree samples.\nA different version of the free-sample tactic is used by the Amway\nCorporation, a rapid-growth company that manufactures and distributes\nhousehold and personal-care products in a vast national network of\ndoor-to-door neighborhood sales. The company, which has grown from\na basement-run operation a few years ago to a one-and-a-half-billion-\ndollar-yearly-sales business, makes use of the free sample in a device\ncalled the BUG. The BUG consists of a collection of Amway\nproducts—bottles of furniture polish, detergent, or shampoo, spray\ncontainers of deodorizers, insect killers, or window cleaners—carried\nto the customer’s home in a specially designed tray or just a polyethyl-\nene bag. The confidential Amway Career Manual then instructs the\nsalesperson to leave the BUG with the customer “for 24, 48, or 72 hours,\nat no cost or obligation to her. Just tell her you would like her to try the\nproducts…. That’s an offer no one can refuse.” At the end of the trial\nperiod, the Amway representative returns and picks up orders for those\nof the products the customer wishes to purchase. Since few customers\nuse up the entire contents of even one of the product containers in such\na short time, the salesperson may then take the remaining product\nportions in the BUG to the next potential customer down the line or\nacross the street and start the process again. Many Amway representat-\nives have several BUGs circulating in their districts at one time.20 / Influence\nOf course, by now you and I know that the customer who has accep-\nted and used the BUG products has been trapped into facing the influ-\nence of the reciprocity rule. Many such customers yield to a sense of\nobligation to order those of the salesperson’s products that they have\ntried and thereby partially consumed. And, of course, by now the Am-\nway Corporation knows that to be the case. Even in a company with\nas excellent a growth record as Amway, the BUG device has created a\nbig stir. Reports by state distributors to the parent company record a\nremarkable effect:\nUnbelievable! We’ve never seen such excitement. Product is\nmoving at an unbelievable rate, and we’ve only just begun….\n[Local] distributors took the BUGS, and we’ve had an unbelievable\nincrease in sales [from Illinois distributor]. The most fantastic retail\nidea we’ve ever had!…On the average, customers purchased about\nhalf the total amount of the BUG when it is picked up…. In one\nword, tremendous! We’ve never seen a response within our entire\norganization like this [from Massachusetts distributor].\nThe Amway distributors appear to be bewildered—happily so, but\nnonetheless bewildered—by the startling power of the BUG. Of course,\nby now you and I should not be.\nThe reciprocity rule governs many situations of a purely interpersonal\nnature where neither money nor commercial exchange is at issue. Per-\nhaps my favorite illustration of the enormous force available from the\nreciprocation weapon of influence comes from such a situation. The\nEuropean scientist, Eibl-Eibesfeldt, provides the account of a German\nsoldier during World War I whose job was to capture enemy soldiers\nfor interrogation. Because of the nature of the trench warfare at that\ntime, it was extremely difficult for armies to cross the no-man’s-land\nbetween opposing front lines; but it was not so difficult for a single\nsoldier to crawl across and slip into an enemy trench position. The\narmies of the Great War had experts who regularly did so to capture\nan enemy soldier, who would then be brought back for questioning.\nThe German expert of our account had often successfully completed\nsuch missions in the past and was sent on another. Once again, he\nskillfully negotiated the area between fronts and surprised a lone enemy\nsoldier in his trench. The unsuspecting soldier, who had been eating at\nthe time, was easily disarmed. The frightened captive with only a piece\nof bread in his hand then performed what may have been the most\nimportant act of his life. He gave his enemy some of the bread. So af-\nfected was the German by this gift that he could not complete his mis-\nsion. He turned from his benefactor and recrossed the no-man’s-land\nempty-handed to face the wrath of his superiors.Robert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 21\nAn equally compelling point regarding the power of reciprocity comes\nfrom an account of a woman who saved her life not by giving a gift as\ndid the captured soldier, but by refusing a gift and the powerful obliga-\ntions that went with it. The woman, Diane Louie, was an inhabitant of\nJonestown, Guyana, in November of 1978 when its leader, Jim Jones,\ncalled for the mass suicide of all residents, most of whom compliantly\ndrank and died from a vat of poison-laced Kool-Aid. Diane Louie,\nhowever, rejected Jones’s command and made her way out of Jonestown\nand into the jungle. She attributes her willingness to do so to her earlier\nrefusal to accept special favors from him when she was in need. She\nturned down his offer of special food while she was ill because “I knew\nonce he gave me those privileges, he’d have me. I didn’t want to owe\nhim nothin’.”\nThe Rule Enforces Uninvited Debts\nEarlier we suggested that the power of the reciprocity rule is such that\nby first doing us a favor, strange, disliked, or unwelcome others can\nenhance the chance that we will comply with one of their requests.\nHowever, there is another aspect of the rule, besides its power, that al-\nlows this phenomenon to occur. Another person can trigger a feeling\nof indebtedness by doing us an uninvited favor. Recall that the rule\nonly states that we should provide to others the kind of actions they\nhave provided us; it does not require us to have asked for what we have\nreceived in order to feel obligated to repay. For instance, the Disabled\nAmerican Veterans organization reports that its simple mail appeal for\ndonations produces a response rate of about 18 percent. But when the\nmailing also includes an unsolicited gift (gummed, individualized ad-\ndress labels), the success rate nearly doubles to 35 percent. This is not\nto say that we might not feel a stronger sense of obligation to return a\nfavor we have requested, only that such a request is not necessary to\nproduce our indebtedness.\nIf we reflect for a moment about the social purpose of the reciprocity\nrule, we can see why this should be so. The rule was established to\npromote the development of reciprocal relationships between individu-\nals so that one person could initiate such a relationship without the fear\nof loss. If the rule is to serve that purpose, then, an uninvited first favor\nmust have the ability to create an obligation. Recall, also, that reciprocal\nrelationships confer an extraordinary advantage upon cultures that\nfoster them and that, consequently, there will be strong pressures to\nensure that the rule does serve its purpose. Little wonder, then, that\nthe influential French anthropologist Marcel Mauss, in describing the\nsocial pressures surrounding the gift-giving process in human culture,22 / Influence\ncan state, “There is an obligation to give, an obligation to receive, and\nan obligation to repay.”6\nAlthough the obligation to repay constitutes the essence of the reci-\nprocity rule, it is the obligation to receive that makes the rule so easy\nto exploit. The obligation to receive reduces our ability to choose whom\nwe wish to be indebted to and puts that power in the hands of others.\nLet’s reexamine a pair of earlier examples to get a sense of how the\nprocess works. First, let’s return to the Regan study, where we find that\nthe favor causing subjects to double the number of raffle tickets pur-\nchased from Joe was not one they had requested. Joe had voluntarily\nleft the room and returned with one Coke for himself and one for the\nsubject. There was not a single subject who refused the Coke. It is easy\nto see why it would have been awkward to turn down Joe’s favor: Joe\nhad already spent his money; a soft drink was an appropriate favor in\nthe situation, especially since Joe had one himself; it would have been\nconsidered impolite to reject Joe’s thoughtful action. Nevertheless, re-\nceipt of that Coke produced an indebtedness that manifested itself\nclearly when Joe announced his desire to sell some raffle tickets. Notice\nthe important asymmetry here—all the genuinely free choices were\nJoe’s. He chose the form of the initial favor, and he chose the form of\nthe return favor. Of course, one could say that the subject had the choice\nof saying no to both of Joe’s offers. But those would have been tough\nchoices. To have said no at either point would have required the subject\nto go against the natural cultural forces favoring reciprocation arrange-\nments that Jujitsu Joe had aligned himself with.\nThe extent to which even an unwanted favor, once received, can\nproduce indebtedness is aptly illustrated in the soliciting technique of\nthe Hare Krishna Society. During systematic observation of the airport\nsoliciting strategy of the Krishnas, I have recorded a variety of responses\nfrom target persons. One of the most regular occurs as follows. An air-\nport visitor—a businessman, let’s say—is hurriedly walking along\nthrough a densely peopled area. The Krishna solicitor steps in front of\nhim and hands him a flower. The man, reacting with surprise, takes it.7\nAlmost immediately, he tries to give it back, saying that he does not\nwant the flower. The Krishna member responds that it is a gift from the\nKrishna Society and that it is the man’s to keep…however, a donation\nto further the Society’s good works would be appreciated. Again the\ntarget protests, “I don’t want this flower. Here, take it.” And again the\nsolicitor refuses, “It’s our gift to you, sir.” There is visible conflict on\nthe businessman’s face. Should he keep the flower and walk away\nwithout giving anything in return, or should he yield to the pressure\nof the deeply ingrained reciprocity rule and provide a contribution? By\nnow, the conflict has spread from his face to his posture. He leans awayRobert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 23\nfrom his benefactor, seemingly about to break free, only to be drawn\nback again by the pull of the rule. Once more his body tilts away, but\nit’s no use; he cannot disengage. With a nod of resignation, he fishes in\nhis pocket and comes up with a dollar or two that is graciously accepted.\nNow he can walk away freely, and he does, “gift” in hand, until he en-\ncounters a waste container—where he throws the flower.\nPurely by accident, I happened to witness a scene that demonstrates\nthat the Krishnas know very well how frequently their gifts are un-\nwanted by the people who receive them. While spending a day ob-\nserving a soliciting Krishna group at Chicago’s O’Hare International\nAirport a few years ago, I noticed that one of the group members would\nfrequently leave the central area and return with more flowers to resup-\nply her companions. As it happened, I had decided to take a break just\nas she was leaving on one of her supply missions. Having nowhere to\ngo, I followed. Her journey turned out to be a garbage route. She went\nfrom trash can to trash can beyond the immediate area to retrieve all\nthe flowers that had been discarded by Krishna targets. She then re-\nturned with the cache of recovered flowers (some that had been recycled\nwho knows how many times) and distributed them to be profitably\ncycled through the reciprocation process once more. The thing that\nreally impressed me about all this was that most of the discarded flowers\nhad brought donations from the people who had cast them away. The\nnature of the reciprocity rule is such that a gift so unwanted that it was\njettisoned at the first opportunity had nonetheless been effective and\nexploitable.\nThe ability of uninvited gifts to produce feelings of obligation is re-\ncognized by a variety of organizations besides the Krishnas. How many\ntimes have each of us received small gifts through the mail—personal-\nized address labels, greeting cards, key rings—from charity agencies\nthat ask for funds in an accompanying note? I have received five in just\nthe past year, two from disabled veterans’ groups and the others from\nmissionary schools or hospitals. In each case, there was a common\nthread in the accompanying message. The goods that were enclosed\nwere to be considered a gift from the organization; and any money I\nwished to send should not be regarded as payment but rather as a return\noffering. As the letter from one of the missionary programs stated, the\npacket of greeting cards I had been sent was not to be directly paid for,\nbut was designed “to encourage your kindness.” If we look past the\nobvious tax advantage, we can see a reason why it would be beneficial\nfor the organization to have the cards viewed as a gift instead of mer-\nchandise: There is a strong cultural pressure to reciprocate a gift, even\nan unwanted one; but there is no such pressure to purchase an unwanted\ncommercial product.24 / Influence\nThe Rule Can Trigger Unfair Exchanges\nThere is yet one other feature of the reciprocity rule that allows it to be\nexploited for profit. Paradoxically, the rule developed to promote equal\nexchanges between partners, yet it can be used to bring about decidedly\nunequal results. The rule demands that one sort of action be reciprocated\nwith a similar sort of action. A favor is to be met with another favor; it\nis not to be met with neglect, and certainly not with attack. But within\nthe similar-action boundaries, considerable flexibility is allowed. A\nsmall initial favor can produce a sense of obligation to agree to a sub-\nstantially larger return favor. Since, as we have already seen, the rule\nallows one person to choose the nature of the indebting first favor and\nthe nature of the debt-canceling return favor, we could easily be manip-\nulated into an unfair exchange by those who might wish to exploit the\nrule.\nOnce again, we can turn to the Regan experiment for evidence. Re-\nmember in that study that Joe gave one group of subjects a bottle of\nCoca-Cola as an initiating gift and later asked all subjects to buy some\nof his raffle tickets at twenty-five cents apiece. What I have so far neg-\nlected to mention is that the study was done in the late 1960s, when the\nprice of a Coke was a dime. The average subject who had been given a\nten-cent drink bought two of Joe’s raffle tickets, although some bought\nas many as seven. Even if we look just at the average subject, though,\nwe can tell that Joe made quite a deal. A 500 percent return on invest-\nment is respectable indeed!\nBut in Joe’s case, even a 500 percent return amounted to only fifty\ncents. Can the reciprocity rule produce meaningfully large differences\nin the sizes of the exchanged favors? Under the right circumstances, it\ncertainly can. Take, for instance, the account of a student of mine con-\ncerning a day she remembers ruefully:\nAbout one year ago, I couldn’t start my car. As I was sitting there,\na guy in the parking lot came over and eventually jump-started\nthe car. I said thanks, and he said you’re welcome; as he was\nleaving, I said that if he ever needed a favor to stop by. About a\nmonth later, the guy knocked on my door and asked to borrow\nmy car for two hours as his was in the shop. I felt somewhat oblig-\nated but uncertain, since the car was pretty new and he looked\nvery young. Later, I found out that he was underage and had no\ninsurance. Anyway, I lent him the car. He totaled it.\nHow could it happen that an intelligent young woman would agree\nto turn over her new car to a virtual stranger (and a youngster at that)Robert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 25\nbecause he had done her a small favor a month earlier? Or, more gen-\nerally, why should it be that small first favors often stimulate larger\nreturn favors? One important reason concerns the clearly unpleasant\ncharacter of the feeling of indebtedness. Most of us find it highly dis-\nagreeable to be in a state of obligation. It weighs heavily on us and de-\nmands to be removed. It is not difficult to trace the source of this feeling.\nBecause reciprocal arrangements are so vital in human social systems,\nwe have been conditioned to be uncomfortable when beholden. If we\nwere to ignore breezily the need to return another’s initial favor, we\nwould stop one reciprocal sequence dead and would make it less likely\nthat our benefactor would do such favors in the future. Neither event\nis in the best interests of society. Consequently, we are trained from\nchildhood to chafe, emotionally, under the saddle of obligation. For\nthis reason alone, then, we may be willing to agree to perform a larger\nfavor than we received, merely to relieve ourselves of the psychological\nburden of debt.\nBut there is another reason as well. A person who violates the reci-\nprocity rule by accepting without attempting to return the good acts of\nothers is actively disliked by the social group. The exception, of course,\nis when the person is prevented from repayment by reasons of circum-\nstance or ability. For the most part, however, there is a genuine distaste\nfor individuals who fail to conform to the dictates of the reciprocity\nrule.8 Moocher and welsher are unsavory labels to be scrupulously\nshunned. So undesirable are they that we will sometimes agree to an\nunequal exchange in order to dodge them.\nIn combination, the reality of internal discomfort and the possibility\nof external shame can produce a heavy psychological cost. When seen\nin the light of this cost, it is not so puzzling that we will often give back\nmore than we have received in the name of reciprocity. Neither is it so\nodd that, as was shown in an experiment conducted at the University\nof Pittsburgh, people will often avoid asking for a needed favor if they\nwill not be in a position to repay it. The psychological cost may simply\noutweigh the material loss.\nThe risk of still other kinds of losses may also persuade people to\ndecline certain gifts and benefits. Women frequently comment on the\nuncomfortable sense of obligation they can feel to return the favors of\na man who has given them an expensive present or paid for a costly\nevening out. Even something as small as the price of a drink can produce\na feeling of debt. A student in one of my classes expressed it quite\nplainly in a paper she wrote: “After learning the hard way, I no longer\nlet a guy I meet in a club buy my drinks because I don’t want either of\nus to feel that I am obligated sexually.” Research suggests that there is\na basis for her concern. If, instead of paying for them herself, a woman26 / Influence\nallows a man to buy her drinks, she is immediately judged (by both\nmen and women) as more sexually available to him.9\nRECIPROCAL CONCESSIONS\nThere is a second way to employ the reciprocity rule to get someone to\ncomply with a request. It is more subtle than the direct route of\nproviding that person with a favor and then asking for one in return;\nyet in some ways it is more devastatingly effective than the straightfor-\nward approach. A personal experience I had a few years ago gave me\nfirsthand evidence of just how well this compliance technique works.\nI was walking down the street when I was approached by an eleven-\nor twelve-year-old boy. He introduced himself and said that he was\nselling tickets to the annual Boy Scouts circus to be held on the upcoming\nSaturday night. He asked if I wished to buy any at five dollars apiece.\nSince one of the last places I wanted to spend Saturday evening was\nwith the Boy Scouts, I declined. “Well,” he said, “if you don’t want to\nbuy any tickets, how about buying some of our big chocolate bars?\nThey’re only a dollar each.” I bought a couple and, right away, realized\nthat something noteworthy had happened. I knew that to be the case\nbecause: (a) I do not like chocolate bars; (b) I do like dollars; (c) I was\nstanding there with two of his chocolate bars; and (d) he was walking\naway with two of my dollars.\nTo try to understand precisely what had happened, I went to my office\nand called a meeting of my research assistants. In discussing the situ-\nation, we began to see how the reciprocity rule was implicated in my\ncompliance with the request to buy the candy bars. The general rule\nsays that a person who acts in a certain way toward us is entitled to a\nsimilar return action. We have already seen that one consequence of\nthe rule is an obligation to repay favors we have received. Another\nconsequence of the rule, however, is an obligation to make a concession\nto someone who has made a concession to us. As my research group\nthought about it, we realized that was exactly the position the Boy Scout\nhad put me in. His request that I purchase some one-dollar chocolate\nbars had been put in the form of a concession on his part; it was\npresented as a retreat from his request that I buy some five-dollar tickets.\nIf I were to live up to the dictates of the reciprocation rule, there had to\nbe a concession on my part. As we have seen, there was such a conces-\nsion: I changed from noncompliant to compliant when he changed from\na larger to a smaller request, even though I was not really interested in\neither of the things he offered.\nIt was a classic example of how a weapon of automatic influence can\ninfuse a compliance request with its power. I had been moved to buyRobert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 27\nsomething not because of any favorable feelings toward the item, but\nbecause the purchase request had been presented in a way that drew\nforce from the reciprocity rule. It had not mattered that I do not like\nchocolate bars; the Boy Scout had made a concession to me, click, and,\nwhirr, I responded with a concession of my own. Of course, the tendency\nto reciprocate a concession is not so strong that it will invariably work\nin all instances on all people; none of the weapons of influence con-\nsidered in this book is that strong. However, in my exchange with the\nBoy Scout, the tendency had been sufficiently potent to leave me in\nmystified possession of a pair of unwanted and overpriced candy bars.\nWhy should I feel a strain to reciprocate a concession? The answer\nrests once again in the benefit of such a tendency to the society. It is in\nthe interests of any human group to have its members working together\ntoward the achievement of common goals. However, in many social\ninteractions the participants begin with requirements and demands\nthat are unacceptable to one another. Thus the society must arrange to\nhave these initial, incompatible desires set aside for the sake of socially\nbeneficial cooperation. This is accomplished through procedures that\npromote compromise. Mutual concession is one important such proced-\nure.\nThe reciprocation rule brings about mutual concession in two ways.\nThe first is obvious. It pressures the recipient of an already-made con-\ncession to respond in kind. The second, while not so obvious, is pivotally\nimportant. Just as in the case of favors, gifts, or aid, the obligation to\nreciprocate a concession encourages the creation of socially desirable\narrangements by ensuring that anyone seeking to start such an arrange-\nment will not be exploited. After all, if there were no social obligation\nto reciprocate a concession, who would want to make the first sacrifice?\nTo do so would be to risk giving up something and getting nothing\nback. However, with the rule in effect, we can feel safe making the first\nsacrifice to our partner, who is obligated to offer a return sacrifice.\nBecause the rule for reciprocation governs the compromise process,\nit is possible to use an initial concession as part of a highly effective\ncompliance technique. The technique is a simple one that we can call\nthe rejection-then-retreat technique. Suppose you want me to agree to\na certain request. One way to increase your chances would be first to\nmake a larger request of me, one that I will most likely turn down. Then,\nafter I have refused, you would make the smaller request that you were\nreally interested in all along. Provided that you have structured your\nrequests skillfully, I should view your second request as a concession\nto me and should feel inclined to respond with a concession of my own,28 / Influence\nthe only one I would have immediately open to me—compliance with\nyour second request.\nWas that how the Boy Scout got me to buy his candy bars? Was his\nretreat from the five-dollar request to the one-dollar request an artificial\none that was intentionally designed to sell candy bars? As one who has\nstill refused to discard even his first Scout merit badge, I genuinely\nhope not. But whether or not the large-request-then-smaller-request\nsequence was planned, its effect was the same, It worked. And because\nit works, the rejection-then-retreat technique can and will be used pur-\nposely by certain people to get their way. First let’s examine how this\ntactic can be used as a reliable compliance device. Later we will see how\nit is already being used. Finally we can turn to a pair of little-known\nfeatures of the technique that make it one of the most pervasively influ-\nential compliance tactics available.\nRemember that after my encounter with the Boy Scout, I called my\nresearch assistants together to try to understand what had happened\nto me and, as it turned out, to eat the evidence. Actually, we did more\nthan that. We designed an experiment to test the effectiveness of the\nprocedure of moving to a desired request after a larger preliminary re-\nquest had been refused. We had two primary purposes in conducting\nthe experiment. First, we wanted to see whether this procedure worked\non people besides myself. That is, it certainly seemed that the tactic had\nbeen effective when tried on me earlier in the day; but then, I have a\nhistory of falling for compliance tricks of all sorts. So the question re-\nmained, Does the rejection-then-retreat technique work on enough\npeople to make it a useful procedure for gaining compliance? If so, it\nwould definitely be something to be aware of in the future.\nOur second reason for doing the study was to determine how\npowerful a compliance device the technique was. Could it bring about\ncompliance with a genuinely sizable request? In other words, did the\nsmaller request to which the requester retreated have to be a small re-\nquest? If our thinking about what caused the technique to be effective\nwas correct, the second request did not actually have to be small; it only\nhad to be smaller than the initial one. It was our suspicion that the\ncritical thing about a requester’s retreat from a larger to a smaller favor\nwas its appearance as a concession. So the second request could be an\nobjectively large one—as long as it was smaller than the first re-\nquest—and the technique would still work.\nAfter a bit of thought, we decided to try the technique on a request\nthat we felt few people would agree to perform. Posing as representat-\nives of the “County Youth Counseling Program,” we approached college\nstudents walking on campus and asked if they would be willing to\nchaperon a group of juvenile delinquents on a day trip to the zoo. TheRobert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 29\nidea of being responsible for a group of juvenile delinquents of unspe-\ncified age for hours in a public place without pay was hardly an inviting\none for these students. As we expected, the great majority (83 percent)\nrefused. Yet we obtained very different results from a similar sample\nof college students who were asked the very same question with one\ndifference. Before we invited them to serve as unpaid chaperons on the\nzoo trip, we asked them for an even larger favor—to spend two hours\nper week as a counselor to a juvenile delinquent for a minimum of two\nyears. It was only after they refused this extreme request, as all did,\nthat we made the smaller, zoo-trip request. By presenting the zoo trip\nas a retreat from our initial request, our success rate increased dramat-\nically. Three times as many of the students approached in this manner\nvolunteered to serve as zoo chaperons.10\nBe assured that any strategy able to triple the percentage of compli-\nance with a substantial request (from 17 percent to 50 percent in our\nexperiment) will be frequently employed in a variety of natural settings.\nLabor negotiators, for instance, often use the tactic of beginning with\nextreme demands that they do not actually expect to win but from\nwhich they can retreat in a series of seeming concessions designed to\ndraw real concessions from the opposing side. It would appear, then,\nthat the larger the initial request, the more effective the procedure, since\nthere would be more room available for illusory concessions. This is\ntrue only up to a point, however. Research conducted at Bar-Ilan Uni-\nversity in Israel on the rejection-then-retreat technique shows that if\nthe first set of demands is so extreme as to be seen as unreasonable, the\ntactic backfires.11 In such cases, the party who has made the extreme\nfirst request is not seen to be bargaining in good faith. Any subsequent\nretreat from that wholly unrealistic initial position is not viewed as a\ngenuine concession and thus is not reciprocated. The truly gifted nego-\ntiator, then, is one whose initial position is exaggerated enough to allow\nfor a series of reciprocal concessions that will yield a desirable final offer\nfrom the opponent, yet is not so outlandish as to be seen as illegitimate\nfrom the start.\nIt seems that certain of the most successful television producers, such\nas Grant Tinker and Gary Marshall, are masters of this art in their nego-\ntiations with network censors. In a candid interview with TV Guide\nwriter Dick Russell, both admitted to “deliberately inserting lines into\nscripts that a censor’s sure to ax” so that they could then retreat to the\nlines they really wanted included. Marshall appears especially active\nin this regard. Consider, for example, the following quotes from Russell’s\narticle:30 / Influence\nBut Marshall…not only admits his tricks…he seems to revel in\nthem. On one episode of his [then] top-rated Laverne and Shirley\nseries, for example, he says, “We had a situation where Squiggy’s\nin a rush to get out of his apartment and meet some girls upstairs.\nHe says: ‘Will you hurry up before I lose my lust?’ But in the script\nwe put something even stronger, knowing the censors would cut\nit. They did; so we asked innocently, well, how about ‘lose my\nlust’? ‘That’s good,’ they said. Sometimes you gotta go at ’em\nbackward.”\nOn the Happy Days series, the biggest censorship fight was over\nthe word “virgin.” That time, says Marshall, “I knew we’d have\ntrouble, so we put the word in seven times, hoping they’d cut six\nand keep one. It worked. We used the same pattern again with\nthe word ‘pregnant.’”12\nI witnessed another form of the rejection-then-retreat technique in\nmy investigations of door-to-door sales operations. These organizations\nused a less engineered, more opportunistic version of the tactic. Of\ncourse, the most important goal for a door-to-door salesperson is to\nmake the sale. However, the training programs of each of the companies\nI investigated emphasized that a second important goal was to obtain\nfrom prospects the names of referrals—friends, relatives, or neighbors\non whom we could call. For a variety of reasons we will discuss in\nChapter 5, the percentage of successful door-to-door sales increases\nimpressively when the sales operator is able to mention the name of a\nfamiliar person who “recommended” the sales visit.\nNever as a sales trainee was I taught to get the sales pitch refused so\nthat I could then retreat to a request for referrals. In several such pro-\ngrams, though, I was trained to take advantage of the opportunity to\nsecure referrals offered by a customer’s purchase refusal: “Well, if it is\nyour feeling that a fine set of encyclopedias is not right for you at this\ntime, perhaps you could help me by giving me the names of some others\nwho might wish to take advantage of our company’s great offer. What\nwould be the names of some of these people you know?” Many indi-\nviduals who would not otherwise subject their friends to a high-pressure\nsales presentation do agree to supply referrals when the request is\npresented as a concession from a purchase request they have just re-\nfused.\nWe have already discussed one reason for the success of the rejection-\nthen-retreat technique—its incorporation of the reciprocity rule. This\nlarger-then-smaller-request strategy is effective for a pair of other\nreasons as well. The first concerns the perceptual contrast principle weRobert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 31\nencountered in Chapter 1. That principle accounted for, among other\nthings, the tendency of a man to spend more money on a sweater fol-\nlowing his purchase of a suit than before: After being exposed to the\nprice of the large item, the price of the less expensive one appears smaller\nby comparison. In the same way, the larger-then-smaller-request pro-\ncedure makes use of the contrast principle by making the smaller request\nlook even smaller by comparison with the larger one. If I want you to\nlend me five dollars, I can make it seem like a smaller request by first\nasking you to lend me ten dollars. One of the beauties of this tactic is\nthat by first requesting ten dollars and then retreating to five dollars, I\nwill have simultaneously engaged the force of the reciprocity rule and\nthe contrast principle. Not only will my five-dollar request be viewed\nas a concession to be reciprocated, it will also look to you like a smaller\nrequest than if I had just asked for it straightaway.\nIn combination, the influences of reciprocity and perceptual contrast\ncan present a fearsomely powerful force. Embodied in the rejection-\nthen-retreat sequence, their conjoined energies are capable of genuinely\nastonishing effects. It is my feeling that they provide the only really\nplausible explanation of one of the most baffling political actions of our\ntime: the decision to break into the Watergate offices of the Democratic\nNational Committee that led to the ruin of Richard Nixon’s presidency.\nOne of the participants in that decision, Jeb Stuart Magruder, upon first\nhearing that the Watergate burglars had been caught, responded with\nappropriate bewilderment, “How could we have been so stupid?” In-\ndeed, how?\nTo understand how enormously ill conceived an idea it was for the\nNixon administration to undertake the break-in, it is necessary to review\na few facts:\n•The idea was that of G. Gordon Liddy, who was in charge of intelli-\ngence-gathering operations for the Committee to Re-elect the Presid-\nent (CRP). Liddy had gained a reputation among administration\nhigher-ups as something of a flake, and there were questions about\nhis stability and judgment.\n•Liddy’s proposal was extremely costly, requiring a budget of $250,000\nin untraceable cash.\n•In late March, when the proposal was approved in a meeting of the\nCRP director, John Mitchell, and his assistants Magruder and Freder-\nick LaRue, the outlook for a Nixon victory in the November election\ncould not have been brighter. Edmund Muskie, the only announced\ncandidate the early polls had given a chance of unseating the Presid-\nent, had done poorly in the primaries. It looked very much as though32 / Influence\nthe most defeatable candidate, George McGovern, would win his\nparty’s nomination. A Republican victory seemed assured.\n•The break-in plan itself was a highly risky operation requiring the\nparticipation and discretion of ten men.\n•The Democratic National Committee and its chairman, Lawrence\nO’Brien, whose Watergate office was to be burglarized and bugged,\nhad no information damaging enough to defeat the incumbent Pres-\nident. Nor were they likely to get any, unless the administration did\nsomething very, very foolish.\nDespite the obvious counsel of the above reasons, the expensive,\nchancy, pointless, and potentially calamitous proposal of a man whose\njudgment was known to be questionable was approved. How could it\nbe that intelligent men of the attainment of Mitchell and Magruder\nwould do something so very, very foolish? Perhaps the answer lies in a\nlittle-discussed fact: The $250,000 plan they approved was not Liddy’s\nfirst proposal. In fact, it represented a significant concession on his part\nfrom two earlier proposals, of immense proportions. The first of these\nplans, made two months earlier in a meeting with Mitchell, Magruder,\nand John Dean, described a $I million program that included (in addition\nto the bugging of the Watergate) a specially equipped communications\n“chase plane,” break-ins, kidnapping and mugging squads, and a yacht\nfeaturing “high-class call girls” to blackmail Democratic politicians. A\nsecond Liddy plan, presented a week later to the same group of Mitchell,\nMagruder, and Dean, eliminated some of the program and reduced the\ncost to $500,000. It was only after these initial proposals had been rejec-\nted by Mitchell that Liddy submitted his “bare-bones” $250,000 plan,\nin this instance to Mitchell, Magruder, and Frederick LaRue. This time\nthe plan, still stupid but less so than the previous ones, was approved.\nCould it be that I, a longtime patsy, and John Mitchell, a hardened\nand canny politician, might both have been so easily maneuvered into\nbad deals by the same compliance tactic—I by a Boy Scout selling candy,\nand he by a man selling political disaster?\nIf we examine the testimony of Jeb Magruder, considered by most\nWatergate investigators to provide the most faithful account of the\ncrucial meeting at which Liddy’s plan was finally accepted, there are\nsome instructive clues. First, Magruder reports that “no one was partic-\nularly overwhelmed with the project”; but “after starting at the grandi-\nose sum of $1 million, we thought that probably $250,000 would be an\nacceptable figure…. We were reluctant to send him away with nothing.”\nMitchell, caught up in the “feeling that we should leave Liddy a little\nsomething…signed off on it in the sense of saying, ‘Okay, let’s give him\na quarter of a million dollars and let’s see what he can come up with.’”Robert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 33\nIn the context of Liddy’s initial extreme requests, it seems that “a\nquarter of a million dollars” had come to be “a little something” to be\nleft as a return concession. With the clarity afforded by hindsight, Ma-\ngruder has recalled Liddy’s approach in as succinct an illustration of\nthe rejection-then-retreat technique as I have ever heard. “If he had\ncome to us at the outset and said, ‘I have a plan to burglarize and\nwiretap Larry O’Brien’s office,’ we might have rejected the idea out of\nhand. Instead he came to us with his elaborate call-girl/kidnap-\nping/mugging/sabotage/wiretapping scheme…. He had asked for the\nwhole loaf when he was quite content to settle for half or even a\nquarter.”13\nIt is also instructive that, although he finally deferred to his boss’s\ndecision, only one member of the group, Frederick LaRue, expressed\nany direct opposition to the proposal. Saying with obvious common\nsense, “I don’t think it’s worth the risk,” he must have wondered why\nhis colleagues Mitchell and Magruder did not share his perspective. Of\ncourse, there could be many differences between LaRue and the other\ntwo men that may have accounted for their differing opinions regarding\nthe advisability of Liddy’s plan. But one stands out: Of the three, only\nLaRue had not been present at the prior two meetings, where Liddy\nhad outlined his much more ambitious programs. Perhaps, then, only\nLaRue was able to see the third proposal for the clunker that it was and\nto react to it objectively, uninfluenced by the reciprocity and perceptual\ncontrast forces acting upon the others.\nA bit earlier we said that the rejection-then-retreat technique had, in\naddition to the reciprocity rule, a pair of other factors working in its\nfavor. We have already discussed the first of those factors, the percep-\ntual contrast principle. The additional advantage of the technique is\nnot really a psychological principle, as in the case of the other two\nfactors; it is more of a purely structural feature of the request sequence.\nLet’s once again say that I wish to borrow five dollars from you. By\nbeginning with a ten-dollar request, I really can’t lose. If you agree to\nit, I will have gotten twice the amount from you I would have settled\nfor. If, on the other hand, you turn down my initial request, I can retreat\nto the five-dollar favor that I desired from the outset and, through the\naction of the reciprocity and contrast principles, greatly enhance my\nlikelihood of success. Either way, I benefit; it’s a case of heads I win,\ntails you lose.\nThe clearest utilization of this aspect of the larger-then-smaller-request\nsequence occurs in the retail-store sales practice of “talking the top of\nthe line.” Here the prospect is invariably shown the deluxe model first.\nIf the customer buys, there is frosting on the store’s cake. However, if\nthe customer declines, the salesperson effectively counteroffers with a34 / Influence\nmore reasonably priced model. Some proof of the effectiveness of this\nprocedure comes from a report in Sales Management magazine, reprinted\nwithout comment in Consumer Reports:\nIf you were a billiard-table dealer, which would you advertise—the\n$329 model or the $3,000 model? The chances are you would pro-\nmote the low-priced item and hope to trade the customer up when\nhe comes to buy. But G. Warren Kelley, new business promotion\nmanager at Brunswick, says you could be wrong…. To prove his\npoint, Kelley has actual sales figures from a representative store….\nDuring the first week, customers…were shown the low end of the\nline…and then encouraged to consider more expensive mod-\nels—the traditional trading-up approach…. The average table sale\nthat week was $550…. However, during the second week, custom-\ners…were led instantly to a $3,000 table, regardless of what they\nwanted to see…and then allowed to shop the rest of the line, in\ndeclining order of price and quality. The result of selling down\nwas an average sale of over $1,000.14\nGiven the remarkable effectiveness of the rejection-then-retreat\ntechnique, one might think that there could be a substantial disadvant-\nage as well. The victims of the strategy might resent having been\ncornered into compliance. The resentment could show itself in a couple\nof ways. First, the victim might decide not to live up to the verbal\nagreement made with the requester. Second, the victim might come to\ndistrust the manipulative requester, deciding never to deal with him\nagain. If either or both of these events occurred with any frequency, a\nrequester would want to give serious second thought to the use of the\nrejection-then-retreat procedure. Research indicates, however, that these\nvictim reactions do not occur with increased frequency when the rejec-\ntion-then-retreat technique is used. Somewhat astonishingly, it appears\nthat they actually occur less frequently! Before trying to understand\nwhy this is the case, let’s first look at the evidence.\nA study published in Canada throws light on the question of\nwhether a victim of the rejection-then-retreat tactic will follow through\nwith the agreement to perform the requester’s second favor. In addition\nto recording whether target persons said yes or no to the desired request\n(to work for two unpaid hours one day in a community mental-health\nagency), this experiment also recorded whether they showed up to\nperform their duties as promised. As usual, the procedure of starting\nwith a larger request (to volunteer for two hours of work per week in\nthe agency for at least two years) produced more verbal agreement to\nthe smaller retreat request (76 percent) than did the procedure of asking\nfor the smaller request alone (29 percent). The important result, though,Robert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 35\nconcerned the show-up rate of those who volunteered; and, again, the re-\njection-then-retreat procedure was the more effective one (85 percent\nvs. 50 percent).15\nA different experiment examined whether the rejection-then-retreat\nsequence caused victims to feel so manipulated that they would refuse\nany further requests. In this study, the targets were college students\nwho were each asked to give a pint of blood as part of the annual cam-\npus blood drive. One group of targets was first asked to give a pint of\nblood every six weeks for a minimum of three years. The other targets\nwere asked only to give the single pint of blood. Those of both groups\nwho agreed to give a pint of blood and who later appeared at the blood\ncenter were then asked if they would be willing to give their phone\nnumbers so they could be called upon to donate again in the future.\nNearly all the students who were about to give a pint of blood as a\nresult of the rejection-then-retreat technique agreed to donate again\nlater (84 percent), while less than half of the other students who ap-\npeared at the blood center did so (43 percent). Even for future favors,\nthe rejection-then-retreat strategy proved superior.16\nStrangely enough, then, it seems that the rejection-then-retreat tactic\nspurs people not only to agree to a desired request but actually to carry\nout the request and, finally, to volunteer to perform further requests.\nWhat could there be about the technique that makes people who have\nbeen duped into compliance so bewilderingly likely to continue to\ncomply? For an answer, we might look at the requester’s act of conces-\nsion, which is the heart of the procedure. We have already seen that as\nlong as it is not viewed to be a transparent trick, the concession will\nlikely stimulate a return concession. But what we have not yet examined\nis a little-known pair of positive by-products of the act of concession:\nfeelings of greater responsibility for, and satisfaction with, the arrange-\nment. It is this set of sweet side effects that enables the technique to\nmove its victims to fulfill their agreements and to engage in further\nsuch agreements.\nThe desirable side effects of making a concession during an interaction\nwith another person are nicely shown in studies of the way people\nbargain with each other. One experiment, conducted by social psycho-\nlogists at UCLA, offers an especially apt demonstration.17 A subject in\nthat study faced a “negotiation opponent” and was told to bargain with\nthe opponent concerning how to divide between themselves a certain\namount of money provided by the experimenters. The subject was also\ninformed that if no mutual agreement could be reached after a certain\nperiod of bargaining, no one would get any money. Unknown to the\nsubjects, the opponent was really an experimental assistant who had36 / Influence\nbeen previously instructed to bargain with the subject in one of three\nways. With some of the subjects, the opponent made an extreme first\ndemand, assigning virtually all of the money to himself, and stubbornly\npersisted in that demand throughout the negotiations. With another\ngroup of subjects, the opponent began with a demand that was moder-\nately favorable to himself; he, too, steadfastly refused to move from\nthat position during the negotiations. With a third group, the opponent\nbegan with the extreme demand and then gradually retreated to the\nmore moderate one during the course of the bargaining.\nThere were three important findings in this experiment that help us\nto understand why the rejection-then-retreat technique is so effective.\nFirst, compared to the two other approaches, the strategy of starting\nwith an extreme demand and then retreating to the more moderate one\nproduced the most money for the person using it. But this result is not\nvery surprising in light of the previous evidence we have seen of the\npower of larger-then-smaller-request tactics to bring about profitable\nagreements. It is the two additional findings of the study that are more\nstriking.\nResponsibility. Those subjects facing the opponent who used the re-\ntreating strategy felt most responsible for the final deal. Much more\nthan the subjects who faced a nonchanging negotiation opponent, these\nsubjects reported that they had successfully influenced the opponent\nto take less money for himself. Of course, we know that they hadn’t\ndone any such thing. The experimenter had instructed their opponent\nto retreat gradually from his initial demand no matter what the subjects\ndid. But it appeared to these subjects that they had made the opponent\nchange, that they had produced his concessions. The result was that they\nfelt more responsible for the final outcome of the negotiations. It does\nnot require much of a leap from this finding to clarify the previous\nmystery of why the rejection-then-retreat technique causes its targets\nto live up to their agreements with such astounding frequency. The re-\nquester’s concession within the technique not only causes targets to say\nyes more often, it also causes them to feel more responsible for having\n“dictated” the final agreement. Thus the uncanny ability of the rejection-\nthen-retreat technique to make its targets meet their commitments be-\ncomes understandable: A person who feels responsible for the terms\nof a contract will be more likely to live up to that contract.\nSatisfaction. Even though, on the average, they gave the most money\nto the opponent who used the concessions strategy, the subjects who\nwere the targets of this strategy were the most satisfied with the final\narrangement. It appears that an agreement that has been forged through\nthe concessions of one’s opponent is quite satisfying. With this in mind,\nwe can begin to explain the second previously puzzling feature of theRobert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 37\nrejection-then-retreat tactic—the ability to prompt its victims to agree\nto further requests. Since the tactic uses a concession to bring about\ncompliance, the victim is likely to feel more satisfied with the arrange-\nment as a result. And it stands to reason that people who are satisfied\nwith a given arrangement are more likely to be willing to agree to further\nsuch arrangements.\nHOW TO SAY NO\nWhen up against a requester who employs the rule for reciprocation,\nyou and I face a formidable foe. Whether by presenting us with an initial\nfavor or initial concession, the requester will have enlisted a powerful\nally in the campaign for our compliance. At first glance, our fortunes\nin such a situation would appear dismal. We could comply with the\nrequester’s wish and, in so doing, succumb to the reciprocity rule. Or,\nwe could refuse to comply and thereby suffer the brunt of the rule’s\nforce upon our deeply conditioned feelings of fairness and obligation.\nSurrender or suffer heavy casualties. Cheerless prospects indeed.\nFortunately, these are not our only choices. With the proper under-\nstanding of the nature of our opponent, we can come away from the\ncompliance battlefield unhurt and sometimes even better off than before.\nIt is essential to recognize that the requester who invokes the reciproc-\nation rule (or any other weapon of influence) to gain our compliance is\nnot the real opponent. Such a requester has chosen to become a jujitsu\nwarrior who aligns himself with the sweeping power of reciprocation\nand then merely releases that power by providing a first favor or con-\ncession. The real opponent is the rule. If we are not to be abused by it,\nwe must take steps to defuse its energy.\nBut how does one go about neutralizing the effect of a social rule like\nthat for reciprocation? It seems too widespread to escape and too strong\nto overpower once it is activated. Perhaps the answer, then, is to prevent\nits activation. Perhaps we can avoid a confrontation with the rule by\nrefusing to allow the requester to commission its force against us in the\nfirst place. Perhaps by rejecting the requester’s initial favor or concession\nto us, we can evade the problem. Perhaps; but then, perhaps not. Invari-\nably declining the requester’s initial offer of a favor or sacrifice works\nbetter in theory than in practice. The major problem is that when it is\nfirst presented, it is difficult to know whether such an offer is honest\nor whether it is the initial step in an exploitation attempt. If we always\nassume the worst, it would not be possible to receive the benefits of\nany legitimate favors or concessions offered by individuals who had\nno intention of exploiting the reciprocity rule.\nI have a colleague who remembers with anger how his ten-year-old38 / Influence\ndaughter’s feelings were terribly hurt by a man whose method of\navoiding the jaws of the reciprocity rule was to refuse abruptly her\nkindness. The children of her class were hosting an open house at school\nfor their grandparents, and her job was to give a flower to each visitor\nentering the school grounds. But the first man she approached with a\nflower growled at her, “Keep it.” Not knowing what to do, she extended\nit toward him again only to have him demand to know what he had to\ngive in return. When she replied weakly, “Nothing. It’s a gift,” he fixed\nher with a disbelieving glare, insisted that he recognized “her game,”\nand brushed on past. The girl was so stung by the experience that she\ncould not approach anyone else and had to be removed from her assign-\nment—one she had anticipated fondly. It is hard to know whom to\nblame more here, the insensitive man or the exploiters who had abused\nhis mechanical tendency to reciprocate a gift until his response had\nsoured to a mechanical refusal. No matter whom you find more\nblameworthy, the lesson is clear. We will always encounter authentically\ngenerous individuals as well as many people who try to play fairly by\nthe reciprocity rule rather than to exploit it. They will doubtless become\ninsulted by someone who consistently rejects their efforts; social friction\nand isolation could well result. A policy of blanket rejection, then, seems\nill advised.\nAnother solution holds more promise. It advises us to accept the de-\nsirable first offers of others but to accept those offers only for what they\nfundamentally are, not for what they are represented to be. If a person\noffers us a nice favor, let’s say, we might well accept, recognizing that\nwe have obligated ourselves to a return favor sometime in the future.\nTo engage in this sort of arrangement with another is not to be exploited\nby that person through the rule for reciprocation. Quite the contrary;\nit is to participate fairly in the “honored network of obligation” that\nhas served us so well, both individually and societally, from the dawn\nof humanity. However, if the initial favor turns out to be a device, a\ntrick, an artifice designed specifically to stimulate our compliance with\na larger return favor, that is a different story. Here our partner is not a\nbenefactor but a profiteer. And it is here that we should respond to his\naction on precisely those terms. Once we have determined that his initial\noffer was not a favor but a compliance tactic, we need only react to it\naccordingly to be free of its influence. As long as we perceive and define\nhis action as a compliance device instead of a favor, he no longer has\nthe reciprocation rule as an ally: The rule says that favors are to be met\nwith favors; it does not require that tricks be met with favors.\nA practical example may make things more concrete. Let’s suppose\nthat a woman phoned one day and introduced herself as a member ofRobert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 39\nthe Home Fire Safety Association in your town. Suppose she then asked\nif you would be interested in learning about home fire safety, having\nyour house checked for fire hazards, and receiving a home fire extin-\nguisher, all free of charge. Let’s suppose further that you were interested\nin these things and made an evening appointment to have one of the\nAssociation’s inspectors come over to provide them. When he arrived,\nhe gave you a small hand extinguisher and began examining the possible\nfire hazards of your home. Afterward, he gave you some interesting,\nthough frightening, information about general fire dangers, along with\nan assessment of your home’s vulnerability. Finally, he suggested that\nyou get a home fire-warning system and left.\nSuch a set of events is not implausible. Various cities and towns have\nnonprofit associations, usually made up of Fire Department personnel\nworking on their own time, that provide free home fire-safety inspec-\ntions of this sort. Were these events to occur, you would clearly have\nbeen done a favor by the inspector. In accordance with the reciprocation\nrule, you should stand more ready to provide a return favor if you were\nto see him in need of aid at some point in the future. An exchange of\nfavors of this kind would be in the best tradition of the reciprocity rule.\nA similar set of events with, however, a different ending would also\nbe possible—in fact, more likely. Rather than leaving after recommend-\ning a fire-alarm system, the inspector would launch into a sales\npresentation intended to persuade you to buy an expensive, heat-\ntriggered alarm system manufactured by the company he represented.\nDoor-to-door home fire-alarm companies will frequently use this ap-\nproach. Typically, their product, while effective enough, will be over-\npriced. Trusting that you will not be familiar with the retail costs of\nsuch a system and that, if you decide to buy one, you will feel obligated\nto the company that provided you with a free extinguisher and home\ninspection, these companies will pressure you for an immediate sale.\nUsing this free-information-and-inspection gambit, fire-protection sales\norganizations have flourished around the country.18\nIf you were to find yourself in such a situation with the realization\nthat the primary motive of the inspector’s visit was to sell you a costly\nalarm system, your most effective next action would be a simple, private\nmaneuver. It would involve the mental act of redefinition. Merely define\nwhatever you have received from the inspector—extinguisher, safety\ninformation, hazard inspection—not as gifts, but as sales devices, and\nyou will be free to decline (or accept) his purchase offer without even\na tug from the reciprocity rule: A favor rightly follows a favor—not a\npiece of sales strategy. And if he subsequently responds to your refusal\nby proposing that you, at least, give him the names of some friends he\nmight call on, use your mental maneuver on him again. Define his retreat40 / Influence\nto this smaller request as what (it is hoped after reading this chapter)\nyou recognize it to be—a compliance tactic. Once done, there would be\nno pressure to offer the names as a return concession, since his reduced\nrequest would not be viewed as a real concession. At this point, un-\nhampered by an inappropriately triggered sense of obligation, you may\nonce again be as compliant or noncompliant as you wish.\nProvided you are so inclined, you might even turn his own weapon\nof influence against him. Recall that the rule for reciprocation entitles\na person who has acted in a certain way to a dose of the same thing. If\nyou have determined that the “fire inspector’s” gifts were used, not as\ngenuine gifts, but to make a profit from you, then you might want to\nuse them to make a profit of your own. Simply take whatever the in-\nspector is willing to provide—safety information, home extinguish-\ner—thank him politely, and show him out the door. After all, the reci-\nprocity rule asserts that if justice is to be done, exploitation attempts\nshould be exploited.\nREADER’S REPORT\nFrom a Former TV and Stereo Salesperson\n“For quite a while, I worked for a major retailer in their Television and\nStereo Department. Salespeople in this department are paid on a com-\nmission basis; however, continued employment was, and still is, based\non the ability to sell service contracts rather than merchandise. Company\npolicy was that, for every ten sales you made, you had to sell at least\nfour service contracts. Failure to bring your service-contract sales up\nto expected levels for two consecutive months resulted in threats, relo-\ncation, or termination.\n“Once I recognized the importance of meeting my sales-contract\nquota, I devised a plan that used the rejection-then-retreat technique,\nalthough I didn’t know its name at the time: A customer had the oppor-\ntunity to buy from one to three years’ worth of service-contract coverage\nat the time of the sale. Most of the sales staff attempted just to sell a\nsingle-year policy. That was my intention as well, since a one-year\ncontract counted just as much toward my quota as a three-year contract\ndid. Initially, however, when making my sales pitch, I would advocate\nthe longest and most expensive plan, realizing that most people would\nnot be willing to spend that much (about $140). But this gave me an\nexcellent opportunity later, after being rejected in my sincere attempt\nto sell the three-year plan, to retreat to the one-year extension and its\nrelatively small $34.95 price, which I was thrilled to get. This proved\nhighly effective, as I sold sales contracts to an average of seventy percent\nof my customers, who seemed very satisfied with the purchase whileRobert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 41\nothers in my department clustered around forty percent. I never told\nanyone how I did it until now.”\nNotice how, as is usually the case, use of the rejection-then-retreat\ntactic engages the action of the contrast principle as well. Not only did\nthe $140 initial request make the $34.95 request seem like a retreat, it\nmade that second request seem smaller too.42 / Influence\nChapter 3\nCOMMITMENT AND\nCONSISTENCY\nHobgoblins of the Mind\nIt is easier to resist at the beginning than at the end.\n—LEONARDO DA VINCI\nASTUDY DONE BY A PAIR OF CANADIAN PSYCHOLOGISTS UNCOVERED\nsomething fascinating about people at the racetrack: Just after\nplacing a bet, they are much more confident of their horse’s chances of\nwinning than they are immediately before laying down that bet.1 Of\ncourse, nothing about the horse’s chances actually shifts; it’s the same\nhorse, on the same track, in the same field; but in the minds of those\nbettors, its prospects improve significantly once that ticket is purchased.\nAlthough a bit puzzling at first glance, the reason for the dramatic\nchange has to do with a common weapon of social influence. Like the\nother weapons of influence, this one lies deep within us, directing our\nactions with quiet power. It is, quite simply, our nearly obsessive desire\nto be (and to appear) consistent with what we have already done. Once\nwe have made a choice or taken a stand, we will encounter personal\nand interpersonal pressures to behave consistently with that commit-\nment. Those pressures will cause us to respond in ways that justify our\nearlier decision.\nTake the bettors in the racetrack experiment. Thirty seconds before\nputting down their money, they had been tentative and uncertain; thirty\nseconds after the deed, they were significantly more optimistic and self-\nassured. The act of making a final decision—in this case, of buying a\nticket—had been the critical factor. Once a stand had been taken, the\nneed for consistency pressured these people to bring what they felt and\nbelieved into line with what they had already done. They simply con-\nvinced themselves that they had made the right choice and, no doubt,\nfelt better about it all.\nBefore we see such self-delusion as unique to racetrack habitués, we\nshould examine the story of my neighbor Sara and her live-in boyfriend,\nTim. They met at a hospital where he worked as an X-ray technician\nand she as a nutritionist. They dated for a while, even after Tim lost his\njob, and eventually they moved in together. Things were never perfect\nfor Sara: She wanted Tim to marry her and to stop his heavy drinking;\nTim resisted both ideas. After an especially difficult period of conflict,\nSara broke off the relationship, and Tim moved out. At the same time,\nan old boyfriend of Sara’s returned to town after years away and called\nher. They started seeing each other socially and quickly became serious\nenough to plan a wedding. They had gone so far as to set a date and\nissue invitations when Tim called. He had repented and wanted to\nmove back in. When Sara told him her marriage plans, he begged her\nto change her mind; he wanted to be together with her as before. But\nSara refused, saying she didn’t want to live like that again. Tim even\noffered to marry her, but she still said she preferred the other boyfriend.\nFinally, Tim volunteered to quit drinking if she would only relent.\nFeeling that under those conditions Tim had the edge, Sara decided to\nbreak her engagement, cancel the wedding, retract the invitations, and\nlet Tim move back in with her.\nWithin a month, Tim informed Sara that he didn’t think he needed\nto stop his drinking after all; a month later, he had decided that they\nshould “wait and see” before getting married. Two years have since\npassed; Tim and Sara continue to live together exactly as before. He\nstill drinks, there are still no marriage plans, yet Sara is more devoted\nto Tim than she ever was. She says that being forced to choose taught\nher that Tim really is number one in her heart. So, after choosing Tim\nover her other boyfriend, Sara became happier with him, even though\nthe conditions under which she had made her choice have never been\nfulfilled. Obviously, horse-race bettors are not alone in their willingness\nto believe in the correctness of a difficult choice, once made. Indeed,\nwe all fool ourselves from time to time in order to keep our thoughts\nand beliefs consistent with what we have already done or decided.\nPsychologists have long understood the power of the consistency\nprinciple to direct human action. Prominent theorists such as Leon\nFestinger, Fritz Hieder, and Theodore Newcomb have viewed the desire\nfor consistency as a central motivator of our behavior. But is this tend-44 / Influence\nency to be consistent really strong enough to compel us to do what we\nordinarily would not want to do? There is no question about it. The\ndrive to be (and look) consistent constitutes a highly potent weapon of\nsocial influence, often causing us to act in ways that are clearly contrary\nto our own best interests.\nTake, as proof, what happened when psychologist Thomas Moriarty\nstaged thefts on a New York City beach to see if onlookers would risk\npersonal harm to halt the crime. In the study, a research accomplice\nwould put a beach blanket down five feet from the blanket of a ran-\ndomly chosen individual—the experimental subject. After a couple of\nminutes on the blanket spent relaxing and listening to music from a\nportable radio, the accomplice would stand up and leave the blanket\nto stroll down the beach. A few minutes later, a second researcher,\npretending to be a thief, would approach, grab the radio, and try to\nhurry away with it. As you might guess, under normal conditions,\nsubjects were very reluctant to put themselves in harm’s way by chal-\nlenging the thief—only four people did so in the twenty times, that the\ntheft was staged. But when the same procedure was tried another twenty\ntimes, with a slight twist, the results were drastically different. In these\nincidents, before taking his stroll, the accomplice would simply ask the\nsubject to please “watch my things,” which each of them agreed to do.\nNow, propelled by the rule for consistency, nineteen of the twenty\nsubjects became virtual vigilantes, running after and stopping the thief,\ndemanding an explanation, and often restraining the thief physically\nor snatching the radio away.\nTo understand why consistency is so powerful a motive, it is import-\nant to recognize that in most circumstances consistency is valued and\nadaptive. Inconsistency is commonly thought to be an undesirable\npersonality trait. The person whose beliefs, words, and deeds don’t\nmatch may be seen as indecisive, confused, two-faced, or even mentally\nill. On the other side, a high degree of consistency is normally associated\nwith personal and intellectual strength. It is at the heart of logic, ration-\nality, stability, and honesty. A quote attributed to the great British\nchemist Michael Faraday suggests the extent to which being consistent\nis approved—sometimes more than being right. When asked after a\nlecture if he meant to imply that a hated academic rival was always\nwrong, Faraday glowered at the questioner and replied, “He’s not that\nconsistent.”\nCertainly, then, good personal consistency is highly valued in our\nculture. And well it should be. It provides us with a reasonable and\ngainful orientation to the world. Most of the time we will be better off\nif our approach to things is well laced with consistency. Without it our\nlives would be difficult, erratic, and disjointed.Robert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 45\nBut because it is so typically in our best interests to be consistent, we\neasily fall into the habit of being automatically so, even in situations\nwhere it is not the sensible way to be. When it occurs unthinkingly,\nconsistency can be disastrous. Nonetheless, even blind consistency has\nits attractions.\nFirst, like most other forms of automatic responding, it offers a\nshortcut through the density of modern life. Once we have made up\nour minds about an issue, stubborn consistency allows us a very appeal-\ning luxury: We really don’t have to think hard about the issue anymore.\nWe don’t have to sift through the blizzard of information we encounter\nevery day to identify relevant facts; we don’t have to expend the mental\nenergy to weigh the pros and cons; we don’t have to make any further\ntough decisions. Instead, all we have to do when confronted with the\nissue is to turn on our consistency tape, whirr, and we know just what\nto believe, say, or do. We need only believe, say, or do whatever is\nconsistent with our earlier decision.\nThe allure of such a luxury is not to be minimized. It allows us a\nconvenient, relatively effortless, and efficient method for dealing with\ncomplex daily environments that make severe demands on our mental\nenergies and capacities. It is not hard to understand, then, why automat-\nic consistency is a difficult reaction to curb. It offers us a way to evade\nthe rigors of continuing thought. And as Sir Joshua Reynolds noted,\n“There is no expedient to which a man will not resort to avoid the real\nlabor of thinking.” With our consistency tapes operating, then, we can\ngo about our business happily excused from the toil of having to think\ntoo much.\nThere is a second, more perverse attraction of mechanical consistency\nas well. Sometimes it is not the effort of hard, cognitive work that makes\nus shirk thoughtful activity, but the harsh consequences of that activity.\nSometimes it is the cursedly clear and unwelcome set of answers\nprovided by straight thinking that makes us mental slackers. There are\ncertain disturbing things we simply would rather not realize. Because\nit is a preprogrammed and mindless method of responding, automatic\nconsistency can supply a safe hiding place from those troubling realiz-\nations. Sealed within the fortress walls of rigid consistency, we can be\nimpervious to the sieges of reason.\nOne night at an introductory lecture given by the transcendental\nmeditation (TM) program, I witnessed a nice illustration of how people\nwill hide inside the walls of consistency to protect themselves from the\ntroublesome consequences of thought. The lecture itself was presided\nover by two earnest young men and was designed to recruit new46 / Influence\nmembers into the program. The program claimed it could teach a unique\nbrand of meditation that would allow us to achieve all manner of desir-\nable things, ranging from simple inner peace to the more spectacular\nabilities to fly and pass through walls at the program’s advanced (and\nmore expensive) stages.\nI had decided to attend the meeting to observe the kind of compliance\ntactics used in recruitment lectures of this sort and had brought along\nan interested friend, a university professor whose areas of specialization\nwere statistics and symbolic logic. As the meeting progressed and the\nlecturers explained the theory behind TM, I noticed my logician friend\nbecoming increasingly restless. Looking more and more pained and\nshifting about constantly in his seat, he was finally unable to resist.\nWhen the leaders called for questions at the completion of the lecture,\nhe raised his hand and gently but surely demolished the presentation\nwe had just heard. In less than two minutes, he pointed out precisely\nwhere and why the lecturers’ complex argument was contradictory, il-\nlogical, and unsupportable. The effect on the discussion leaders was\ndevastating. After a confused silence, each attempted a weak reply only\nto halt midway to confer with his partner and finally to admit that my\ncolleague’s points were good ones “requiring further study.”\nMore interesting to me, though, was the effect upon the rest of the\naudience. At the end of the question period, the two recruiters were\nfaced with a crush of audience members submitting their seventy-five-\ndollar down payments for admission to the TM program. Nudging,\nshrugging, and chuckling to one another as they took in the payments,\nthe recruiters betrayed signs of giddy bewilderment. After what ap-\npeared to have been an embarrassingly clear collapse of their presenta-\ntion, the meeting had somehow turned into a great success, generating\nmystifyingly high levels of compliance from the audience. Although\nmore than a bit puzzled, I chalked up the audience response to a failure\nto understand the logic of my colleague’s arguments. As it turned out,\nhowever, just the reverse was the case.\nOutside the lecture room after the meeting, we were approached by\nthree members of the audience, each of whom had given a down pay-\nment immediately after the lecture. They wanted to know why we had\ncome to the session. We explained, and we asked the same question of\nthem. One was an aspiring actor who wanted desperately to succeed\nat his craft and had come to the meeting to learn if TM would allow\nhim to achieve the necessary self-control to master the art; the recruiters\nhad assured him that it would. The second described herself as a severe\ninsomniac who had hopes that TM would provide her with a way to\nrelax and fall asleep easily at night. The third served as unofficial\nspokesman. He also had a sleep-related problem. He was failing collegeRobert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 47\nbecause there didn’t seem to be enough time to study. He had come to\nthe meeting to find out if TM could help by training him to need fewer\nhours of sleep each night; the additional time could then be used for\nstudy. It is interesting to note that the recruiters informed him as well\nas the insomniac that Transcendental Meditation techniques could solve\ntheir respective, though opposite, problems.\nStill thinking that the three must have signed up because they hadn’t\nunderstood the points made by my logician friend, I began to question\nthem about aspects of his argument. To my surprise, I found that they\nhad understood his comments quite well; in fact, all too well. It was\nprecisely the cogency of his argument that drove them to sign up for\nthe program on the spot. The spokesman put it best: “Well, I wasn’t\ngoing to put down any money tonight because I’m really quite broke\nright now; I was going to wait until the next meeting. But when your\nbuddy started talking, I knew I’d better give them my money now, or\nI’d go home and start thinking about what he said and never sign up.”\nAll at once, things began to make sense. These were people with real\nproblems; and they were somewhat desperately searching for a way to\nsolve those problems. They were seekers who, if our discussion leaders\nwere to be believed, had found a potential solution in TM. Driven by\ntheir needs, they very much wanted to believe that TM was their answer.\nNow, in the form of my colleague, intrudes the voice of reason,\nshowing the theory underlying their newfound solution to be unsound.\nPanic! Something must be done at once before logic takes its toll and\nleaves them without hope again. Quickly, quickly, walls against reason\nare needed; and it doesn’t matter that the fortress to be erected is a\nfoolish one. “Quick, a hiding place from thought! Here, take this money.\nWhew, safe in the nick of time. No need to think about the issues any\nlonger. The decision has been made, and from now on the consistency\ntape can be played whenever necessary: ‘TM? Certainly I think it will\nhelp me; certainly I expect to continue; certainly I believe in TM. I\nalready put my money down for it, didn’t I?’ Ah, the comforts of\nmindless consistency. I’ll just rest right here for a while. It’s so much\nnicer than the worry and strain of that hard, hard search.”\nIf, as it appears, automatic consistency functions as a shield against\nthought, it should not be surprising that such consistency can also be\nexploited by those who would prefer that we not think too much in\nresponse to their requests for our compliance. For the exploiters, whose\ninterest will be served by an unthinking, mechanical reaction to their\nrequests, our tendency for automatic consistency is a gold mine. So\nclever are they at arranging to have us play our consistency tapes when\nit profits them that we seldom realize we have been taken. In fine jujitsu48 / Influence\nfashion, they structure their interactions with us so that our own need\nto be consistent will lead directly to their benefit.\nCertain large toy manufacturers use just such an approach to reduce\na problem caused by seasonal buying patterns. Of course, the boom\ntime for toy sales occurs before and during the Christmas holiday sea-\nson. The toy companies make fat profits during this period. Their\nproblem is that toy sales then go into a terrible slump for the next couple\nof months. Their customers have already spent the full amount in their\ntoy budgets and are stiffly resistant to their children’s pleas for more.\nEven those children whose birthdays fall soon after the holidays receive\nfewer toys because of the recent Christmas spree.\nSo the toy manufacturers are faced with a dilemma: how to keep sales\nhigh during the peak season and, at the same time, retain a healthy\ndemand for toys in the immediately following months. Their difficulty\ncertainly doesn’t lie in convincing our naturally insatiable offspring to\nwant a continuous flow of new amusements. A series of flashy television\ncommercials placed among the Saturday morning cartoon shows will\nproduce the usual amounts of begging, whining, and wheedling no\nmatter when it appears during the year. No, the problem is not in mo-\ntivating kids to want more toys after Christmas.\nThe problem is in motivating postholiday spent-out parents to reach\ndown for the price of yet another plaything for their already toy-glutted\nchildren. What could the toy companies possibly do to produce that\nunlikely behavior? Some have tried a greatly increased advertising\ncampaign, others have reduced prices during the slack period, but\nneither of those standard sales devices has proved successful. Not only\nare both tactics costly, but both have also been ineffective in increasing\nsales to desired levels. Parents are simply not in a toy-buying mood,\nand the influences of advertising or reduced expense are not enough\nto shake that stony resistance.\nCertain large toy manufacturers, however, think they have found a\nsolution. It’s an ingenious one, involving no more than a normal advert-\nising expense and an understanding of the powerful pull of the need\nfor consistency. My first hint of how the toy companies’ strategy worked\ncame after I fell for it and then, in true patsy form, fell for it again.\nIt was January, and I was in the town’s largest toy store. After pur-\nchasing all too many gifts there for my son a month before, I had sworn\nnot to enter that place or any like it for a long, long time. Yet there I\nwas, not only in the diabolic place but also in the process of buying my\nson another expensive toy—a big, electric road-race set. In front of the\nroad-race display, I happened to meet a former neighbor who was\nbuying his son the same toy. The odd thing was that we almost never\nsaw each other anymore. In fact, the last time was a year earlier in thatRobert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 49\nsame store where we were both buying our sons an expensive post-\nChristmas gift—that time a robot that walked, talked, and laid waste.\nWe laughed about our strange pattern of seeing each other only once\na year at the same time, in the same place, while doing the same thing.\nLater that day, I mentioned the coincidence to a friend who, it turned\nout, had once worked in the toy business.\n“No coincidence,” he said knowingly.\n“What do you mean, ‘No coincidence’?”\n“Look,” he said, “let me ask you a couple of questions about the road-\nrace set you bought this year. First, did you promise your son that he’d\nget one for Christmas?”\n“Well, yes, I did. Christopher had seen a bunch of ads for them on\nthe Saturday morning cartoon shows and said that was what he wanted\nfor Christmas. I saw a couple of the ads myself and it looked like fun,\nso I said okay.”\n“Strike one,” he announced. “Now for my second question. When\nyou went to buy one, did you find all the stores sold out?”\n“That’s right, I did! The stores said they’d ordered some but didn’t\nknow when they’d get any more in. So I had to buy Christopher some\nother toys to make up for the road-race set. But how did you know?”\n“Strike two,” he said. “Just let me ask one more question. Didn’t this\nsame sort of thing happen the year before with the robot toy?”\n“Wait a minute…you’re right. That’s just what happened. This is in-\ncredible. How did you know?”\n“No psychic powers; I just happen to know how several of the big\ntoy companies jack up their January and February sales. They start\nprior to Christmas with attractive TV ads for certain special toys. The\nkids, naturally, want what they see and extract Christmas promises for\nthese items from their parents. Now here’s where the genius of the\ncompanies’ plan comes in: They undersupply the stores with the toys\nthey’ve gotten the parents to promise. Most parents find those things\nsold out and are forced to substitute other toys of equal value. The toy\nmanufacturers, of course, make a point of supplying the stores with\nplenty of these substitutes. Then, after Christmas, the companies start\nrunning the ads again for the other, special toys. That juices up the kids\nto want those toys more than ever. They go running to their parents\nwhining, ‘You promised, you promised,’ and the adults go trudging\noff to the store to live up dutifully to their words.”\n“Where,” I said, beginning to seethe now, “they meet other parents\nthey haven’t seen for a year, falling for the same trick, right?”\n“Right. Uh, where are you going?”\n“I’m going to take that road-race set right back to the store.” I was\nso angry I was nearly shouting.50 / Influence\n“Wait. Think for a minute first. Why did you buy it this morning?”\n“Because I didn’t want to let Christopher down and because I wanted\nto teach him that promises are to be lived up to.”\n“Well, has any of that changed? Look, if you take his toy away now,\nhe won’t understand why. He’ll just know that his father broke a\npromise to him. Is that what you want?”\n“No,” I said, sighing, “I guess not. So, you’re telling me that they\ndoubled their profit on me for the past two years, and I never even\nknew it; and now that I do, I’m still trapped—by my own words. So,\nwhat you’re really telling me is, ‘Strike three.’”\nHe nodded, “And you’re out.”\nCOMMITMENT IS THE KEY\nOnce we realize that the power of consistency is formidable in directing\nhuman action, an important practical question immediately arises: How\nis that force engaged? What produces the click that activates the whirr\nof the powerful consistency tape? Social psychologists think they know\nthe answer: commitment. If I can get you to make a commitment (that\nis, to take a stand, to go on record), I will have set the stage for your\nautomatic and ill-considered consistency with that earlier commitment.\nOnce a stand is taken, there is a natural tendency to behave in ways\nthat are stubbornly consistent with the stand.\nAs we’ve already seen, social psychologists are not the only ones who\nunderstand the connection between commitment and consistency.\nCommitment strategies are aimed at us by compliance professionals of\nnearly every sort. Each of the strategies is intended to get us to take\nsome action or make some statement that will trap us into later compli-\nance through consistency pressures. Procedures designed to create\ncommitment take various forms. Some are fairly straightforward; others\nare among the most subtle compliance tactics we will encounter.\nFor instance, suppose you wanted to increase the number of people\nin your area who would agree to go door-to-door collecting donations\nfor your favorite charity. You would be wise to study the approach\ntaken by social psychologist Steven J. Sherman. He simply called a\nsample of Bloomington, Indiana, residents as part of a survey he was\ntaking and asked them to predict what they would say if asked to spend\nthree hours collecting money for the American Cancer Society. Of\ncourse, not wanting to seem uncharitable to the survey taker or to\nthemselves, many of these people said that they would volunteer. The\nconsequence of this sly commitment procedure was a 700 percent in-\ncrease in volunteers when, a few days later, a representative of the\nAmerican Cancer Society did call and ask for neighborhood canvassers.Robert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 51\nUsing the same strategy, but this time asking Columbus, Ohio, residents\nto predict whether they would vote on Election Day, a team of research-\ners led by Anthony Greenwald were able to increase significantly the\nturnout in a U.S. presidential election among those called.\nPerhaps an even more crafty commitment technique has been de-\nveloped recently by telephone solicitors for charity. Have you noticed\nthat callers asking you to contribute to some cause or another these\ndays seem to begin things by inquiring about your current health and\nwell-being? “Hello Mr./Ms. Targetperson,” they say. “How are you\nfeeling this evening?” Or, “How are you doing today?” The caller’s in-\ntent with this sort of introduction is not merely to seem friendly and\ncaring. It is to get you to respond—as you normally do to such polite,\nsuperficial inquiries—with a polite, superficial comment of your own:\n“Just fine” or “Real good” or “I’m doing great, thanks.” Once you have\npublicly stated that all is well, it becomes much easier for the solicitor\nto corner you into aiding those for whom all is not well: “I’m glad to\nhear that, because I’m calling to ask if you’d be willing to make a\ndonation to help out the unfortunate victims of…”\nThe theory behind this tactic is that people who have just asserted\nthat they are doing/feeling fine—even as a routine part of a sociable\nexchange—will consequently find it awkward to appear stingy in the\ncontext of their own admittedly favored circumstances. If all this sounds\na bit farfetched, consider the findings of consumer researcher Daniel\nHoward, who put the theory to test. Dallas, Texas, residents were called\non the phone and asked if they would agree to allow a representative\nof the Hunger Relief Committee to come to their homes to sell them\ncookies, the proceeds from which would be used to supply meals for\nthe needy. When tried alone, that request (labeled the “standard solicit-\nation approach”) produced only 18 percent agreement. However, if the\ncaller initially asked, “How are you feeling this evening?” and waited\nfor a reply before proceeding to the standard approach, several note-\nworthy things happened. First, of the 120 individuals called, most (108)\ngave the customary favorable reply (“Good,” “Fine,” “Real well,” etc.).\nSecond, 32 percent of the people who got the “How are you feeling to-\nnight” question agreed to receive the cookie seller at their homes, nearly\ntwice the success rate of the standard solicitation approach. Third, true\nto the consistency principle, almost everyone who agreed to such a\nvisit did, in fact, make a cookie purchase when contacted at home (89\npercent).\nTo make sure that this tactic doesn’t generate its successes simply\nbecause a solicitor who uses it seems more concerned and courteous\nthan one who doesn’t use it, Howard conducted another study. This\ntime callers began either with the question “How are you feeling this52 / Influence\nevening?” (and waited for a response before proceeding) or with the\nstatement “I hope you are feeling well this evening” and then proceeded\nto the standard solicitation approach. Despite the fact that the caller\nstarted each type of interaction with a warm and friendly comment,\nthe “How are you feeling” technique was, by far, superior to its rival\n(33 percent vs. 15 percent compliance), because it alone drew an exploit-\nable public commitment from its targets. Note that the commitment\nwas able to get twice as much compliance from those targets even\nthough at the time it occurred it must have seemed to them an altogether\ninconsequential reply to an altogether superficial question—yet another\nfine example of social jujitsu at work.\nThe question of what makes a commitment effective has a number\nof answers. A variety of factors affect the ability of a commitment to\nconstrain our future behavior. One large-scale program designed to\nproduce compliance illustrates nicely how several of the factors work.\nThe remarkable thing about this program is that it was systematically\nemploying these factors decades ago, well before scientific research had\nidentified them.\nDuring the Korean War, many captured American soldiers found\nthemselves in prisoner-of-war (POW) camps run by the Chinese Com-\nmunists. It became clear early in the conflict that the Chinese treated\ncaptives quite differently than did their allies, the North Koreans, who\nfavored savagery and harsh punishment to gain compliance. Specifically\navoiding the appearance of brutality, the Red Chinese engaged in what\nthey termed their “lenient policy,” which was in reality a concerted and\nsophisticated psychological assault on their captives. After the war,\nAmerican psychologists questioned the returning prisoners intensively\nto determine what had occurred. The intensive psychological investig-\nation took place, in part, because of the unsettling success of some as-\npects of the Chinese program. For example, the Chinese were very ef-\nfective in getting Americans to inform on one another, in striking con-\ntrast to the behavior of American POWs in World War II. For this\nreason, among others, escape plans were quickly uncovered and the\nescape attempts themselves almost always unsuccessful. “When an es-\ncape did occur,” wrote Dr. Edgar Schein, a principal American invest-\nigator of the Chinese indoctrination program in Korea, “the Chinese\nusually recovered the man easily by offering a bag of rice to anyone\nturning him in.” In fact, nearly all American prisoners in the Chinese\ncamps are said to have collaborated with the enemy in one form or an-\nother.2\nAn examination of the Chinese prison-camp program shows that its\npersonnel relied heavily on commitment and consistency pressures toRobert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 53\ngain the desired compliance from prisoners. Of course, the first problem\nfacing the Chinese was how to get any collaboration at all from the\nAmericans. These were men who were trained to provide nothing but\nname, rank, and serial number. Short of physical brutalization, how\ncould the captors hope to get such men to give military information,\nturn in fellow prisoners, or publicly denounce their country? The\nChinese answer was elementary: Start small and build.\nFor instance, prisoners were frequently asked to make statements so\nmildly anti-American or pro-Communist as to seem inconsequential\n(“The United States is not perfect.” “In a Communist country, unem-\nployment is not a problem.”). But once these minor requests were\ncomplied with, the men found themselves pushed to submit to related\nyet more substantive requests. A man who had just agreed with his\nChinese interrogator that the United States is not perfect might then be\nasked to indicate some of the ways in which he thought this was the\ncase. Once he had so explained himself, he might be asked to make a\nlist of these “problems with America” and to sign his name to it. Later\nhe might be asked to read his list in a discussion group with other\nprisoners. “After all, it’s what you really believe, isn’t it?” Still later he\nmight be asked to write an essay expanding on his list and discussing\nthese problems in greater detail.\nThe Chinese might then use his name and his essay in an anti-\nAmerican radio broadcast beamed not only to the entire camp, but to\nother POW camps in North Korea, as well as to American forces in\nSouth Korea. Suddenly he would find himself a “collaborator,” having\ngiven aid to the enemy. Aware that he had written the essay without\nany strong threats or coercion, many times a man would change his\nimage of himself to be consistent with the deed and with the new “col-\nlaborator” label, often resulting in even more extensive acts of collabor-\nation. Thus, while “only a few men were able to avoid collaboration\naltogether,” according to Dr. Schein, “the majority collaborated at one\ntime or another by doing things which seemed to them trivial but which\nthe Chinese were able to turn to their own advantage…. This was par-\nticularly effective in eliciting confessions, self-criticism, and information\nduring interrogation.”3\nIf the Chinese know about the subtle power of this approach, it should\nnot be surprising that another group of people interested in compliance\nis also aware of its usefulness. Many business organizations employ it\nregularly.\nFor the salesperson, the strategy is to obtain a large purchase by\nstarting with a small one. Almost any small sale will do, because the\npurpose of that small transaction is not profit. It is commitment. Further54 / Influence\npurchases, even much larger ones, are expected to flow naturally from\nthe commitment. An article in the trade magazine American Salesman\nput it succinctly:\nThe general idea is to pave the way for full-line distribution by\nstarting with a small order…. Look at it this way—when a person\nhas signed an order for your merchandise, even though the profit\nis so small it hardly compensates for the time and effort of making\nthe call, he is no longer a prospect—he is a customer.4\nThe tactic of starting with a little request in order to gain eventual\ncompliance with related larger requests has a name: the foot-in-the-\ndoor technique. Social scientists first became aware of its effectiveness\nin the mid-1960s when psychologists Jonathan Freedman and Scott\nFraser published an astonishing set of data.5 They reported the results\nof an experiment in which a researcher, posing as a volunteer worker,\nhad gone door to door in a residential California neighborhood making\na preposterous request of homeowners. The homeowners were asked\nto allow a public-service billboard to be installed on their front lawns.\nTo get an idea of just how the sign would look, they were shown a\nphotograph depicting an attractive house, the view of which was almost\ncompletely obscured by a very large, poorly lettered sign reading DRIVE\nCAREFULLY. Although the request was normally and understandably\nrefused by the great majority (83 percent) of the other residents in the\narea, this particular group of people reacted quite favorably. A full 76\npercent of them offered the use of their front yards.\nThe prime reason for their startling compliance has to do with\nsomething that had happened to them about two weeks earlier: They\nhad made a small commitment to driver safety. A different volunteer\nworker had come to their doors and asked them to accept and display\na little three-inch-square sign that read BE A SAFE DRIVER. It was such a\ntrifling request that nearly all of them had agreed to it. But the effects\nof that request were enormous. Because they had innocently complied\nwith a trivial safe-driving request a couple of weeks before, these\nhomeowners became remarkably willing to comply with another such\nrequest that was massive in size.\nFreedman and Fraser didn’t stop there. They tried a slightly different\nprocedure on another sample of homeowners. These people first re-\nceived a request to sign a petition that favored “keeping California\nbeautiful.” Of course, nearly everyone signed, since state beauty, like\nefficiency in government or sound prenatal care, is one of those issues\nalmost no one is against. After waiting about two weeks, Freedman\nand Fraser sent a new “volunteer worker” to these same homes to ask\nthe residents to allow the big DRIVE CAREFULLY sign to be erected onRobert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 55\ntheir lawns. In some ways, their response was the most astounding of\nany of the homeowners in the study. Approximately half of these people\nconsented to the installation of the DRIVE CAREFULLY billboard, even\nthough the small commitment they had made weeks earlier was not to\ndriver safety but to an entirely different public-service topic, state\nbeautification.\nAt first, even Freedman and Fraser were bewildered by their findings.\nWhy should the little act of signing a petition supporting state beauti-\nfication cause people to be so willing to perform a different and much\nlarger favor? After considering and discarding other explanations,\nFreedman and Fraser came upon one that offered a solution to the\npuzzle: Signing the beautification petition changed the view these people\nhad of themselves. They saw themselves as public-spirited citizens who\nacted on their civic principles. When, two weeks later, they were asked\nto perform another public service by displaying the DRIVE CAREFULLY\nsign, they complied in order to be consistent with their newly formed\nself-images. According to Freedman and Fraser,\nWhat may occur is a change in the person’s feelings about getting\ninvolved or taking action. Once he has agreed to a request, his at-\ntitude may change, he may become, in his own eyes, the kind of\nperson who does this sort of thing, who agrees to requests made\nby strangers, who takes action on things he believes in, who co-\noperates with good causes.6\nWhat the Freedman and Fraser findings tell us, then, is to be very\ncareful about agreeing to trivial requests. Such an agreement can not\nonly increase our compliance with very similar, much larger re-quests,\nit can also make us more willing to perform a variety of larger favors\nthat are only remotely connected to the little one we did earlier. It’s this\nsecond, general kind of influence concealed within small commitments\nthat scares me.\nIt scares me enough that I am rarely willing to sign a petition any-\nmore, even for a position I support. Such an action has the potential to\ninfluence not only my future behavior but also my self-image in ways\nI may not want. And once a person’s self-image is altered, all sorts of\nsubtle advantages become available to someone who wants to exploit\nthat new image.\nWho among Freedman and Fraser’s homeowners would have thought\nthat the “volunteer worker” who asked them to sign a state beautifica-\ntion petition was really interested in having them display a safe-driving\nbillboard two weeks later? And who among them could have suspected\nthat their decision to display the billboard was largely due to the act of\nsigning the petition? No one, I’d guess. If there were any regrets after56 / Influence\nthe billboard went up, who could they conceivably hold responsible\nbut themselves and their own damnably strong civic spirit? They probably\nnever even considered the guy with the “keeping California beautiful”\npetition and all that knowledge of jujitsu.\nNotice that all of the foot-in-the-door experts seem to be excited about\nthe same thing: You can use small commitments to manipulate a per-\nson’s self-image; you can use them to turn citizens into “public ser-\nvants,” prospects into “customers,” prisoners into “collaborators.” And\nonce you’ve got a man’s self-image where you want it, he should comply\nnaturally with a whole range of your requests that are consistent with\nthis view of himself.\nNot all commitments affect self-image, however. There are certain\nconditions that should be present for a commitment to be effective in\nthis way. To discover what they are, we can once again look to the\nAmerican experience in the Chinese prison camps of Korea. It is import-\nant to understand that the major intent of the Chinese was not simply\nto extract information from their prisoners. It was to indoctrinate them,\nto change their attitudes and percep-tions of themselves, of their polit-\nical system, of their country’s role in the war, and of communism. And\nthere is evidence that the program often worked alarmingly well.\nDr. Henry Segal, chief of the neuropsychiatric evaluation team that\nexamined returning POWs at the war’s end, reported that war-related\nbeliefs had been substantially shifted. The majority of the men believed\nthe Chinese story that the United States had used germ warfare, and\nmany felt that their own forces had been the initial aggressors in starting\nthe war. Similar inroads had been made in the political attitudes of the\nmen:\nMany expressed antipathy toward the Chinese Communists but\nat the same time praised them for “the fine job they have done in\nChina.” Others stated that “although communism won’t work in\nAmerica, I think it’s a good thing for Asia.”7\nIt appears that the real goal of the Chinese was to modify, at least for\na time, the hearts and minds of their captives. If we measure their\nachievement in terms of “defection, disloyalty, changed attitudes and\nbeliefs, poor discipline, poor morale, poor esprit, and doubts as to\nAmerica’s role,” Dr. Segal concluded that “their efforts were highly\nsuccessful.” Because commitment tactics were so much a part of the\neffective Chinese assault on hearts and minds, it is quite informative\nto examine the specific features of the tactics they used.Robert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 57\nThe Magic Act\nOur best evidence of what people truly feel and believe comes less from\ntheir words than from their deeds. Observers trying to decide what a\nman is like look closely at his actions. What the Chinese have discovered\nis that the man himself uses this same evidence to decide what he is\nlike. His behavior tells him about himself; it is a primary source of in-\nformation about his beliefs and values and attitudes. Understanding\nfully this important principle of self-perception, the Chinese set about\narranging the prison-camp experience so that their captives would\nconsistently act in desired ways. Before long, the Chinese knew, these\nactions would begin to take their toll, causing the men to change their\nviews of themselves to align with what they had done.\nWriting was one sort of confirming action that the Chinese urged\nincessantly upon the men. It was never enough for the prisoners to\nlisten quietly or even to agree verbally with the Chinese line; they were\nalways pushed to write it down as well. So intent were the Chinese on\nsecuring a written statement that if a prisoner was not willing to write\na desired response freely, he was prevailed upon to copy it. The\nAmerican psychologist Edgar Schein describes a standard indoctrination\nsession tactic of the Chinese in these terms:\nA further technique was to have the man write out the question\nand then the [pro-Communist] answer. If he refused to write it\nvoluntarily, he was asked to copy it from the notebooks, which\nmust have seemed like a harmless enough concession.\nBut, oh, those “harmless” concessions. We’ve already seen how ap-\nparently trifling commitments can lead to extraordinary further beha-\nvior. And the Chinese knew that, as a commitment device, a written\ndeclaration has some great advantages. First, it provides physical\nevidence that the act occurred. Once a man wrote what the Chinese\nwanted, it was very difficult for him to believe that he had not done so.\nThe opportunities to forget or to deny to himself what he had done\nwere not available, as they are for purely verbal statements. No; there\nit was in his own handwriting, an irrevocably documented act driving\nhim to make his beliefs and his self-image consistent with what he had\nundeniably done.\nA second advantage of a written testament is that it can be shown to\nother people. Of course, that means it can be used to persuade those\npeople. It can persuade them to change their own attitudes in the direc-\ntion of the statement. But more important for the purpose of commit-\nment, it can persuade them that the author genuinely believes what58 / Influence\nwas written. People have a natural tendency to think that a statement\nreflects the true attitude of the person who made it. What is surprising\nis that they continue to think so even when they know that the person\ndid not freely choose to make the statement.\nSome scientific evidence that this is the case comes from a study by\npsychologists Edward Jones and James Harris, who showed people an\nessay that was favorable to Fidel Castro and asked them to guess the\ntrue feelings of its author.8 Jones and Harris told some of these people\nthat the author had chosen to write a pro-Castro essay; and they told\nthe other people that the author had been required to write in favor of\nCastro. The strange thing was that even those people who knew that\nthe author had been assigned to do a pro-Castro essay guessed that he\nliked Castro. It seems that a statement of belief produces a click, whirr\nresponse in those who view it. Unless there is strong evidence to the\ncontrary, observers automatically assume that someone who makes\nsuch a statement means it.\nThink of the double-barreled effects on the self-image of a prisoner\nwho wrote a pro-Chinese or anti-American statement. Not only was it\na lasting personal reminder of his action, it was also likely to persuade\nthose around him that the statement reflected his actual beliefs. And,\nas we will see in Chapter 4, what those around us think is true of us is\nenormously important in determining what we ourselves think is true.\nFor example, one study found that after hearing that they were con-\nsidered charitable people, New Haven, Connecticut, housewives gave\nmuch more money to a canvasser from the Multiple Sclerosis Associ-\nation.9 Apparently the mere knowledge that someone viewed them as\ncharitable caused these women to make their actions consistent with\nanother’s perception of them.\nOnce an active commitment is made, then, self-image is squeezed\nfrom both sides by consistency pressures. From the inside, there is a\npressure to bring self-image into line with action. From the outside,\nthere is a sneakier pressure—a tendency to adjust this image according\nto the way others perceive us. And because others see us as believing\nwhat we have written (even when we’ve had little choice in the matter),\nwe will once again experience a pull to bring self-image into line with\nthe written statement.\nIn Korea, several subtle devices were used to get the prisoners to\nwrite, without direct coercion, what the Chinese wanted. For example,\nthe Chinese knew that many prisoners were eager to let their families\nknow that they were alive. At the same time, the men knew that their\ncaptors were censoring the mails and that only some letters were being\nallowed out of camp. To ensure that their own letters would be released,\nsome prisoners began including in their messages peace appeals, claimsRobert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 59\nof kind treatment, and statements sympathetic to communism. The\nhope was that the Chinese would want such letters to surface and\nwould, therefore, allow their delivery. Of course, the Chinese were\nhappy to cooperate because those letters served their interests mar-\nvelously. First, their worldwide propaganda effort benefited greatly\nfrom the appearance of pro-Communist statements by American ser-\nvicemen. Second, in the service of prisoner indoctrination, they had,\nwithout raising a finger of physical force, gotten many men to go on\nrecord as supporting the Chinese cause.\nA similar technique involved political essay contests that were regu-\nlarly held in camp. The prizes for winning were invariably small—a\nfew cigarettes or a bit of fruit—but were sufficiently scarce that they\ngenerated a lot of interest from the men. Usually the winning essay was\none that took a solidly pro-Communist stand…but not always. The\nChinese were wise enough to realize that most of the prisoners would\nnot enter a contest that they could win only by writing a Communist\ntract. And the Chinese were clever enough to know how to plant small\ncommitments to communism in the men that could be nurtured into\nlater bloom. So the prize was occasionally given to an essay that gener-\nally supported the United States but that bowed once or twice to the\nChinese view. The effects of this strategy were exactly what the Chinese\nwanted. The men continued to participate voluntarily in the contests\nbecause they saw that they could win with an essay highly favorable\nto their own country. But perhaps without realizing it, they began to\nshade their essays a bit toward communism in order to have a better\nchance of winning. The Chinese were ready to pounce on any concession\nto Communist dogma and to bring consistency pressures to bear upon\nit. In the case of a written declaration within a voluntary essay, they\nhad a perfect commitment from which to build toward collaboration\nand conversion.\nOther compliance professionals also know about the committing\npower of written statements. The enormously successful Amway Cor-\nporation, for instance, has hit upon a way to spur their sales personnel\nto greater and greater accomplishments. Members of the staff are asked\nto set individual sales goals and commit themselves to those goals by\npersonally recording them on paper:\nOne final tip before you get started: Set a goal and write it down.\nWhatever the goal, the important thing is that you set it, so you’ve\ngot something for which to aim—and that you write it down. There\nis something magical about writing things down. So set a goal and60 / Influence\nwrite it down. When you reach that goal, set another and write\nthat down. You’ll be off and running.10\nIf the Amway people have found “something magical about writing\nthings down,” so have other business organizations. Some door-to-door\nsales companies use the magic of written commitments to battle the\n“cooling-off” laws recently passed in many states. The laws are designed\nto allow customers a few days after purchasing an item to cancel the\nsale and receive a full refund. At first this legislation hurt the hard-sell\ncompanies deeply. Because they emphasize high-pressure tactics, their\ncustomers often buy, not because they want the product but because\nthey are duped or intimidated into the sale. When the new laws went\ninto effect, these customers began canceling in droves.\nThe companies have since learned a beautifully simple trick that cuts\nthe number of such cancellations drastically. They merely have the\ncustomer, rather than the salesman, fill out the sales agreement. Accord-\ning to the sales-training program of a prominent encyclopedia company,\nthat personal commitment alone has proved to be “a very important\npsychological aid in preventing customers from backing out of their\ncontracts.” Like the Amway Corporation, then, these organizations\nhave found that something special happens when people personally\nput their commitments on paper: They live up to what they have written\ndown.\nAnother common way for businesses to cash in on the “magic” of\nwritten declarations occurs through the use of an innocent-looking\npromotional device. Before I began to study weapons of social influence,\nI used to wonder why big companies such as Procter & Gamble and\nGeneral Foods are always running those “25-, 50-, or 100 words or less”\ntestimonial contests. They all seem to be alike. The contestant is to\ncompose a short personal statement that begins with the words, “Why\nI like…” and goes on to laud the features of whatever cake mix or floor\nwax happens to be at issue. The company judges the entries and awards\nsome stunningly large prizes to the winners. What had puzzled me was\nwhat the companies got out of the deal. Often the contest requires no\npurchase; anyone submitting an entry is eligible. Yet, the companies\nappear to be strangely willing to incur the huge costs of contest after\ncontest.\nI am no longer puzzled. The purpose behind the testimonial contests\nis the same as the purpose behind the political essay contests of the\nChinese Communists. In both instances, the aim is to get as many people\nas possible to go on record as liking the product. In Korea, the product\nwas a brand of Chinese communism; in the United States, it might be\na brand of cuticle remover. The type of product doesn’t matter; theRobert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 61\nprocess is the same. Participants voluntarily write essays for attractive\nprizes that they have only a small chance to win. But they know that\nfor an essay to have any chance of winning at all, it must include praise\nfor the product. So they find praiseworthy features of the product and\ndescribe them in their essays. The result is hundreds of men in Korea\nor hundreds of thousands of people in America who testify in writing\nto the product’s appeal and who, consequently, experience that “magic-\nal” pull to believe what they have written.\nThe Public Eye\nOne reason that written testaments are effective in bringing about\ngenuine personal change is that they can so easily be made public. The\nprisoner experience in Korea showed the Chinese to be quite aware of\nan important psychological principle: Public commitments tend to be\nlasting commitments. The Chinese constantly arranged to have the pro-\nCommunist statements of their captives seen by others. A man who\nhad written a political essay the Chinese liked, for example, might find\ncopies of it posted around camp, or might be asked to read it to a pris-\noner discussion group, or even to read it on the camp radio broadcast.\nAs far as the Chinese were concerned, the more public the better. Why?\nWhenever one takes a stand that is visible to others, there arises a\ndrive to maintain that stand in order to look like a consistent person.\nRemember that earlier in this chapter we described how desirable good\npersonal consistency is as a trait; how someone without it could be\njudged as fickle, uncertain, pliant, scatterbrained, or unstable; how\nsomeone with it is viewed as rational, assured, trustworthy, and sound.\nGiven this context, it is hardly surprising that people try to avoid the\nlook of inconsistency. For appearances’ sake, then, the more public a\nstand, the more reluctant we will be to change it.\nAn illustration of how public commitments can lead to doggedly\nconsistent further action is provided in a famous experiment performed\nby a pair of prominent social psychologists, Morton Deutsch and Harold\nGerard. The basic procedure was to have college students first estimate\nin their own minds the length of lines they were shown. At this point,\none sample of the students had to commit themselves publicly to their\ninitial judgments by writing them down, signing their names to them,\nand turning them in to the experimenter. A second sample of students\nalso committed themselves to their first estimates, but they did so\nprivately by putting them on a Magic Writing Pad and then erasing\nthem by lifting the Magic Pad’s plastic cover before anyone could see\nwhat they had written. A third set of students did not commit them-62 / Influence\nselves to their initial estimates at all; they just kept the estimates in mind\nprivately.\nIn these ways, Deutsch and Gerard had cleverly arranged for some\nstudents to commit themselves publicly, some privately, and some not\nat all to their initial decisions. What Deutsch and Gerard wanted to find\nout was which of the three types of students would be most inclined\nto stick with their first judgments after receiving information that those\njudgments were incorrect. So all of the students were given new evid-\nence suggesting that their initial estimates were wrong, and they were\nthen given the chance to change their estimates.\nThe results were quite clear. The students who had never written\ndown their first choices were the least loyal to those choices. When new\nevidence was presented that questioned the wisdom of decisions that\nhad never left their heads, these students were the most influenced by\nthe new information to change what they had viewed as the “correct”\ndecision. Compared to these uncommitted students, those who had\nmerely written their decisions for a moment on a Magic Pad were sig-\nnificantly less willing to change their minds when given the chance.\nEven though they had committed themselves under the most anonym-\nous of circumstances, the act of writing down their first judgments\ncaused them to resist the influence of contradictory new data and to\nremain consistent with the preliminary choices. But Deutsch and Gerard\nfound that, by far, it was the students who had publicly recorded their\ninitial positions who most resolutely refused to shift from those positions\nlater. Public commitment had hardened them into the most stubborn\nof all.\nThis sort of stubbornness can occur even in situations where accuracy\nshould be more important than consistency. In one study, when six- or\ntwelve-person experimental juries were deciding a close case, hung\njuries were significantly more frequent if the jurors had to express their\nopinions with a visible show of hands rather than by secret ballot. Once\njurors had stated their initial views publicly, they were reluctant to allow\nthemselves to change publicly, either. Should you ever find yourself as\nthe foreperson of a jury under these conditions, then, you could reduce\nthe risk of a hung jury by choosing a secret rather than public balloting\ntechnique.11\nThe Deutsch and Gerard finding that we are truest to our decisions\nif we have bound ourselves to them publicly can be put to good use.\nConsider the organizations dedicated to helping people rid themselves\nof bad habits. Many weight-reduction clinics, for instance, understand\nthat often a person’s private decision to lose weight will be too weak\nto withstand the blandishments of bakery windows, wafting cooking\nscents, and late-night Sara Lee commercials. So they see to it that theRobert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 63\ndecision is buttressed by the pillars of public commitment. They require\ntheir clients to write down an immediate weight-loss goal and show that\ngoal to as many friends, relatives, and neighbors as possible. Clinic\noperators report that frequently this simple technique works where all\nelse has failed.\nOf course, there’s no need to pay a special clinic in order to engage\na visible commitment as an ally. One San Diego woman described to\nme how she employed a public promise to help herself finally stop\nsmoking:\nI remember it was after I heard about another scientific study\nshowing that smoking causes cancer. Every time one of those\nthings came out, I used to get determined to quit, but I never could.\nThis time, though, I decided I had to do something. I’m a proud\nperson. It matters to me if other people see me in a bad light. So I\nthought, “Maybe I can use that pride to help me dump this damn\nhabit.” So I made a list of all the people who I really wanted to\nrespect me. Then I went out and got some blank business cards\nand I wrote on the back of each card, “I promise you that I will\nnever smoke another cigarette.”\nWithin a week, I had given or sent a signed card to everybody on the\nlist—my dad, my brother back East, my boss, my best girlfriend, my\nex-husband, everybody but one—the guy I was dating then. I was just\ncrazy about him, and I really wanted him to value me as a person. Be-\nlieve me, I thought twice about giving him a card because I knew that\nif I couldn’t keep my promise to him I’d die. But one day at the of-\nfice—he worked in the same building as I did—I just walked up to him,\nhanded him the card, and walked away without saying anything.\nQuitting “cold turkey” was the hardest thing I’ve ever done. There\nmust have been a thousand times when I thought I had to have a smoke.\nBut whenever that happened, I’d just picture how all of the people on\nmy list, especially this one guy, would think less of me if I couldn’t stick\nto my guns. And that’s all it took. I’ve never taken another puff.\nYou know, the interesting thing is the guy turned out to be a real\nschmuck. I can’t figure out what I saw in him back then. But at the time,\nwithout knowing it, he helped me get through the toughest part of the\ntoughest thing I’ve ever had to do. I don’t even like him anymore. Still,\nI do feel grateful in a way because I think he saved my life.\nThe Effort Extra\nYet another reason that written commitments are so effective is that\nthey require more work than verbal ones. And the evidence is clear that64 / Influence\nthe more effort that goes into a commitment, the greater is its ability to\ninfluence the attitudes of the person who made it. We can find that\nevidence quite close to home or as far away as the back regions of the\nprimitive world. For example, there is a tribe in southern Africa, the\nThonga, that requires each of its boys to go through an elaborate initi-\nation ceremony before he can be counted a man of the tribe. As with\nmany other primitive peoples, a Thonga boy endures a great deal before\nhe is admitted to adult membership in the group. Anthropologists\nWhiting, Kluckhohn, and Anthony have described this three-month\nordeal in brief but vivid terms:\nWhen a boy is somewhere between 10 and 16 years of age, he is\nsent by his parents to “circumcision school,” which is held every\n4 or 5 years. Here in company with his age-mates he undergoes\nsevere hazing by the adult males of the society. The initiation be-\ngins when each boy runs the gauntlet between two rows of men\nwho beat him with clubs. At the end of this experience he is\nstripped of his clothes and his hair is cut. He is next met by a man\ncovered with lion manes and is seated upon a stone facing this\n“lion man.” Someone then strikes him from behind and when he\nturns his head to see who has struck him, his foreskin is seized\nand in two movements cut off by the “lion man.” Afterward he is\nsecluded for three months in the “yard of mysteries,” where he\ncan be seen only by the initiated.\nDuring the course of his initiation, the boy undergoes six major\ntrials: beatings, exposure to cold, thirst, eating of unsavory foods,\npunishment, and the threat of death. On the slightest pretext, he\nmay be beaten by one of the newly initiated men, who is assigned\nto the task by the older men of the tribe. He sleeps without cover-\ning and suffers bitterly from the winter cold. He is forbidden to\ndrink a drop of water during the whole three months. Meals are\noften made nauseating by the half-digested grass from the stomach\nof an antelope, which is poured over his food. If he is caught\nbreaking any important rule governing the ceremony, he is severe-\nly punished. For example, in one of these punishments, sticks are\nplaced between the fingers of the offender, then a strong man\ncloses his hand around that of the novice, practically crushing his\nfingers. He is frightened into submission by being told that in\nformer times boys who had tried to escape or who had revealed\nthe secrets to women or to the uninitiated were hanged and their\nbodies burned to ashes.12\nOn the face of it, these rites seem extraordinary and bizarre. Yet, at\nthe same time, they can be seen to be remarkably similar in principleRobert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 65\nand even in detail to the common initiation ceremonies of school fra-\nternities. During the traditional “Hell Week” held yearly on college\ncampuses, fraternity pledges must persevere through a variety of\nactivities designed by the older members to test the limits of physical\nexertion, psychological strain, and social embarrassment. At week’s\nend, the boys who have persisted through the ordeal are accepted for\nfull group membership. Mostly their tribulations have left them no\nmore than greatly tired and a bit shaky, although sometimes the negative\neffects are more serious.\nWhat is interesting is how closely the particular features of Hell Week\ntasks match those of the tribal initiation rites. Recall that anthropologists\nidentified six major trials to be endured by a Thonga initiate during his\nstay in the “yard of mysteries.” A scan of newspaper reports shows\nthat each trial also has its place in the hazing rituals of Greek-letter so-\ncieties:\n•Beatings. Fourteen-year-old Michael Kalogris spent three weeks in a\nLong Island hospital recovering from internal injuries suffered during\na Hell Night initiation ceremony of his high-school fraternity, Omega\nGamma Delta. He had been administered the “atomic bomb” by his\nprospective brothers, who told him to hold his hands over his head\nand keep them there while they gathered around to slam fists into\nhis stomach and back simultaneously and repeatedly.\n•Exposure to cold. On a winter night, Frederick Bronner, a California\njunior-college student, was taken three thousand feet up and ten\nmiles into the hills of a national forest by his prospective fraternity\nbrothers. Left to find his way home wearing only a thin sweatshirt\nand slacks, Fat Freddy, as he was called, shivered in a frigid wind\nuntil he tumbled down a steep ravine, fracturing bones and hurting\nhis head. Prevented by his injuries from going on, he huddled there\nagainst the cold until he died of exposure.\n•Thirst. Two Ohio State University freshmen found themselves in the\n“dungeon” of their prospective fraternity house after breaking the\nrule requiring all pledges to crawl into the dining area prior to Hell\nWeek meals. Once locked in the house storage closet, they were given\nonly salty foods to eat for nearly two days. Nothing was provided\nfor drinking purposes except a pair of plastic cups in which they\ncould catch their own urine.\n•Eating of unsavory foods. At Kappa Sigma house on the campus of the\nUniversity of Southern California, the eyes of eleven pledges bulged\nwhen they saw the sickening task before them. Eleven quarter-pound\nslabs of raw liver lay on a tray. Cut thick and soaked in oil, each was\nto be swallowed whole, one to a boy. Gagging and choking re-66 / Influence\npeatedly, young Richard Swanson failed three times to down his\npiece. Determined to succeed, he finally got the oil-soaked meat into\nhis throat where it lodged and, despite all efforts to remove it, killed\nhim.\n•Punishment. In Wisconsin, a pledge who forgot one section of a ritual\nincantation to be memorized by all initiates was punished for his er-\nror. He was required to keep his feet under the rear legs of a folding\nchair while the heaviest of his fraternity brothers sat down and drank\na beer. Although the pledge did not cry out during the punishment,\na bone in each of his feet was broken.\n•Threats of death. A pledge of Zeta Beta Tau fraternity was taken to a\nbeach area of New Jersey and told to dig his “own grave.” Seconds\nafter he complied with orders to lie flat in the finished hole, the sides\ncollapsed, suffocating him before his prospective fraternity brothers\ncould dig him out.\nThere is another striking similarity between the initiation rites of tribal\nand fraternal societies: They simply will not die. Resisting all attempts\nto eliminate or suppress them, such hazing practices have been phenom-\nenally resilient. Authorities, in the form of colonial governments or\nuniversity administrations, have tried threats, social pressures, legal\nactions, banishments, bribes, and bans to persuade the groups to remove\nthe hazards and humiliations from their initiation ceremonies. None\nhas been successful. Oh, there may be a change while the authority is\nwatching closely. But this is usually more apparent than real, the\nharsher trials occurring under more secret circumstances until the\npressure is off and they can surface again.\nOn some college campuses, officials have tried to eliminate dangerous\nhazing practices by substituting a “Help Week” of civic service or by\ntaking direct control of the initiation rituals. When such attempts are\nnot slyly circumvented by fraternities, they are met with outright\nphysical resistance. For example, in the aftermath of Richard Swanson’s\nchoking death at USC, the university president issued new rules requir-\ning that all pledging activities be reviewed by school authorities before\ngoing into effect and that adult advisers be present during initiation\nceremonies. According to one national magazine, “The new ‘code’ set\noff a riot so violent that city police and fire detachments were afraid to\nenter campus.”\nResigning themselves to the inevitable, other college representatives\nhave given up on the possibility of abolishing the degradations of Hell\nWeek. “If hazing is a universal human activity, and every bit of evidence\npoints to this conclusion, you most likely won’t be able to ban it effect-\nively. Refuse to allow it openly and it will go underground. You can’tRobert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 67\nban sex, you can’t prohibit alcohol, and you probably can’t eliminate\nhazing!”13\nWhat is it about hazing practices that make them so precious to these\nsocieties? What could make the groups want to evade, undermine, or\ncontest any effort to ban the degrading and perilous features of their\ninitiation rites? Some have argued that the groups themselves are\ncomposed of psychological or social miscreants whose twisted needs\ndemand that others be harmed and humiliated. But the evidence does\nnot support such a view. Studies done on the personality traits of fra-\nternity members, for instance, show them to be, if anything, slightly\nhealthier than other college students in their psychological adjustment.\nSimilarly, fraternities are known for their willingness to engage in be-\nneficial community projects for the general social good. What they are\nnot willing to do, however, is substitute these projects for their initiation\nceremonies. One survey at the University of Washington found that,\nof the fraternity chapters examined, most had a type of Help Week\ntradition but that this community service was in addition to Hell Week.\nIn only one case was such service directly related to initiation proced-\nures.14\nThe picture that emerges of the perpetrators of hazing practices is of\nnormal individuals who tend to be psychologically stable and socially\nconcerned but who become aberrantly harsh as a group at only one\ntime—immediately before the admission of new members to the society.\nThe evidence, then, points to the ceremony as the culprit. There must\nbe something about its rigors that is vital to the group. There must be\nsome function to its harshness that the group will fight relentlessly to\nmaintain. What?\nMy own view is that the answer appeared in 1959 in the results of a\nstudy little known outside of social psychology. A pair of young re-\nsearchers, Elliot Aronson and Judson Mills, decided to test their obser-\nvation that “persons who go through a great deal of trouble or pain to\nattain something tend to value it more highly than persons who attain\nthe same thing with a minimum of effort.” The real stroke of inspiration\ncame in their choice of the initiation ceremony as the best place to ex-\namine this possibility. They found that college women who had to en-\ndure a severely embarrassing initiation ceremony in order to gain access\nto a sex discussion group convinced themselves that their new group\nand its discussions were extremely valuable, even though Aronson and\nMills had previously rehearsed the other group members to be as\n“worthless and uninteresting” as possible. Different coeds, who went\nthrough a much milder initiation ceremony or went through no initiation\nat all, were decidedly less positive about the “worthless” new group\nthey had joined. Additional research showed the same results when68 / Influence\ncoeds were required to endure pain rather than embarrassment to get\ninto a group. The more electric shock a woman received as part of the\ninitiation ceremony, the more she later persuaded herself that her new\ngroup and its activities were interesting, intelligent, and desirable.15\nNow the harassments, the exertions, even the beatings of initiation\nrituals begin to make sense. The Thonga tribesman watching, with tears\nin his eyes, his ten-year-old son tremble through a night on the cold\nground of the “yard of mysteries,” the college sophomore punctuating\nhis Hell Night paddling of his fraternity “little brother” with bursts of\nnervous laughter—these are not acts of sadism. They are acts of group\nsurvival. They function, oddly enough, to spur future society members\nto find the group more attractive and worthwhile. As long as it is the\ncase that people like and believe in what they have struggled to get,\nthese groups will continue to arrange effortful and troublesome initiation\nrites. The loyalty and dedication of those who emerge will increase to\na great degree the chances of group cohesiveness and survival. Indeed,\none study of fifty-four tribal cultures found that those with the most\ndramatic and stringent initiation ceremonies were those with the greatest\ngroup solidarity.16 Given Aronson and Mills’s demonstration that the\nseverity of an initiation ceremony significantly heightens the newcomer’s\ncommitment to the group, it is hardly surprising that groups will oppose\nall attempts to eliminate this crucial link to their future strength.\nMilitary groups and organizations are by no means exempt from\nthese same processes. The agonies of “boot camp” initiations to the\narmed services are legendary. The novelist William Styron, a former\nMarine, catalogs his own experiences in language we could easily apply\nto the Thongas (or, for that matter, to the Kappas or Betas or Alphas):\n“the remorseless close-order drill hour after hour in the burning sun,\nthe mental and physical abuse, the humiliations, the frequent sadism\nat the hands of drill sergeants, all the claustrophobic and terrifying in-\nsults to the spirit which can make an outpost like Quantico or Parris\nIsland one of the closest things in the free world to a concentration\ncamp.” But, in his commentary, Styron does more than recount the\nmisery of this “training nightmare”—he recognizes its intended out-\ncome: “There is no ex-Marine of my acquaintance, regardless of what\ndirection he may have taken spiritually or politically after those callow\ngung-ho days, who does not view the training as a crucible out of which\nhe emerged in some way more resilient, simply braver and better for\nthe wear.”\nBut why should we believe William Styron, the writer, in such mat-\nters? After all, for professional storytellers, the line between truth and\nfiction is often blurred. Indeed, why should we believe him when he\nalleges that the “infernal” character of his military training was not onlyRobert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 69\nsuccessful, it was specifically intended, intended to create desired levels\nof pride and camaraderie among those who endured and survived it?\nAt least one reason to accept his assessment comes from unfictionalized\nreality—the case of West Point cadet John Edwards, who was expelled\nfrom the U.S. Military Academy in 1988 on charges involving the au-\nthorized hazing that all first-year cadets experience at the hands of\nupperclassmen to ensure that the newcomers can withstand the rigors\nof West Point training. It was not that Mr. Edwards, who ranked aca-\ndemically near the top of his eleven-hundred-member class, had been\nunable to bear up under the ritual when he was subjected to it. Nor was\nhe expelled because he had been aberrantly cruel in his treatment of\nthe younger cadets. His offense was that he would not expose the\nnewcomers to what he felt was “absurd and dehumanizing” treatment.\nOnce again, then, it appears that, for groups concerned about creating\na lasting sense of solidarity and distinction, the hardship of demanding\ninitiation activities provides a valuable advantage that they will not\neasily surrender—either to aspiring members who are unwilling to take\nthe harshness or to give it out.\nThe Inner Choice\nExamination of such diverse activities as the indoctrination practices\nof the Chinese Communists and the initiation rituals of college fratern-\nities has provided some valuable information about commitment. It\nappears that commitments are most effective in changing a person’s\nself-image and future behavior when they are active, public, and effort-\nful. But there is another property of effective commitment that is more\nimportant than the other three combined. To understand what it is, we\nfirst need to solve a pair of puzzles in the actions of Communist inter-\nrogators and fraternity brothers.\nThe first puzzle comes from the refusal of fraternity chapters to allow\npublic-service activities to be part of their initiation ceremonies. Recall\nthat one survey showed that community projects, though frequent,\nwere nearly always separated from the membership-induction program.\nBut why? If an effortful commitment is what fraternities are after in\ntheir initiation rites, surely they could structure enough distasteful and\nstrenuous civic activities for their pledges; there is plenty of exertion\nand unpleasantness to be had in the world of old-age-home repairs,\nmental-health-center yard work, and hospital bedpan duty. Besides,\ncommunity-spirited endeavors of this sort would do much to improve\nthe highly unfavorable public and media image of fraternity Hell Week\nrites; a survey showed that for every positive newspaper story concern-\ning Hell Week, there were five negative stories. If only for public-rela-70 / Influence\ntions reasons, then, fraternities should want to incorporate community-\nservice efforts into their initiation practices. But they don’t.\nTo examine the second puzzle, we need to return to the Chinese\nprison camps of Korea and the regular political essay contests held for\nAmerican captives. The Chinese wanted as many Americans as possible\nto enter these contests so that, in the process, they might write things\nfavorable to the Communist view. If, however, the idea was to attract\nlarge numbers of entrants, why were the prizes so small? A few extra\ncigarettes or a little fresh fruit were often all that a contest winner could\nexpect. In the setting, even these prizes were valuable, but still there\nwere much larger rewards—warm clothing, special mail privileges,\nincreased freedom of movement in camp—that the Chinese could have\nused to increase the number of essay writers. Yet they specifically chose\nto employ the smaller rather than the larger, more motivating rewards.\nAlthough the settings are quite different, the surveyed fraternities\nrefused to allow civic activities into their initiation ceremonies for the\nsame reason that the Chinese withheld large prizes in favor of less\npowerful inducements: They wanted the men to own what they had\ndone. No excuses, no ways out were allowed. A man who suffered\nthrough an arduous hazing could not be given the chance to believe he\ndid so for charitable purposes. A prisoner who salted his political essay\nwith a few anti-American comments could not be permitted to shrug\nit off as motivated by a big reward. No, the fraternity chapters and\nChinese Communists were playing for keeps. It was not enough to\nwring commitments out of their men; those men had to be made to take\ninner responsibility for their actions.\nGiven the Chinese Communist government’s affinity for the political-\nessay contest as a commitment device, it should come as no surprise\nthat a wave of such contests appeared in the aftermath of the 1989\nmassacre in Tiananmen Square, where pro-democracy protesters were\ngunned down by government soldiers. In Beijing alone, nine state-run\nnewspapers and television stations sponsored essay competitions on\nthe “quelling of the counterrevolutionary rebellion.” Still acting in accord\nwith its long-standing and insightful de-emphasis of rewards for public\ncommitments, the Beijing government left the contest prizes unspecified.\nSocial scientists have determined that we accept inner responsibility\nfor a behavior when we think we have chosen to perform it in the ab-\nsence of strong outside pressures. A large reward is one such external\npressure. It may get us to perform a certain action, but it won’t get us\nto accept inner responsibility for the act. Consequently, we won’t feel\ncommitted to it. The same is true of a strong threat; it may motivate\nimmediate compliance, but it is unlikely to produce long-term commit-\nment.Robert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 71\nAll this has important implications for rearing children. It suggests\nthat we should never heavily bribe or threaten our children to do the\nthings we want them truly to believe in. Such pressures will probably\nproduce temporary compliance with our wishes. However, if we want\nmore than just that, if we want the children to believe in the correctness\nof what they have done, if we want them to continue to perform the\ndesired behavior when we are not present to apply those outside pres-\nsures, then we must somehow arrange for them to accept inner respons-\nibility for the actions we want them to take. An experiment by Jonathan\nFreedman gives us some hints about what to do and what not to do in\nthis regard.\nFreedman wanted to see if he could prevent second- to fourth-grade\nboys from playing with a fascinating toy, just because he had said that\nit was wrong to do so some six weeks earlier. Anyone familiar with\nseven-to-nine-year-old boys must realize the enormity of the task. But\nFreedman had a plan. If he could first get the boys to convince them-\nselves that it was wrong to play with the forbidden toy, perhaps that\nbelief would keep them from playing with it thereafter. The difficult\nthing was making the boys believe that it was wrong to amuse them-\nselves with the toy—an extremely expensive, battery-controlled robot.\nFreedman knew it would be easy enough to have a boy obey tempo-\nrarily. All he had to do was threaten the boy with severe consequences\nshould he be caught playing with the toy. As long as he was nearby to\ndeal out stiff punishment, Freedman figured that few boys would risk\noperating the robot. He was right. After showing a boy an array of five\ntoys and warning him, “It is wrong to play with the robot. If you play\nwith the robot, I’ll be very angry and will have to do something about\nit,” Freedman left the room for a few minutes. During that time, the\nboy was observed secretly through a one-way mirror. Freedman tried\nthis threat procedure on twenty-two different boys, and twenty-one of\nthem never touched the robot while he was gone.\nSo a strong threat was successful while the boys thought they might\nbe caught and punished. But Freedman had already guessed that. He\nwas really interested in the effectiveness of the threat in guiding the\nboys’ behavior later on, when he was no longer around. To find out\nwhat would happen then, he sent a young woman back to the boys’\nschool about six weeks after he had been there. She took the boys out\nof the class one at a time to participate in an experiment. Without ever\nmentioning any connection with Freedman, she escorted each boy back\nto the room with the five toys and gave him a drawing test. While she\nwas scoring the test, she told the boy that he was free to play with any\ntoy in the room. Of course, almost all the boys played with a toy. The\ninteresting result was that, of the boys playing with a toy, 77 percent72 / Influence\nchose to play with the robot that had been forbidden to them earlier.\nFreedman’s severe threat, which had been so successful six weeks before,\nwas almost totally unsuccessful when he was no longer able to back it\nup with punishment.\nBut Freedman wasn’t finished yet. He changed his procedure slightly\nwith a second sample of boys. These boys, too, were initially shown the\narray of five toys by Freedman and warned not to play with the robot\nwhile he was briefly out of the room because “It is wrong to play with\nthe robot.” But this time, Freedman provided no strong threat to\nfrighten a boy into obedience. He simply left the room and observed\nthrough the one-way mirror to see if his instruction against playing\nwith the forbidden toy was enough. It was. Just as with the other sample,\nonly one of the twenty-two boys touched the robot during the short\ntime Freedman was gone.\nThe real difference between the two samples of boys came six weeks\nlater, when they had a chance to play with the toys while Freedman\nwas no longer around. An astonishing thing happened with the boys\nwho had earlier been given no strong threat against playing with the\nrobot: When given the freedom to play with any toy they wished, most\navoided the robot, even though it was by far the most attractive of the\nfive toys available (the others were a cheap plastic submarine, a child’s\nbaseball glove without a ball, an unloaded toy rifle, and a toy tractor).\nWhen these boys played with one of the five toys, only 33 percent chose\nthe robot.\nSomething dramatic had happened to both groups of boys. For the\nfirst group, it was the severe threat they heard from Freedman to back\nup his statement that playing with the robot was “wrong.” It had been\nquite effective at first when Freedman could catch them should they\nviolate his rule. Later, though, when he was no longer present to observe\nthe boys’ behavior, his threat was impotent and his rule was, con-\nsequently, ignored. It seems clear that the threat had not taught the\nboys that operating the robot was wrong, only that it was unwise to do\nso when the possibility of punishment existed.\nFor the other boys, the dramatic event had come from the inside, not\nthe outside. Freedman had instructed them, too, that playing with the\nrobot was wrong, but he had added no threat of punishment should\nthey disobey him. There were two important results. First, Freedman’s\ninstruction alone was enough to prevent the boys from operating the\nrobot while he was briefly out of the room. Second, the boys took per-\nsonal responsibility for their choice to stay away from the robot during\nthat time. They decided that they hadn’t played with it because they\ndidn’t want to. After all, there were no strong punishments associated\nwith the toy to explain their behavior otherwise. Thus, weeks later,Robert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 73\nwhen Freedman was nowhere around, they still ignored the robot be-\ncause they had been changed inside to believe that they did not want\nto play with it.17\nAdults facing the child-rearing experience can take a cue from the\nFreedman study. Suppose a couple wants to impress upon their\ndaughter that lying is wrong. A strong, clear threat (“It’s bad to lie,\nhoney; so if I catch you at it, I’ll cut your tongue out”) might well be\neffective when the parents are present or when the girl thinks she can\nbe discovered. But it will not achieve the larger goal of convincing her\nthat she does not want to lie because she thinks it’s wrong. To do that,\na much subtler approach is required. A reason must be given that is\njust strong enough to get her to be truthful most of the time but is not\nso strong that she sees it as the obvious reason for her truthfulness. It’s\na tricky business, because exactly what this barely sufficient reason will\nbe changes from child to child. For one little girl, a simple appeal may\nbe enough (“It’s bad to lie, honey; so I hope you won’t do it”); for an-\nother child, it may be necessary to add a somewhat stronger reason\n(“…because if you do, I’ll be disappointed in you”); for a third child, a\nmild form of warning may be required as well (“…and I’ll probably\nhave to do something I don’t want to do”). Wise parents will know\nwhich kind of reason will work on their own children. The important\nthing is to use a reason that will initially produce the desired behavior\nand will, at the same time, allow a child to take personal responsibility\nfor that behavior. Thus, the less detectable outside pressure such a\nreason contains, the better. Selecting just the right reason is not an easy\ntask for parents. But the effort should pay off. It is likely to mean the\ndifference between short-lived compliance and long-term commitment.\nFor a pair of reasons we have already talked about, compliance pro-\nfessionals love commitments that produce inner change. First, that\nchange is not just specific to the situation where it first occurred; it\ncovers a whole range of related situations, too. Second, the effects of\nthe change are lasting. So, once a man has been induced to take action\nthat shifts his self-image to that of, let’s say, a public-spirited citizen,\nhe is likely to be public-spirited in a variety of other circumstances\nwhere his compliance may also be desired, and he is likely to continue\nhis public-spirited behavior for as long as his new self-image holds.\nThere is yet another attraction in commitments that lead to inner\nchange—they grow their own legs. There is no need for the compliance\nprofessional to undertake a costly and continuing effort to reinforce the\nchange; the pressure for consistency will take care of all that. After our\nfriend comes to view himself as a public-spirited citizen, he will auto-\nmatically begin to see things differently. He will convince himself that74 / Influence\nit is the correct way to be. He will begin to pay attention to facts he\nhadn’t noticed before about the value of community service. He will\nmake himself available to hear arguments he hadn’t heard before favor-\ning civic action. And he will find such arguments more persuasive than\nbefore. In general, because of the need to be consistent within his system\nof beliefs, he will assure himself that his choice to take public-spirited\naction was right. What is important about this process of generating\nadditional reasons to justify the commitment is that the reasons are new.\nThus, even if the original reason for the civic-minded behavior was\ntaken away, these newly discovered reasons might be enough by\nthemselves to support his perception that he had behaved correctly.\nThe advantage to an unscrupulous compliance professional is tre-\nmendous. Because we build new struts to undergird choices we have\ncommitted ourselves to, an exploitative individual can offer us an in-\nducement for making such a choice, and after the decision has been\nmade, can remove that inducement, knowing that our decision will\nprobably stand on its own newly created legs. New-car dealers fre-\nquently try to benefit from this process through a trick they call\n“throwing a lowball.” I first encountered the tactic while posing as a\nsales trainee at a local Chevrolet dealership. After a week of basic in-\nstruction, I was allowed to watch the regular salesmen perform. One\npractice that caught my attention right away was the lowball.\nFor certain customers, a very good price is offered on a car, perhaps\nas much as four hundred dollars below competitors’ prices. The good\ndeal, however, is not genuine; the dealer never intends it to go through.\nIts only purpose is to cause a prospect to decide to buy one of the deal-\nership’s cars. Once the decision is made, a number of activities develop\nthe customer’s sense of personal commitment to the car—a raft of pur-\nchase forms are filled out, extensive financing terms are arranged,\nsometimes the customer is encouraged to drive the car for a day before\nsigning the contract “so you can get the feel of it and show it around\nin the neighborhood and at work.” During this time, the dealer knows,\ncustomers automatically develop a range of new reasons to support the\nchoice they have now made.\nThen something happens. Occasionally an “error” in the calculations\nis discovered—maybe the salesman forgot to add in the cost of the air\nconditioner, and if the buyer still requires air conditioning, four hundred\ndollars must be added to the price. To keep from being suspected of\ngouging by the customer, some dealers let the bank handling the finan-\ncing find the mistake. At other times, the deal is disallowed at the last\nmoment when the salesman checks with his boss, who cancels it because\n“We’d be losing money.” For only another four hundred dollars the\ncar can be had, which, in the context of a multithousand-dollar deal,Robert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 75\ndoesn’t seem too steep since, as the salesman emphasizes, the cost is\nequal to competitors’ and “This is the car you chose, right?” Another,\neven more insidious form of lowballing occurs when the salesman\nmakes an inflated trade-in offer on the prospect’s old car as part of the\nbuy/trade package. The customer recognizes the offer as overly gener-\nous and jumps at the deal. Later, before the contract is signed, the used-\ncar manager says that the salesman’s estimate was four hundred dollars\ntoo high and reduces the trade-in allowance to its actual, blue-book\nlevel. The customer, realizing that the reduced offer is the fair one, ac-\ncepts it as appropriate and sometimes feels guilty about trying to take\nadvantage of the salesman’s high estimate. I once witnessed a woman\nprovide an embarrassed apology to a salesman who had used the last\nversion of lowballing on her—this while she was signing a new-car\ncontract giving him a huge commission. He looked hurt but managed\na forgiving smile.\nNo matter which variety of lowballing is used, the sequence is the\nsame: An advantage is offered that induces a favorable purchase de-\ncision; then, sometime after the decision has been made but before the\nbargain is sealed, the original purchase advantage is deftly removed.\nIt seems almost incredible that a customer would buy a car under these\ncircumstances. Yet it works—not on everybody, of course, but it is ef-\nfective enough to be a staple compliance procedure in many, many car\nshowrooms. Automobile dealers have come to understand the ability\nof a personal commitment to build its own support system, a support\nsystem of new justifications for the commitment. Often these justifica-\ntions provide so many strong legs for the decision to stand on that when\nthe dealer pulls away only one leg, the original one, there is no collapse.\nThe loss can be shrugged off by the customer who is consoled, even\nmade happy, by the array of other good reasons favoring the choice. It\nnever occurs to the buyer that those additional reasons might never\nhave existed had the choice not been made in the first place.18\nThe impressive thing about the lowball tactic is its ability to make a\nperson feel pleased with a poor choice. Those who have only poor\nchoices to offer us, then, are especially fond of the technique. We can\nfind them throwing lowballs in business, social, and personal situations.\nFor instance, there’s my neighbor Tim, a true lowball aficionado. Recall\nthat he’s the one who, by promising to change his ways, got his girl-\nfriend, Sara, to cancel her impending marriage to another and to take\nhim back. Since her decision for Tim, Sara has become more devoted\nto him than ever, even though he has not fulfilled his promises. She\nexplains this by saying that she has allowed herself to see all sorts of\npositive qualities in Tim she had never recognized before.76 / Influence\nI know full well that Sara is a lowball victim. Just as sure as I had\nwatched buyers fall for the give-it-and-take-it-away-later strategy in\nthe car showroom, I watched her fall for the same trick with Tim. For\nhis part, Tim remains the guy he has always been. But because the new\nattractions Sara has discovered (or created) in him are quite real for her,\nshe now seems satisfied with the same arrangement that was unaccept-\nable before her enormous commitment. The decision to choose Tim,\npoor as it may have been objectively, has grown its own supports and\nappears to have made Sara genuinely happy. I have never mentioned\nto Sara what I know about lowballing. The reason for my silence is not\nthat I think her better off in the dark on the issue. As a general guiding\nprinciple, more information is always better than less information. It’s\njust that, if I said a word, I am confident she would hate me for it.\nDepending on the motives of the person wishing to use them, any of\nthe compliance techniques discussed in this book can be employed for\ngood or for ill. It should not be surprising, then, that the lowball tactic\ncan be used for more socially beneficial purposes than selling new cars\nor reestablishing relationships with former lovers. One research project\ndone in Iowa, for example, shows how the lowball procedure can influ-\nence homeowners to conserve energy.19 The project, headed by Dr.\nMichael Pallak, began at the start of the Iowa winter when residents\nwho heated their homes with natural gas were contacted by an inter-\nviewer. The interviewer gave them some energy-conservation tips and\nasked them to try to save fuel in the future. Although they all agreed\nto try, when the researchers examined the utility records of these fam-\nilies after a month and again at winter’s end, it was clear that no real\nsavings had occurred. The residents who had promised to make a\nconservation attempt used just as much natural gas as a random sample\nof their neighbors who had not been contacted by an interviewer. Just\ngood intentions coupled with information about saving fuel, then, were\nnot enough to change habits.\nEven before the project began, Pallak and his research team had re-\ncognized that something more would be needed to shift long-standing\nenergy patterns. So they tried a slightly different procedure on a com-\nparable sample of Iowa natural-gas users. These people, too, were\ncontacted by an interviewer, who provided energy-saving hints and\nasked them to conserve. But for these families, the interviewer offered\nsomething else: Those residents agreeing to save energy would have\ntheir names publicized in newspaper articles as public-spirited, fuel-\nconserving citizens. The effect was immediate. One month later, when\nthe utility companies checked their meters, the homeowners in this\nsample had saved an average of 422 cubic feet of natural gas apiece.Robert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 77\nThe chance to have their names in the paper had motivated these resid-\nents to substantial conservation efforts for a period of a month.\nThen the rug was pulled out. The researchers extracted the reason\nthat had initially caused these people to save fuel. Each family that had\nbeen promised publicity received a letter saying it would not be possible\nto publicize their names after all.\nAt the end of the winter, the research team examined the effect that\nletter had had on the natural-gas usage of the families. Did they return\nto their old, wasteful habits when the chance to be in the newspaper\nwas removed? Hardly. For each of the remaining winter months, they\nactually conserved more fuel than they had during the time they thought\nthey would be publicly celebrated for it! In terms of percentage of energy\nsavings, they had managed a 12.2 percent first-month gas savings be-\ncause they expected to see themselves lauded in the paper. But after\nthe letter arrived informing them to the contrary, they did not return\nto their previous energy-use levels; instead, they increased their savings\nto a 15.5 percent level for the rest of the winter.\nAlthough we can never be completely sure of such things, one explan-\nation for their persistent behavior presents itself immediately. These\npeople had been lowballed into a conservation commitment through a\npromise of newspaper publicity. Once made, that commitment started\ngenerating its own support: The homeowners began acquiring new\nenergy habits, began feeling good about their public-spirited efforts,\nbegan convincing themselves of the vital need to reduce American de-\npendence on foreign fuel, began appreciating the monetary savings in\ntheir utility bills, began feeling proud of their capacity for self-denial,\nand, most important, began viewing themselves as conservation-\nminded. With all these new reasons present to justify the commitment\nto use less energy, it is no wonder that the commitment remained firm\neven after the original reason, newspaper publicity, had been kicked\naway.\nBut strangely enough, when the publicity factor was no longer a\npossibility, these families did not merely maintain their fuel-saving ef-\nfort, they heightened it. Any of a number of interpretations could be\noffered for that still stronger effort, but I have a favorite. In a way, the\nopportunity to receive newspaper publicity had prevented the\nhomeowners from fully owning their commitment to conservation. Of\nall the reasons supporting the decision to try to save fuel, it was the\nonly one that had come from the outside; it was the only one preventing\nthe homeowners from thinking that they were conserving gas because\nthey believed in it. So when the letter arrived canceling the publicity\nagreement, it removed the only impediment to these residents’ images\nof themselves as fully concerned, energy-conscious citizens. This un-78 / Influence\nqualified, new self-image then pushed them to even greater heights of\nconservation. Whether or not such an explanation is correct, a repeat\nstudy done by Pallak indicates that this hidden benefit of the lowball\ntactic is no fluke.\nThe experiment was done in summer on Iowans whose homes were\ncooled by central air-conditioning. Those homeowners who were\npromised newspaper publicity decreased their electricity use by 27.8\npercent during July, as compared to similar homeowners who were not\npromised any coverage or who were not contacted at all. At the end of\nJuly, a letter was sent canceling the publicity promise. Rather than re-\nverting to their old habits, the lowballed residents increased their August\nenergy savings to a stunning 41.6 percent. Much like Sara, they appeared\nto have become committed to a choice through an initial inducement\nand were still more dedicated to it after the inducement had been re-\nmoved.\nHOW TO SAY NO\n“Consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds.” Or, at least, so goes a\nfrequently heard quotation attributed to Ralph Waldo Emerson. But\nwhat a very odd thing to say. Looking around, it is obvious that, quite\ncontrary to what Emerson seems to have suggested, internal consistency\nis a hallmark of logic and intellectual strength, while its lack character-\nizes the intellectually scattered and limited among us. What, then, could\na thinker of Emerson’s caliber have meant when he assigned the trait\nof consistency to the small-minded? I was sufficiently intrigued to go\nback to the original source of his statement, the essay “Self-Reliance,”\nwhere it was clear that the problem lay not in Emerson, but in the\npopular version of what he had said. Actually he wrote, “A foolish\nconsistency is the hobgoblin of little minds.” For some obscure reason,\na central distinction had been lost as the years eroded the accurate\nversion of his statement to mean something entirely different and, upon\nclose inspection, entirely silly.20\nThat distinction should not be lost on us, however, because it is vital\nto the only effective defense I know against the weapons of influence\nembodied in the combined principles of commitment and consistency.\nAlthough consistency is generally good, even vital, there is a foolish,\nrigid variety to be shunned. It is this tendency to be automatically and\nunthinkingly consistent that Emerson referred to. And it is this tendency\nthat we must be wary of, for it lays us open to the maneuvers of those\nquence for profit.\nBut since automatic consistency is so useful in allowing us an econom-Robert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 79\nwho want to exploit the mechanical commitment     consistency se-\nical and appropriate way of behaving most of the time, we can’t decide\nmerely to eliminate it from our lives altogether. The results would be\ndisastrous. If, rather than whirring along in accordance with our prior\ndecisions and deeds, we stopped to think through the merits of every\nnew action before performing it, we would never have time to accom-\nplish anything significant. We need even that dangerous, mechanical\nbrand of consistency. The only way out of the dilemma is to know when\nsuch consistency is likely to lead to a poor choice. There are certain\nsignals—two separate kinds of signals, in fact—to tip us off. We register\neach type in a different part of our bodies.\nThe first sort of signal is easy to recognize. It occurs right in the pit\nof our stomachs when we realize we are trapped into complying with\na request we know we don’t want to perform. It has happened to me a\nhundred times. An especially memorable instance, though, took place\non a summer evening well before I began to study compliance tactics.\nI answered my doorbell to find a stunning young woman dressed in\nshorts and a revealing halter top. I noticed, nonetheless, that she was\ncarrying a clipboard and was asking me to participate in a survey.\nWanting to make a favorable impression, I agreed and, I do admit,\nstretched the truth in my interview answers so as to present myself in\nthe most positive light. Our conversation went as follows:\nSTUNNING YOUNG WOMAN: Hello, I’m doing a survey on the entertain-\nment habits of city residents, and I wonder if you could answer a few\nquestions for me.\nCIALDINI: Do come in.\nSYW: Thank you. I’ll just sit right here and begin. How many times per\nweek would you say that you go out to dinner?\nC: Oh, probably three, maybe four times a week. Whenever I can, really;\nI love fine restaurants.\nSYW: How nice. And do you usually order wine with your dinner?\nC: Only if it’s imported.\nSYW: I see. What about movies? Do you go to the movies much?\nC: The cinema? I can’t get enough of good films. I especially like the80 / Influence\nsophisticated kind with the words on the bottom of the screen. How\nabout you? Do you like to see films?\nSYW: Uh…yes, I do. But let’s get back to the interview. Do you go to\nmany concerts?\nC: Definitely. The symphonic stuff mostly, of course; but I do enjoy a\nquality pop group as well.\nSYW (writing rapidly): Great! Just one more question. What about touring\nperformances by theatrical or ballet companies? Do you see them when\nthey’re in town?\nC: Ah, the ballet—the movement, the grace, the form—I love it. Mark\nme down as loving the ballet. See it every chance I get.\nSYW: Fine. Just let me recheck my figures here for a moment, Mr.\nCialdini.\nC: Actually, it’s Dr. Cialdini. But that sounds so formal; why don’t you\ncall me Bob?\nSYW: All right, Bob. From the information you’ve already given me, I’m\npleased to say that you could save up to twelve hundred dollars a year\nby joining Clubamerica! A small membership fee entitles you to dis-\ncounts on most of the activities you’ve mentioned. Surely someone as\nsocially vigorous as yourself would want to take advantage of the tre-\nmendous savings our company can offer on all the things you’ve already\ntold me you do.\nC (trapped like a rat): Well…uh…I…uh…I guess so.\nI remember quite well feeling my stomach tighten as I stammered\nmy agreement. It was a clear call to my brain, “Hey, you’re being taken\nhere!” But I couldn’t see a way out. I had been cornered by my own\nwords. To decline her offer at that point would have meant facing a\npair of distasteful alternatives: If I tried to back out by protesting that\nI was not actually the man-about-town I had claimed to be during the\ninterview, I would come off a liar; but trying to refuse without that\nprotest would make me come off a fool for not wanting to save twelve\nhundred dollars. So I bought the entertainment package, even thoughRobert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 81\nI knew I had been set up so that the need to be consistent with what I\nhad already said would snare me.\nNo more, though. I listen to my stomach these days. And I have dis-\ncovered a way to handle people who try to use the consistency principle\non me. I just tell them exactly what they are doing. It works beautifully.\nMost of the time, they don’t understand me; they just become sufficiently\nconfused to want to leave me alone. I think they suspect lunacy in\nanyone who responds to their requests by explaining what Ralph Waldo\nEmerson meant in distinguishing between consistency and foolish\nconsistency. Usually they have already begun edging away by the time\nI have mentioned “hobgoblins of the mind” and are gone long before\nI have described the click, whirr character of commitment and consist-\nency. Occasionally, though, they realize that I am on to their game. I\nalways know when that happens—it’s as clear as the egg on their faces.\nThey invariably become flustered, bumble through a hasty exit line,\nand go for the door.\nThis tactic has become the perfect counterattack for me. Whenever\nmy stomach tells me I would be a sucker to comply with a request\nmerely because doing so would be consistent with some prior commit-\nment I was tricked into, I relay that message to the requester. I don’t\ntry to deny the importance of consistency; I just point out the absurdity\nof foolish consistency. Whether, in response, the requester shrinks away\nguiltily or retreats in bewilderment, I am content. I have won; an ex-\nploiter has lost.\nI sometimes think about how it would be if that stunning young\nwoman of years ago were to try to sell me an entertainment-club\nmembership now. I have it all worked out. The entire interaction would\nbe the same, except for the end:\nSYW:…Surely someone as socially vigorous as yourself would want to\ntake advantage of the tremendous savings our company can offer on\nall the things you’ve already told me you do.\nC (with great self-assurance): Quite wrong. You see, I recognize what has\ngone on here. I know that your story about doing a survey was just a\npretext for getting people to tell you how often they go out and that,\nunder those circumstances, there is a natural tendency to exaggerate. I\nalso realize that your bosses selected you for this job because of your\nphysical attractiveness and told you to wear clothes showing a lot of\nyour resilient body tissue because a pretty, scantily clad woman is likely\nto get men to brag about what swingers they are in order to impress\nher. So I’m not interested in your entertainment club because of what\nEmerson said about foolish consistency and hobgoblins of the mind.82 / Influence\nSYW (staring blankly): Huh?\nC: Look. What I told you during your fake survey doesn’t matter. I refuse\nto allow myself to be locked into a mechanical sequence of commitment\nand consistency when I know it’s wrongheaded. No click, whirr for me.\nSYW: Huh?\nC: Okay, let me put it this way: (1) It would be stupid of me to spend\nmoney on something I don’t want. (2) I have it on excellent author-ity,\ndirect from my stomach, that I don’t want your entertainment plan. (3)\nTherefore, if you still believe that I will buy it, you probably also still\nbelieve in the Tooth Fairy. Surely, someone as intelligent as yourself\nwould be able to understand that.\nSYW (trapped like a stunning young rat): Well…uh…I…uh…I guess so.\nStomachs are not especially perceptive or subtle organs. Only when\nit is obvious that we are about to be conned are they likely to register\nand transmit that message. At other times, when it is not clear that we\nare being taken, our stomachs may never catch on. Under those circum-\nstances we have to look elsewhere for a clue. The situation of my\nneighbor Sara provides a good illustration. She made an important\ncommitment to Tim by canceling her prior marriage plans. That com-\nmitment has grown its own supports, so that even though the original\nreasons for the commitment are gone, she remains in harmony with it.\nShe has convinced herself with newly formed reasons that she did the\nright thing, so she stays with Tim. It is not difficult to see why there\nwould be no tightening in Sara’s stomach as a result. Stomachs tell us\nwhen we are doing something we think is wrong for us. Sara thinks no\nsuch thing. To her mind, she has chosen correctly and is behaving\nconsistently with that choice.\nYet, unless I badly miss my guess, there is a part of Sara that recog-\nnizes her choice as a mistake and her current living arrangement as a\nbrand of foolish consistency. Where, exactly, that part of Sara is located\nwe can’t be sure. But our language does give it a name: heart of hearts.\nIt is, by definition, the one place where we cannot fool ourselves. It is\nthe place where none of our justifications, none of our rationalizations\npenetrate. Sara has the truth there, although, right now, she can’t hear\nits signal clearly through the noise and static of the new support appar-\natus she has erected.\nIf Sara has erred in her choice of Tim, how long could she go withoutRobert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 83\nclearly recognizing it, without having a massive heart of hearts attack?\nThere is no telling. One thing is certain, however: As time passes, the\nvarious alternatives to Tim are disappearing. She had better determine\nsoon whether she is making a mistake.\nEasier said than done, of course. She must answer an extremely in-\ntricate question: “Knowing what I now know, if I could go back in time,\nwould I make the same choice?” The problem lies in the “Knowing\nwhat I now know” part of the question. Just what does she now know,\naccurately, about Tim? How much of what she thinks of him is the\nresult of a desperate attempt to justify the commitment she made? She\nclaims that since her decision to take him back, he cares for her more,\nis trying hard to stop his excessive drinking, has learned to make a\nwonderful omelet, etc. Having tasted a couple of his omelets, I have\nmy doubts. The important issue, though, is whether she believes these\nthings, not just intellectually—we can play such mind games on\nourselves—but in her heart of hearts.\nThere may be a little device Sara can use to find out how much of her\ncurrent satisfaction with Tim is real and how much is foolish consist-\nency. Accumulating psychological evidence indicates that we experience\nour feelings toward something a split second before we can intellectu-\nalize about it.21 My suspicion is that the message sent by the heart of\nhearts is a pure, basic feeling. Therefore, if we train ourselves to be at-\ntentive, we should register it ever so slightly before our cognitive appar-\natus engages. According to this approach, were Sara to ask herself the\ncrucial “Would I make the same choice again?” question, she would be\nwell advised to look for and trust the first flash of feeling she experi-\nenced in response. It would likely be the signal from her heart of hearts,\nslipping through undistorted just before the means by which she could\nkid herself flooded in.22\nI have begun using the same device myself whenever I even suspect\nI might be acting in a foolishly consistent manner. One time, for instance,\nI had stopped at the self-service pump of a filling station advertising a\nprice per gallon a couple of cents below the rate of other stations in the\narea. But with pump nozzle in hand, I noticed that the price listed on\nthe pump was two cents higher than the display sign price. When I\nmentioned the difference to a passing attendant, who I later learned\nwas the owner, he mumbled uncon-vincingly that the rates had changed\na few days ago but there hadn’t been time to correct the display. I tried\nto decide what to do. Some reasons for staying came to mind—“I really\ndo need gasoline badly.” “This pump is available, and I am in sort of\na hurry.” “I think I remember that my car runs better on this brand of\ngas.”\nI needed to determine whether those reasons were genuine or mere84 / Influence\njustifications for my decision to stop there. So I asked myself the crucial\nquestion, “Knowing what I know about the real price of this gasoline,\nif I could go back in time, would I make the same choice again?” Con-\ncentrating on the first burst of impression I sensed, the answer was\nclear and unqualified. I would have driven right past. I wouldn’t even\nhave slowed down. I knew then that without the price advantage, those\nother reasons would not have brought me there. They hadn’t created\nthe decision; the decision had created them.\nThat settled, there was another decision to be faced, though. Since I\nwas already there holding the hose, wouldn’t it be better to use it than\nto suffer the inconvenience of going elsewhere to pay the same price?\nFortunately, the station attendant-owner came over and helped me\nmake up my mind. He asked why I wasn’t pumping any gas. I told him\nI didn’t like the price discrepancy, and he said with a snarl, “Listen,\nnobody’s gonna tell me how to run my business. If you think I’m\ncheating you, just put that hose down right now and get off my property\nas fast as you can do it, bud.” Already certain he was a cheat, I was\nhappy to act consistently with my belief and his wishes. I dropped the\nhose on the spot…and drove over it on my way to the closest exit.\nSometimes consistency can be a marvelously rewarding thing.\nREADER’S REPORT\nFrom a Woman Living in Portland, Oregon\n“I was walking through downtown Portland on my way to a lunch\nappointment when a young, attractive man stopped me with a friendly\nsmile and a powerful line: ‘Excuse me, I’m involved in a contest and I\nneed a good-looking woman like yourself to help me win.’ I was truly\nskeptical, since I know there are many more attractive women than\nmyself running around; however, I was caught off guard and was\ncurious to find out what he wanted. He explained that he would receive\npoints for a contest by getting total strangers to give him a kiss. Now I\nconsider myself a fairly level-headed person who shouldn’t have be-\nlieved his line, but he was quite persistent, and since I was almost late\nfor my lunch appointment, I thought, ‘What the heck, I’ll give the guy\na kiss and get out of here.’ So I did something totally against my com-\nmon sense and pecked this total stranger on the cheek in the middle of\ndowntown Portland!\n“I thought that would be the end of it, but I soon learned that it was\njust the beginning. Much to my distress, he followed the kiss with the\nline ‘You are a great kisser, but the real contest I am involved in is to\nsell magazine subscriptions. You must be an active person. Would any\nof these magazines interest you?’ At this point I should have sluggedRobert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 85\nthe guy and walked away; but somehow, because I had complied with\nhis initial request, I felt a need to be consistent, and I complied with his\nsecond request. Yes, much to my own disbelief, I actually subscribed\nto SKI magazine (which I occasionally enjoy reading, but had no inten-\ntion of subscribing to), gave him a five-dollar initial-subscription fee\nand left as quickly as possible, feeling quite frustrated with what I had\njust done and not understanding why I had done it.\n“Although it still pains me to think about it, in reflecting on the incid-\nent after reading your book, I’ve now figured out what happened. The\nreason this tactic worked so effectively is because once small commit-\nments have been made (in this case, giving a kiss), people tend to add\njustifications to support the commitment and then are willing to commit\nthemselves further. In this situation, I justified complying with the\nsecond request because it was consistent with my initial action. If I had\nonly listened to my ‘stomach signs,’ I could have saved myself a lot of\nhumiliation.”\nBy extracting a kiss, the salesman exploited the consistency principle\nin two ways. First, by the time he asked for her aid in the magazine\ncontest, his prospect had already gone on record—with that kiss—as\nagreeing to help him win a contest. Second, it seems only natural (i.e.,\ncongruent) that if a woman feels positively enough toward a man to\nkiss him, she should feel positively toward helping him out.86 / Influence\nChapter 4\nSOCIAL PROOF\nTruths Are Us\nWhere all think alike, no one thinks very much.\n—WALTER LIPPMANN\nIDON’T KNOW ANYONE WHO LIKES CANNED LAUGHTER. IN FACT, when\nI surveyed the people who came into my office one day—several\nstudents, two telephone repairmen, a number of university professors,\nand the janitor—the reaction was invariably critical. Television, with\nits incessant system of laugh tracks and technically augmented mirth,\nreceived the most heat. The people I questioned hated canned laughter.\nThey called it stupid, phony, and obvious. Although my sample was\nsmall, I would bet that it closely reflects the negative feelings of most\nof the American public toward laugh tracks.\nWhy, then, is canned laughter so popular with television executives?\nThey have won their exalted positions and splendid salaries by knowing\nhow to give the public what it wants. Yet they religiously employ the\nlaugh tracks that their audiences find distasteful. And they do so over\nthe objections of many of their most talented artists. It is not uncommon\nfor acclaimed directors, writers, or actors to demand the elimination of\ncanned responses from the television projects they undertake. These\ndemands are only sometimes successful, and when they are, it is not\nwithout a battle.\nWhat could it be about canned laughter that is so attractive to televi-\nsion executives? Why would these shrewd and tested businessmen\nchampion a practice that their potential watchers find disagreeable and\ntheir most creative talents find personally insulting? The answer is at\nonce simple and intriguing: They know what the research says. Exper-\niments have found that the use of canned merriment causes an audience\nto laugh longer and more often when humorous material is presented\nand to rate the material as funnier. In addition, some evidence indicates\nthat canned laughter is most effective for poor jokes.1\nIn the light of these data, the actions of television executives make\nperfect sense. The introduction of laugh tracks into their comic program-\nming will increase the humorous and appreciative responses of an\naudience, even—and especially—when the material is of poor quality.\nIs it any surprise, then, that television, glutted as it is with artless situ-\nation-comedy attempts, should be saturated with canned laughter?\nThose executives know precisely what they are doing.\nBut with the mystery of the widespread use of laugh tracks solved,\nwe are left with a more perplexing question: Why does canned laughter\nwork on us the way it does? It is no longer the television executives\nwho appear peculiar; they are acting logically and in their own interests.\nInstead, it is the behavior of the audience, of you and me, that seems\nstrange. Why should we laugh more at comedy material afloat in a sea\nof mechanically fabricated merriment? And why should we think that\ncomic flotsam funnier? The executives aren’t really fooling us. Anyone\ncan recognize dubbed laughter. It is so blatant, so clearly counterfeit,\nthat there could be no confusing it with the real thing. We know full\nwell that the hilarity we hear is irrelevant to the humorous quality of\nthe joke it follows, that it is created not spontaneously by a genuine\naudience, but artificially by a technician at a control board. Yet, trans-\nparent forgery that it is, it works on us!\nTo discover why canned laughter is so effective, we first need to un-\nderstand the nature of yet another potent weapon of influence: the\nprinciple of social proof. It states that one means we use to determine\nwhat is correct is to find out what other people think is correct. The\nprinciple applies especially to the way we decide what constitutes cor-\nrect behavior. We view a behavior as more correct in a given situation\nto the degree that we see others performing it. Whether the question is\nwhat to do with an empty popcorn box in a movie theater, how fast to\ndrive on a certain stretch of highway, or how to eat the chicken at a\ndinner party, the actions of those around us will be important in defining\nthe answer.\nThe tendency to see an action as more appropriate when others are\ndoing it normally works quite well. As a rule, we will make fewer\nmistakes by acting in accord with social evidence than contrary to it.\nUsually, when a lot of people are doing something, it is the right thing\nto do. This feature of the principle of social proof is simultaneously its88 / Influence\nmajor strength and its major weakness. Like the other weapons of influ-\nence, it provides a convenient shortcut for determining how to behave\nbut, at the same time, makes one who uses the shortcut vulnerable to\nthe attacks of profiteers who lie in wait along its path.\nIn the case of canned laughter, the problem comes when we begin\nresponding to social proof in such a mindless and reflexive fashion that\nwe can be fooled by partial or fake evidence. Our folly is not that we\nuse others’ laughter to help decide what is humorous and when mirth\nis appropriate; that is in keeping with the well-founded principle of\nsocial proof. The folly is that we do so in response to patently fraudulent\nlaughter. Somehow, one disembodied feature of humor—a\nsound—works like the essence of humor. The example from Chapter\n1 of the turkey and the polecat is instructive here. Remember that be-\ncause the particular “cheep-cheep” of turkey chicks is normally associ-\nated with newborn turkeys, their mothers will display or withhold\nmaternal care solely on the basis of that sound? And remember how,\nconsequently, it was possible to trick a female turkey into mothering a\nstuffed polecat as long as the replica played the recorded “cheep-cheep”\nof a baby turkey? The simulated chick sound was enough to start the\nfemale’s mothering tape whirring.\nThe lesson of the turkey and the polecat illustrates uncomfortably\nwell the relationship between the average viewer and the laugh-track-\nplaying television executive. We have become so accustomed to taking\nthe humorous reactions of others as evidence of what deserves laughter\nthat we, too, can be made to respond to the sound and not to the sub-\nstance of the real thing. Much as a “cheep-cheep” noise removed from\nthe reality of a chick can stimulate a female turkey to mother, so can a\nrecorded “ha-ha” removed from the reality of a genuine audience\nstimulate us to laugh. The television executives are exploiting our\npreference for shortcuts, our tendency to react automatically on the\nbasis of partial evidence. They know that their tapes will cue our tapes.\nClick, whirr.\nTelevision executives are hardly alone in their use of social evidence\nfor profit. Our tendency to assume that an action is more correct if\nothers are doing it is exploited in a variety of settings. Bartenders often\n“salt” their tip jars with a few dollar bills at the beginning of the evening\nto simulate tips left by prior customers and thereby to give the impres-\nsion that tipping with folding money is proper barroom behavior.\nChurch ushers sometimes salt collection baskets for the same reason\nand with the same positive effect on proceeds. Evangelical preachers\nare known to seed their audience with “ringers,” who are rehearsed to\ncome forward at a specified time to give witness and donations. ForRobert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 89\nexample, an Arizona State University research team that infiltrated the\nBilly Graham organization reported on such advance preparations\nprior to one of his Crusade visits. “By the time Graham arrives in town\nand makes his altar call, an army of six thousand wait with instructions\non when to come forth at varying intervals to create the impression of\na spontaneous mass outpouring.”2\nAdvertisers love to inform us when a product is the “fastest-growing”\nor “largest-selling” because they don’t have to convince us directly that\nthe product is good, they need only say that many others think so,\nwhich seems proof enough. The producers of charity telethons devote\ninordinate amounts of time to the incessant listing of viewers who have\nalready pledged contributions. The message being communicated to\nthe holdouts is clear: “Look at all the people who have decided to give.\nIt must be the correct thing to do.” At the height of the disco craze, cer-\ntain discotheque owners manufactured a brand of visible social proof\nfor their clubs’ quality by creating long waiting lines outside when there\nwas plenty of room inside. Salesmen are taught to spice their pitches\nwith numerous accounts of individuals who have purchased the\nproduct. Sales and motivation consultant Cavett Robert captures the\nprinciple nicely in his advice to sales trainees: “Since 95 percent of the\npeople are imitators and only 5 percent initiators, people are persuaded\nmore by the actions of others than by any proof we can offer.”\nResearchers, too, have employed procedures based on the principle\nof social proof—sometimes with astounding results. One psychologist\nin particular, Albert Bandura, has led the way in developing such pro-\ncedures for the elimination of undesirable behavior. Bandura and his\ncolleagues have shown how people suffering from phobias can be rid\nof these extreme fears in an amazingly simple fashion. For instance, in\nan early study nursery-school-age children chosen because they were\nterrified of dogs merely watched a little boy playing happily with a dog\nfor twenty minutes a day. This exhibition produced such marked\nchanges in the reactions of the fearful children that after only four days,\n67 percent of them were willing to climb into a playpen with a dog and\nremain confined there, petting and scratching it while everyone else\nleft the room. Moreover, when the researchers tested the children’s fear\nlevels again one month later, they found that the improvement had not\nevaporated during that time; in fact, the children were more willing\nthan ever to interact with dogs.\nAn important practical discovery was made in a second study of\nchildren who were exceptionally afraid of dogs: To reduce their fears,\nit was not necessary to provide live demonstrations of another child\nplaying with a dog; film clips had the same effect. And the most effective\ntype of clips were those depicting not one but a variety of other children90 / Influence\ninteracting with their dogs; apparently the principle of social proof\nworks best when the proof is provided by the actions of a lot of other\npeople.3\nThe powerful influence of filmed examples in changing the behavior\nof children can be used as therapy for various problems. Some striking\nevidence is available in the research of psychologist Robert O’Connor\non socially withdrawn preschool children. We have all seen children\nof this sort, terribly shy, standing alone at the fringes of the games and\ngroupings of their peers. O’Connor worried that a long-term pattern\nof isolation was forming, even at an early age, that would create persist-\nent difficulties in social comfort and adjustment through adulthood. In\nan attempt to reverse the pattern, O’Connor made a film containing\neleven different scenes in a nursery-school setting. Each scene began\nby showing a different solitary child watching some ongoing social\nactivity and then actively joining the activity, to everyone’s enjoyment.\nO’Connor selected a group of the most severely withdrawn children\nfrom four preschools and showed them his film. The impact was im-\npressive. The isolates immediately began to interact with their peers at\na level equal to that of the normal children in the schools. Even more\nastonishing was what O’Connor found when he returned to observe\nsix weeks later. While the withdrawn children who had not seen\nO’Connor’s film remained as isolated as ever, those who had viewed it\nwere now leading their schools in amount of social activity. It seems\nthat this twenty-three-minute movie, viewed just once, was enough to\nreverse a potential pattern of lifelong maladaptive behavior. Such is\nthe potency of the principle of social proof.4\nWhen it comes to illustrations of the strength of social proof, there is\none that is far and away my favorite. Several features account for its\nappeal: It offers a superb example of the much underused method of\nparticipant observation, in which a scientist studies a process by becom-\ning immersed in its natural occurrence; it provides information of in-\nterest to such diverse groups as historians, psychologists, and theolo-\ngians; and, most important, it shows how social evidence can be used\non us—not by others, but by ourselves—to assure us that what we\nprefer to be true will seem to be true.\nThe story is an old one, requiring an examination of ancient data, for\nthe past is dotted with millennial religious movements. Various sects\nand cults have prophesied that on one or another particular date there\nwould arrive a period of redemption and great happiness for those who\nbelieved in the group’s teachings. In each instance it has been predicted\nthat the beginning of the time of salvation would be marked by an im-\nportant and undeniable event, usually the cataclysmic end of the world.Robert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 91\nOf course, these predictions have invariably proved false. To the acute\ndismay of the members of such groups, the end has never appeared as\nscheduled.\nBut immediately following the obvious failure of the prophecy, history\nrecords an enigmatic pattern. Rather than disbanding in disillusion, the\ncultists often become strengthened in their convictions. Risking the ri-\ndicule of the populace, they take to the streets, publicly asserting their\ndogma and seeking converts with a fervor that is intensified, not dimin-\nished, by the clear disconfirmation of a central belief. So it was with the\nMontanists of second-century Turkey, with the Anabaptists of sixteenth-\ncentury Holland, with the Sabbataists of seventeenth-century Izmir,\nwith the Millerites of nineteenth-century America. And, thought a trio\nof interested social scientists, so it might be with a doomsday cult based\nin modern-day Chicago. The scientists—Leon Festinger, Henry Riecken,\nand Stanley Schachter—who were then colleagues at the University of\nMinnesota, heard about the Chicago group and felt it worthy of close\nstudy. Their decision to investigate by joining the group, incognito, as\nnew believers and by placing additional paid observers among its ranks\nresulted in a remarkably rich firsthand account of the goings-on before\nand after the day of predicted catastrophe.5\nThe cult of believers was small, never numbering more than thirty\nmembers. Its leaders were a middle-aged man and woman, whom the\nresearchers renamed, for purposes of publication, Dr. Thomas Arm-\nstrong and Mrs. Marian Keech. Dr. Armstrong, a physician on the staff\nof a college student health service, had a long-held interest in mysticism,\nthe occult, and flying saucers; as such he served as a respected authority\non these subjects for the group. Mrs. Keech, though, was the center of\nattention and activity. Earlier in the year she had begun to receive\nmessages from spiritual beings, whom she called the Guardians, located\non other planets. It was these messages, flowing through Marian Keech’s\nhand via the device of “automatic writing,” that were to form the bulk\nof the cult’s religious belief system. The teachings of the Guardians\nwere loosely linked to traditional Christian thought. No wonder that\none of the Guardians, Sananda, eventually “revealed” himself as the\ncurrent embodiment of Jesus.\nThe transmissions from the Guardians, always the subjects of much\ndiscussion and interpretation among the group, gained new significance\nwhen they began to foretell a great impending disaster—a flood that\nwould begin in the Western Hemisphere and eventually engulf the\nworld. Although the cultists were understandably alarmed at first,\nfurther messages assured them that they and all those who believed in\nthe Lessons sent through Mrs. Keech would survive. Before the calamity,\nspacemen were to arrive and carry off the believers in flying saucers to92 / Influence\na place of safety, presumably on another planet. Very little detail was\nprovided about the rescue except that the believers were to make\nthemselves ready for pickup by rehearsing certain passwords to be ex-\nchanged (“I left my hat at home.” “What is your question?” “I am my\nown porter.”) and by removing all metal from their clothes—because\nthe wearing or carrying of metal made saucer travel “extremely danger-\nous.”\nAs Festinger, Riecken, and Schachter observed the preparations\nduring the weeks prior to the flood date, they noted with special interest\ntwo significant aspects of the members’ behavior. First, the level of\ncommitment to the cult’s belief system was very high. In anticipation\nof their departure from doomed Earth, irrevocable steps were taken by\nthe group members. Most had incurred the opposition of family and\nfriends to their beliefs but had persisted nonetheless in their convictions,\noften when it meant losing the affections of these others. In fact, several\nof the members were threatened by neighbors or family with legal ac-\ntions designed to have them declared insane. In Dr. Armstrong’s case,\na motion was filed by his sister to have his two younger children taken\naway. Many believers quit their jobs or neglected their studies to devote\nfull time to the movement. Some even gave or threw away their personal\nbelongings, expecting them shortly to be of no use. These were people\nwhose certainty that they had the truth allowed them to withstand\nenormous social, economic, and legal pressures and whose commitment\nto their dogma grew as each pressure was resisted.\nThe second significant aspect of the believers’ preflood actions was\na curious form of inaction. For individuals so clearly convinced of the\nvalidity of their creed, they did surprisingly little to spread the word.\nAlthough they did initially make public the news of the coming disaster,\nthere was no attempt to seek converts, to proselyte actively. They were\nwilling to sound the alarm and to counsel those who voluntarily respon-\nded to it, but that was all.\nThe group’s distaste for recruitment efforts was evident in various\nways besides the lack of personal persuasion attempts. Secrecy was\nmaintained in many matters—extra copies of the Lessons were burned,\npasswords and secret signs were instituted, the contents of certain\nprivate tape recordings were not to be discussed with outsiders (so\nsecret were the tapes that even longtime believers were prohibited from\ntaking notes of them). Publicity was avoided. As the day of disaster\napproached, increasing numbers of newspaper, television, and radio\nreporters converged on the group’s headquarters in the Keech house.\nFor the most part, these people were turned away or ignored. The most\nfrequent answer to their questions was, “No comment.” Although dis-\ncouraged for a time, the media representatives returned with a ven-Robert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 93\ngeance when Dr. Armstrong’s religious activities caused him to be fired\nfrom his post on the college health service staff; one especially persistent\nnewsman had to be threatened with a lawsuit. A similar siege was re-\npelled on the eve of the flood when a swarm of reporters pushed and\npestered the believers for information. Afterward, the researchers\nsummarized the group’s preflood stance on public exposure and recruit-\nment in respectful tones: “Exposed to a tremendous burst of publicity,\nthey had made every attempt to dodge fame; given dozens of opportun-\nities to proselyte, they had remained evasive and secretive and behaved\nwith an almost superior indifference.”\nEventually, when all the reporters and would-be converts had been\ncleared from the house, the believers began making their final prepara-\ntions for the arrival of the spaceship scheduled for midnight that night.\nThe scene, as viewed by Festinger, Riecken, and Schachter, must have\nseemed like absurdist theater. Otherwise ordinary people—housewives,\ncollege students, a high-school boy, a publisher, an M.D., a hardware-\nstore clerk and his mother—were participating earnestly in tragic\ncomedy. They took direction from a pair of members who were period-\nically in touch with the Guardians; Marian Keech’s written messages\nfrom Sananda were being supplemented that evening by “the Bertha,”\na former beautician through whose tongue the “Creator” gave instruc-\ntion. They rehearsed their lines diligently, calling out in chorus the re-\nsponses to be made before entering the rescue saucer, “I am my own\nporter.” “I am my own pointer.” They discussed seriously whether the\nmessage from a caller identifying himself as Captain Video—a TV space\ncharacter of the time—was properly interpreted as a prank or a coded\ncommunication from their rescuers. And they performed in costume.\nIn keeping with the admonition to carry nothing metallic aboard the\nsaucer, the believers wore clothing that had been cut open to allow the\nmetal pieces to be torn out. The metal eyelets in their shoes had been\nripped away. The women were braless or wore brassieres whose metal\nstays had been removed. The men had yanked the zippers out of their\npants, which were supported by lengths of rope in place of belts.\nThe group’s fanaticism concerning the removal of all metal was\nvividly experienced by one of the researchers who remarked, twenty-\nfive minutes before midnight, that he had forgotten to extract the zipper\nfrom his trousers. As the observers tell it, “this knowledge produced a\nnear panic reaction. He was rushed into the bedroom where Dr. Arm-\nstrong, his hands trembling and his eyes darting to the clock every few\nseconds, slashed out the zipper with a razor blade and wrenched its\nclasps free with wire-cutters.” The hurried operation finished, the re-\nsearcher was returned to the living room a slightly less metallic but,\none supposes, much paler man.94 / Influence\nAs the time appointed for their departure grew very close, the believ-\ners settled into a lull of soundless anticipation. With trained scientists\non site, we are afforded a detailed account of the events that transpired\nduring this momentous period in the life of the group:\nThe last ten minutes were tense ones for the group in the living\nroom. They had nothing to do but sit and wait, their coats in their\nlaps. In the tense silence two clocks ticked loudly, one about ten\nminutes faster than the other. When the faster of the two pointed\nto twelve-five, one of the observers remarked aloud on the fact. A\nchorus of people replied that midnight had not yet come. Bob\nEastman affirmed that the slower clock was correct; he had set it\nhimself only that afternoon. It showed only four minutes before\nmidnight.\nThese four minutes passed in complete silence except for a single\nutterance. When the [slower] clock on the mantel showed only one\nminute remaining before the guide to the saucer was due, Marian\nexclaimed in a strained, high-pitched voice: “And not a plan has\ngone astray!” The clock chimed twelve, each stroke painfully clear\nin the expectant hush. The believers sat motionless.\nOne might have expected some visible reaction. Midnight had\npassed and nothing had happened. The cataclysm itself was less\nthan seven hours away. But there was little to see in the reactions\nof the people in that room. There was no talking, no sound. People\nsat stock-still, their faces seemingly frozen and expressionless. Mark\nPost was the only person who even moved. He lay down on the\nsofa and closed his eyes but did not sleep. Later, when spoken to,\nhe answered monosyllabically but otherwise lay immobile. The\nothers showed nothing on the surface, although it became clear\nlater that they had been hit hard.\nGradually, painfully, an atmosphere of despair and confusion\nsettled over the group. They reexamined the prediction and the\naccompanying messages. Dr. Armstrong and Mrs. Keech reiterated\ntheir faith. The believers mulled over their predicament and dis-\ncarded explanation after explanation as unsatisfactory. At one point,\ntoward 4 A.M., Mrs. Keech broke down and cried bitterly. She knew,\nshe sobbed, that there were some who were beginning to doubt\nbut that the group must beam light to those who needed it most\nand that the group must hold together. The rest of the believers\nwere losing their composure, too. They were all visibly shaken and\nmany were close to tears. It was now almost 4:30 A.M., and still no\nway of handling the disconfirmation had been found. By now, too,Robert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 95\nmost of the group were talking openly about the failure of the escort\nto come at midnight. The group seemed near dissolution.\nIn the midst of this gathering doubt, as cracks crawled through the\nbelievers’ confidence, the researchers witnessed a pair of remarkable\nincidents, one after another. The first occurred at about 4:45 A.M., when\nMarian Keech’s hand suddenly leapt to the task of transcribing through\n“automatic writing” the text of a holy message from above. When read\naloud, the communication proved to be an elegant explanation for the\nevents of that night. “The little group, sitting alone all night long, had\nspread so much light that God had saved the world from destruction.”\nAlthough neat and efficient, this explanation was not wholly satisfying\nby itself; for example, after hearing it, one member simply rose, put on\nhis hat and coat, and left. Something additional was needed to restore\nthe believers to their previous levels of faith.\nIt was at this point that the second notable incident occurred to meet\nthat need. Once again, the words of those who were present offer a\nvivid description:\nThe atmosphere in the group changed abruptly and so did their\nbehavior. Within minutes after she had read the message explaining\nthe disconfirmation, Mrs. Keech received another message instruct-\ning her to publicize the explanation. She reached for the telephone\nand began dialing the number of a newspaper. While she was\nwaiting to be connected, someone asked: “Marian, is this the first\ntime you have called the newspaper yourself?” Her reply was im-\nmediate: “Oh, yes, this is the first time I have ever called them. I\nhave never had anything to tell them before, but now I feel it is\nurgent.” The whole group could have echoed her feelings, for they\nall felt a sense of urgency. As soon as Marian had finished her call,\nthe other members took turns telephoning newspapers, wire ser-\nvices, radio stations, and national magazines to spread the explan-\nation of the failure of the flood. In their desire to spread the word\nquickly and resoundingly, the believers now opened for public at-\ntention matters that had been thus far utterly secret. Where only\nhours earlier they had shunned newspaper reporters and felt that\nthe attention they were getting in the press was painful, they now\nbecame avid seekers for publicity.\nNot only had the long-standing policies concerning secrecy and\npublicity done an about-face, so, too, had the group’s attitude toward\npotential converts. Whereas likely recruits who previously visited the\nhouse had been mostly ignored, turned away, or treated with casual\nattention, the day following the disconfirmation saw a different story.96 / Influence\nAll callers were admitted, all questions were answered, attempts were\nmade to proselyte all such visitors. The members’ unprecedented will-\ningness to accommodate possible new recruits was perhaps best dem-\nonstrated when nine high-school students arrived on the following\nnight to speak with Mrs. Keech.\nThey found her at the telephone deep in a discussion of flying\nsaucers with a caller whom, it later turned out, she believed to be\na spaceman. Eager to continue talking to him and at the same time\nanxious to keep her new guests, Marian simply included them in\nthe conversation and, for more than an hour, chatted alternately\nwith her guests in the living room and the “spaceman” on the\nother end of the telephone. So intent was she on proselyting that\nshe seemed unable to let any opportunity go by.\nTo what can we attribute the believers’ radical turnabout? In the space\nof a few hours, they went from clannish and taciturn hoarders of the\nWord to expansive and eager disseminators of it. And what could have\npossessed them to choose such an ill-timed instant—when the failure\nof the flood was likely to cause nonbelievers to view the group and its\ndogma as laughable?\nThe crucial event occurred sometime during “the night of the flood,”\nwhen it became increasingly clear that the prophecy would not be ful-\nfilled. Oddly, it was not their prior certainty that drove the members\nto propagate the faith; it was an encroaching sense of uncertainty. It\nwas the dawning realization that if the spaceship and flood predictions\nwere wrong, so might be the entire belief system on which they rested.\nFor those huddled in the Keech living room, that growing possibility\nmust have seemed hideous.\nThe group members had gone too far, given up too much for their\nbeliefs to see them destroyed; the shame, the economic cost, the mockery\nwould be too great to bear. The overarching need of the cultists to cling\nto those beliefs seeps poignantly from their own words: From a young\nwoman with a three-year-old child:\nI have to believe the flood is coming on the twenty-first because\nI’ve spent all my money. I quit my job, I quit computer school…. I\nhave to believe.\nAnd from Dr. Armstrong to one of the researchers four hours after\nthe failure of the saucermen to arrive:\nI’ve had to go a long way. I’ve given up just about everything. I’ve\ncut every tie. I’ve burned every bridge. I’ve turned my back on theRobert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 97\nworld. I can’t afford to doubt. I have to believe. And there isn’t any\nother truth.\nImagine the corner in which Dr. Armstrong and his followers found\nthemselves as morning approached. So massive was the commitment\nto their beliefs that no other truth was tolerable. Yet that set of beliefs\nhad just taken a merciless pounding from physical reality: No saucer\nhad landed, no spacemen had knocked, no flood had come, nothing\nhad happened as prophesied. Since the only acceptable form of truth\nhad been undercut by physical proof, there was but one way out of the\ncorner for the group. They had to establish another type of proof for\nthe validity of their beliefs: social proof.\nThis, then, explains their sudden shift from secretive conspirators to\nzealous missionaries. And it explains the curious timing of the\nshift—precisely when a direct disconfirmation of their beliefs had\nrendered them least convincing to outsiders. It was necessary to risk\nthe scorn and derision of the nonbelievers because publicity and recruit-\nment efforts provided the only remaining hope. If they could spread\nthe Word, if they could inform the uninformed, if they could persuade\nthe skeptics, and if, by so doing, they could win new converts, their\nthreatened but treasured beliefs would become truer. The principle of\nsocial proof says so: The greater the number of people who find any\nidea correct, the more the idea will be correct. The group’s assignment\nwas clear; since the physical evidence could not be changed, the social\nevidence had to be. Convince and ye shall be convinced!6\nCAUSE OF DEATH: UNCERTAIN(TY)\nAll the weapons of influence discussed in this book work better under\nsome conditions than under others. If we are to defend ourselves ad-\nequately against any such weapon, it is vital that we know its optimal\noperating conditions in order to recognize when we are most vulnerable\nto its influence. In the case of the principle of social proof, we have\nalready had a hint of one time when it works best. Among the Chicago\nbelievers, it was a sense of shaken confidence that triggered their craving\nfor converts. In general, when we are unsure of ourselves, when the\nsituation is unclear or ambiguous, when uncertainty reigns, we are\nmost likely to look to and accept the actions of others as correct.\nIn the process of examining the reactions of other people to resolve\nour uncertainty, however, we are likely to overlook a subtle but import-\nant fact. Those people are probably examining the social evidence, too.\nEspecially in an ambiguous situation, the tendency for everyone to be\nlooking to see what everyone else is doing can lead to a fascinating98 / Influence\nphenomenon called “pluralistic ignorance.” A thorough understanding\nof the pluralistic ignorance phenomenon helps immeasurably to explain\na regular occurrence in our country that has been termed both a riddle\nand a national disgrace: the failure of entire groups of bystanders to\naid victims in agonizing need of help.\nThe classic example of such bystander inaction and the one that has\nproduced the most debate in journalistic, political, and scientific circles\nbegan as an ordinary homicide case in the borough of Queens in New\nYork City. A woman in her late twenties, Catherine Genovese, was\nkilled in a late-night attack on her home street as she returned from\nwork. Murder is never an act to be passed off lightly, but in a city the\nsize and tenor of New York, the Genovese incident warranted no more\nspace than a fraction of a column in The New York Times. Catherine\nGenovese’s story would have died with her on that day in March 1964\nif it hadn’t been for a mistake.\nThe metropolitan editor of the Times, A. M. Rosenthal, happened to\nbe having lunch with the city police commissioner a week later.\nRosenthal asked the commissioner about a different Queens-based\nhomicide, and the commissioner, thinking he was being questioned\nabout the Genovese case, revealed something staggering that had been\nuncovered by the police investigation. It was something that left\neveryone who heard it, the commissioner included, aghast and grasping\nfor explanations. Catherine Genovese had not experienced a quick,\nmuffled death. It had been a long, loud, tortured, public event. Her as-\nsailant had chased and attacked her in the street three times over a\nperiod of thirty-five minutes before his knife finally silenced her cries\nfor help. Incredibly, thirty-eight of her neighbors watched the events\nof her death unfold from the safety of their apartment windows without\nso much as lifting a finger to call the police.\nRosenthal, a former Pulitzer Prize—winning reporter, knew a story\nwhen he heard one. On the day of his lunch with the commissioner, he\nassigned a reporter to investigate the “bystander angle” of the Genovese\nincident. Within a week, the Times published a long, page 1 article that\nwas to create a swirl of controversy and speculation. The first few\nparagraphs of that report provide the tone and focus of the burgeoning\nstory:\nFor more than half an hour thirty-eight respectable, law-abiding\ncitizens in Queens watched a killer stalk and stab a woman in three\nseparate attacks in Kew Gardens.\nTwice the sound of their voices and the sudden glow of their\nbedroom lights interrupted him and frightened him off. Each time\nhe returned, sought her out, and stabbed her again. Not one personRobert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 99\ntelephoned the police during the assault; one witness called after\nthe woman was dead.\nThat was two weeks ago today. But Assistant Chief Inspector\nFrederick M. Lussen, in charge of the borough’s detectives and a\nveteran of twenty-five years of homicide investigations, is still\nshocked.\nHe can give a matter-of-fact recitation of many murders. But the\nKew Gardens slaying baffles him—not because it is a murder, but\nbecause “good people” failed to call the police.\nAs with Assistant Chief Inspector Lussen, shock and bafflement were\nthe standard reactions of almost everyone who learned the story’s de-\ntails. The shock struck first, leaving the police, the news-people, and\nthe reading public stunned. The bafflement followed quickly. How\ncould thirty-eight “good people” fail to act under those circumstances?\nNo one could understand it. Even the murder witnesses themselves\nwere bewildered. “I don’t know,” they answered one after another. “I\njust don’t know.” A few offered weak reasons for their inaction. For\nexample, two or three people explained that they were “afraid” or “did\nnot want to get involved.” But these reasons do not stand up to close\nscrutiny: A simple anonymous call to the police could have saved\nCatherine Genovese without threatening the witness’s future safety or\nfree time. No, it wasn’t the observers’ fear or reluctance to complicate\ntheir lives that explained their lack of action; something else was going\non there that even they could not fathom.\nConfusion, though, does not make for good news copy. So the press\nas well as the other media—several papers, TV stations, and magazines\nwere pursuing follow-up stories by now—emphasized the only explan-\nation available at the time: The witnesses, no different from the rest of\nus, hadn’t cared enough to get involved. We were becoming a nation\nof selfish, insensitive people. The rigors of modern life, especially city\nlife, were hardening us. We were becoming “The Cold Society,” unfeel-\ning and indifferent to the plight of our fellow citizens.\nIn support of this interpretation, news stories began appearing regu-\nlarly in which various kinds of public apathy were detailed. The Times\nactually appears to have developed an apathy “beat” for a period fol-\nlowing the Genovese revelations. Also supporting such an interpretation\nwere the remarks of a range of armchair social commentators, who, as\na breed, seem never to admit to bafflement when speaking to the press.\nThey, too, saw the Genovese case as having large-scale social signific-\nance. All used the word “apathy,” which, it is interesting to note, had\nbeen in the headline of the Times’s front-page story, although they ac-\ncounted for the apathy differently. One attributed it to the effects of TV100 / Influence\nviolence, another to repressed aggressiveness, but most implicated the\n“depersonalization” of urban life with its “megalopolitan societies”\nand its “alienation of the individual from the group.” Even Rosenthal,\nthe newsman who first broke the story and who ulti-mately made it\nthe subject of a book, subscribed to the city-caused apathy theory.\nNobody can say why the thirty-eight did not lift the phone while\nMiss Genovese was being attacked, since they cannot say them-\nselves. It can be assumed, however, that their apathy was indeed\none of the big-city variety. It is almost a matter of psychological\nsurvival, if one is surrounded and pressed by millions of people,\nto prevent them from constantly impinging on you, and the only\nway to do this is to ignore them as often as possible. Indifference\nto one’s neighbor and his troubles is a conditioned reflex in life in\nNew York as it is in other big cities.7\nAs the Genovese story grew—aside from Rosenthal’s book, it became\nthe focus of numerous newspaper and magazine pieces, several televi-\nsion-news documentaries, and an off-Broadway play—it attracted the\nprofessional attention of a pair of New York-based psychology profess-\nors, Bibb Latané and John Darley. They examined the reports of the\nGenovese incident and, on the basis of their knowledge of social psy-\nchology, hit on what had seemed the most unlikely explanation of all—it\nwas that thirty-eight witnesses were present. Previous accounts of the\nstory had invariably emphasized that no action was taken, even though\nthirty-eight individuals had looked on. Latané and Darley suggested\nthat no one had helped precisely because there were so many observers.\nThe psychologists speculated that, for at least two reasons, a bystander\nto an emergency would be unlikely to help when there were a number\nof other bystanders present. The first reason is fairly straightforward.\nWith several potential helpers around, the personal responsibility of\neach individual is reduced: “Perhaps someone else will give or call for\naid, perhaps someone else already has.” So with everyone thinking that\nsomeone else will help or has helped, no one does.\nThe second reason is the more psychologically intriguing one; it is\nfounded on the principle of social proof and involves the pluralistic\nignorance effect. Very often an emergency is not obviously an emer-\ngency. Is the man lying in the alley a heart-attack victim or a drunk\nsleeping one off? Are the sharp sounds from the street gunshots or truck\nbackfires? Is the commotion next door an assault requiring the police\nor an especially loud marital spat where intervention would be inappro-\npriate and unwelcome? What is going on? In times of such uncertainty,\nthe natural tendency is to look around at the actions of others for clues.Robert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 101\nWe can learn, from the way the other witnesses are reacting, whether\nthe event is or is not an emergency.\nWhat is easy to forget, though, is that everybody else observing the\nevent is likely to be looking for social evidence, too. And because we\nall prefer to appear poised and unflustered among others, we are likely\nto search for that evidence placidly, with brief, camouflaged glances at\nthose around us. Therefore everyone is likely to see everyone else\nlooking unruffled and failing to act. As a result, and by the principle of\nsocial proof, the event will be roundly interpreted as a nonemergency.\nThis, according to Latané and Darley, is the state of pluralistic ignorance\n“in which each person decides that since nobody is concerned, nothing\nis wrong. Meanwhile, the danger may be mounting to the point where\na single individual, uninfluenced by the seeming calm of others, would\nreact.”8\nThe fascinating upshot of Latané and Darley’s reasoning is that, for\nthe emergency victim, the idea of “safety in numbers” may often be\ncompletely wrong. It might be that someone in need of emergency aid\nwould have a better chance of survival if a single bystander, rather than\na crowd, was present. To test this unusual thesis, Darley, Latané, their\nstudents and colleagues performed a systematic and impressive program\nof research that produced a clear set of findings. Their basic procedure\nwas to stage emergency events that were observed either by a single\nindividual or by a group of people. They then recorded the number of\ntimes the emergency victim received help under those circumstances.\nIn their first experiment, a New York college student who appeared to\nbe having an epileptic seizure received help 85 percent of the time when\nthere was a single bystander present but only 31 percent of the time\nwith five bystanders present. With almost all the single bystanders\nhelping, it becomes difficult to argue that ours is “The Cold Society”\nwhere no one cares for suffering others. Obviously it was something\nabout the presence of other bystanders that reduced helping to shameful\nlevels.\nOther studies have examined the importance of social proof in causing\nwidespread witness “apathy.” They have done so by planting within\na group of witnesses to a possible emergency people who are rehearsed\nto act as if no emergency were occurring. For instance, in another New\nYork—based experiment, 75 percent of lone individuals who observed\nsmoke seeping from under a door reported the leak; however, when\nsimilar leaks were observed by three-person groups, the smoke was\nreported only 38 percent of the time. The smallest number of bystanders\ntook action, though, when the three-person groups included two indi-\nviduals who had been coached to ignore the smoke; under those condi-\ntions, the leaks were reported only 10 percent of the time. In a similar102 / Influence\nstudy conducted in Toronto, single bystanders provided emergency\naid 90 percent of the time, whereas such aid occurred in only 16 percent\nof the cases when a bystander was in the presence of two other\nbystanders who remained passive.\nAfter more than a decade of such research, social scientists now have\na good idea of when a bystander will offer emergency aid. First, and\ncontrary to the view that we have become a society of callous, uncaring\npeople, once witnesses are convinced that an emergency situation exists,\naid is very likely. Under these conditions, the numbers of bystanders\nwho either intervene themselves or summon help is quite comforting.\nFor example, in four separate experiments done in Florida, accident\nscenes involving a maintenance man were staged. When it was clear\nthat the man was hurt and required assistance, he was helped 100 per-\ncent of the time in two of the experiments. In the other two experiments,\nwhere helping involved contact with potentially dangerous electrical\nwires, the victim still received bystander aid in 90 percent of the in-\nstances. In addition, these extremely high levels of assistance occurred\nwhether the witnesses observed the event singly or in groups.9\nThe situation becomes very different when, as in many cases,\nbystanders cannot be sure that the event they are witnessing is an\nemergency. Then a victim is much more likely to be helped by a lone\nbystander than by a group, especially if the people in the group are\nstrangers to one another. It seems that the pluralistic ignorance effect\nis strongest among strangers: Because we like to look poised and\nsophisticated in public and because we are unfamiliar with the reactions\nof those we do not know, we are unlikely to give off or correctly read\nexpressions of concern when in a grouping of strangers. Therefore, a\npossible emergency becomes viewed as a nonemergency, and the victim\nsuffers.10\nA close look at this set of research findings reveals an enlightening\npattern. All the conditions that decrease an emergency victim’s chances\nfor bystander aid exist normally and innocently in the city: (1) In contrast\nto rural areas, cities are more clamorous, distracting, rapidly changing\nplaces where it is difficult to be certain of the nature of the events one\nencounters. (2) Urban environments are more populous, by their nature;\nconsequently, people are more likely to be with others when witnessing\na potential emergency situation. (3) City dwellers know a much smaller\npercentage of fellow residents than do people who live in small towns;\ntherefore, city dwellers are more likely to find themselves in a group\nof strangers when observing an emergency.\nThese three natural characteristics of urban environments—their\nconfusion, their populousness, and their low levels of acquaintance-\nship—fit in very well with the factors shown by research to decreaseRobert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 103\nbystander aid. Without ever having to resort to such sinister concepts\nas “urban depersonalization” and “megalopolitan alienation,” then, we\ncan explain why so many instances of bystander inaction occur in our\ncities.\nDevictimizing Yourself\nBut explaining the dangers of modern urban life in less ominous terms\ndoes not dispel them. And as the world’s populations move increasingly\nto the cities—half of all humanity will be city dwellers within ten\nyears—there will be a growing need to reduce those dangers. Fortu-\nnately, our newfound understanding of the bystander “apathy” process\noffers real hope. Armed with this scientific knowledge, an emergency\nvictim can increase enormously the chances of receiving aid from others.\nThe key is the realization that groups of bystanders fail to help because\nthe bystanders are unsure rather than unkind. They don’t help because\nthey are unsure of whether an emergency actually exists and whether\nthey are responsible for taking action. When they are sure of their re-\nsponsibilities for intervening in a clear emergency, people are exceed-\ningly responsive!\nOnce it is understood that the enemy is not some unmanageable so-\ncietal condition like urban depersonalization but is, instead, the simple\nstate of uncertainty, it becomes possible for emergency victims to take\nspecific steps to protect themselves by reducing the bystanders’ uncer-\ntainty. Imagine, for example, you are spending a summer afternoon at\na music concert in the park. As the concert ends and people begin\nleaving, you notice a slight numbness in one arm but dismiss it as\nnothing to be alarmed about. Yet, while moving with the crowd to the\ndistant parking areas, you feel the numbness spreading down to your\nhand and up one side of your face. Feeling disoriented, you decide to\nsit against a tree for a moment to rest. Soon you realize that something\nis drastically wrong. Sitting down has not helped; in fact, the control\nand coordination of your muscles has worsened to the point that you\nare starting to have difficulty moving your mouth and tongue to speak.\nYou try to get up but can’t. A terrifying thought slashes to mind: “Oh,\nGod, I’m having a stroke!” Groups of people are passing by and most\nare paying you no attention. The few who notice the odd way you are\nslumped against the tree or the strange look on your face check the social\nevidence around them and, seeing that no one else is reacting with\nconcern, walk on past convinced that nothing is wrong.\nWere you to find yourself in such a predicament, what could you do\nto overcome the odds against receiving help? Because your physical\nabilities would be deteriorating, time would be crucial. If, before you104 / Influence\ncould summon aid, you lost your speech or mobility or consciousness,\nyour chances for assistance and for recovery would plunge drastically.\nIt would be essential to try to request help quickly. But what would the\nmost effective form of that request be? Moans, groans, or outcries\nprobably would not do. They might bring you some attention, but they\nwould not provide enough information to assure passersby that a true\nemergency existed.\nIf mere outcries are unlikely to produce help from the passing crowd,\nperhaps you should be more specific. Indeed, you need to do more than\ntry to gain attention; you should call out clearly your need for assistance.\nYou must not allow bystanders to define your situation as a nonemer-\ngency. Use the word “Help” to cry out your need for emergency aid.\nAnd don’t worry about being wrong. Embarrassment is a villain to be\ncrushed here. In the context of a possible stroke, you cannot afford to\nbe worried about the awkwardness of overestimating your problem.\nThe difference in cost is that between a moment of embarrassment and\npossible death or lifelong paralysis.\nBut even a resounding call for help is not your most effective tactic.\nAlthough it may reduce bystanders’ doubts about whether a real\nemergency exists, it will not remove several other important uncertain-\nties within each onlooker’s mind: What kind of aid is required here?\nShould I be the one to provide the aid, or should someone more qualified\ndo it? Has someone else already gone to get professional help, or is it\nmy responsibility? While the bystanders stand gawking at you and\ngrappling with these questions, time vital to your survival could be\nslipping away.\nClearly, then, as a victim you must do more than alert bystanders to\nyour need for emergency assistance; you must also remove their uncer-\ntainties about how that assistance should be provided and who should\nprovide it. But what would be the most efficient and reliable way to do\nso?\nBased on the research findings we have seen, my advice would be to\nisolate one individual from the crowd: Stare, speak, and point directly\nat that person and no one else: “You, sir, in the blue jacket, I need help.\nCall an ambulance.” With that one utterance you should dispel all the\nuncertainties that might prevent or delay help. With that one statement\nyou will have put the man in the blue jacket in the role of “rescuer.”\nHe should now understand that emergency aid is needed; he should\nunderstand that he, not someone else, is responsible for providing the\naid; and, finally, he should understand exactly how to provide it. All\nthe scientific evidence indicates that the result should be quick, effective\nassistance.Robert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 105\nIn general, then, your best strategy when in need of emergency help\nis to reduce the uncertainties of those around you concerning your\ncondition and their responsibilities. Be as precise as possible about your\nneed for aid. Do not allow bystanders to come to their own conclusions\nbecause, especially in a crowd, the principle of social proof and the\nconsequent pluralistic ignorance effect might well cause them to view\nyour situation as a nonemergency.\nAnd request assistance of a single individual from the group of on-\nlookers. Fight the natural tendency to make a general request for help.\nPick out one person and assign the task to that individual. Otherwise,\nit is too easy for everyone in the crowd to assume that someone else\nshould help, will help, or has helped. Of all the techniques in this book\ndesigned to produce compliance with a request, this one may be the\nmost important to remember. After all, the failure of your request for\nemergency aid could have severe personal consequences.\nNot long ago, I received some firsthand evidence on this point. I was\ninvolved in a rather serious automobile collision. Both I and the other\ndriver were plainly hurt: He was slumped, unconscious, over his\nsteering wheel while I managed to stagger, bloody, from behind mine.\nThe accident had occurred in the center of an intersection in full view\nof several individuals stopped in their cars at the traffic light. As I knelt\nin the road beside my door, trying to clear my head, the light changed\nand the waiting cars began to roll slowly through the intersection; their\ndrivers gawked but did not stop.\nI remember thinking, “Oh no, it’s happening just like the research\nsays. They’re all passing by!” I consider it fortunate that, as a social\npsychologist, I knew enough about the bystander studies to have that\nparticular thought. By thinking of my predicament in terms of the re-\nsearch findings, I knew exactly what to do. Pulling myself up so I could\nbe seen clearly, I pointed at the driver of one car: “Call the police.” To\na second and a third driver, pointing directly each time: “Pull over, we\nneed help.” The responses of these people were instantaneous. They\nsummoned a police car and ambulance immediately, they used their\nhandkerchiefs to blot the blood from my face, they put a jacket under\nmy head, they volunteered to serve as witnesses to the accident; one\neven offered to ride with me to the hospital.\nNot only was this help rapid and solicitous, it was infectious. After\ndrivers entering the intersection from the other direction saw cars\nstopping for me, they stopped and began tending to the other victim.\nThe principle of social proof was working for us now. The trick had\nbeen to get the ball rolling in the direction of aid. Once that was accom-\nplished, I was able to relax and let the bystanders’ genuine concern and\nsocial proof’s natural momentum do the rest.106 / Influence\nMONKEY ME, MONKEY DO\nA bit earlier we stated that the principle of social proof, like all other\nweapons of influence, works better under some conditions than under\nothers. We have already explored one of those conditions: uncertainty.\nWithout question, when people are uncertain, they are more likely to\nuse others’ actions to decide how they themselves should act. But, in\naddition, there is another important working condition: similarity. The\nprinciple of social proof operates most powerfully when we are ob-\nserving the behavior of people just like us. It is the conduct of such\npeople that gives us the greatest insight into what constitutes correct\nbehavior for ourselves. Therefore we are more inclined to follow the\nlead of a similar individual than a dissimilar one.\nThat is why I believe we are seeing an increasing number of average-\nperson-on-the-street testimonials on TV these days. Advertisers now\nknow that one successful way to sell a product to ordinary viewers\n(who compose the largest potential market) is to demonstrate that other\n“ordinary” people like and use it. So whether the product is a brand of\nsoft drink, or a pain reliever, or a laundry detergent, we hear volleys\nof praise from John or Mary Every-person.\nMore compelling evidence for the importance of similarity in determ-\nining whether we will imitate another’s behavior comes from scientific\nresearch. An especially apt illustration can be found in a study done\nseveral years ago by Columbia University psychologists. The researchers\nplaced wallets on the ground in various locations around midtown\nManhattan to observe what would happen when they were found. The\nwallets all contained $2.00 in cash, a $26.30 check, and various inform-\nation providing the name and address of the wallet’s “owner.” In addi-\ntion to this material, the wallet also contained a letter that made it\nevident that the wallet had been lost not once, but twice. The letter was\nwritten to the wallet’s owner from a man who had found it earlier and\nwhose intention was to return it. The finder indicated in his letter that\nhe was happy to help and that the chance to be of service in this way\nhad made him feel good.\nIt was evident to anyone who found one of these wallets that this\nwell-intentioned individual had then lost the wallet himself on the way\nto the mailbox—the wallet was wrapped in an envelope addressed to\nthe owner. The researchers wanted to know how many people finding\nsuch a wallet would follow the lead of the first finder and mail it, intact,\nto the original owner. Before they dropped the wallets, however, the\nresearchers varied one feature of the letter it contained. Some of the\nletters were written in standard English by what seemed to be an aver-Robert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 107\nage American, while the other letters were written in broken English\nby the first finder, who identified himself as a recently arrived foreigner.\nIn other words, the person who had initially found the wallet and had\ntried to return it was depicted by the letter as being either similar or\ndissimilar to most Americans.\nThe interesting question was whether the Manhattanites who found\nthe wallet and letter would be more influenced to mail the wallet if the\nfirst man who had tried to do so was similar to them. The answer was\nplain: Only 33 percent of the wallets were returned when the first\nfinder was seen as dissimilar, but fully 70 percent were returned when\nhe was thought to be a similar other. These results suggest an important\nqualification of the principle of social proof. We will use the actions of\nothers to decide on proper behavior for ourselves, especially when we\nview those others as similar to ourselves.\nThis tendency applies not only to adults but to children as well. Health\nresearchers have found, for example, that a school-based antismoking\nprogram had lasting effects only when it used same-age peer leaders\nas teachers. Another study found that children who saw a film depicting\na child’s positive visit to the dentist lowered their own dental anxieties\nprincipally when they were the same age as the child in the film. I wish\nI had known about this second study when, a few years before it was\npublished, I was trying to reduce a different kind of anxiety in my son,\nChris.\nI live in Arizona, where backyard swimming pools abound. One re-\ngrettable consequence is that every year several young children drown\nafter falling into an unattended pool. I was determined, therefore, to\nteach Chris how to swim at an early age. The problem was not that he\nwas afraid of the water. He loved it. But he would not get into the pool\nwithout wearing his inflatable plastic inner tube, no matter how I tried\nto coax, talk, or shame him out of it. After getting nowhere for two\nmonths, I hired some help: a graduate student of mine—a big, strapping\nformer lifeguard who had once worked as a swimming instructor. He\nfailed as totally as I had. He couldn’t persuade Chris to attempt even\na stroke outside of his plastic ring.\nAround this time, Chris was attending a day camp that provided a\nnumber of activities to its members, including use of a large pool, which\nhe scrupulously avoided. One day, shortly after the graduate student\nfiasco, I went to get Chris from camp a bit early and, with mouth agape,\nwatched him run down the diving board and jump into the middle of\nthe deepest part of the pool. Panicking, I began pulling off my shoes to\njump in to his rescue when I saw him bob to the surface and paddle\nsafely to the side of the pool—where I dashed, shoes in hand, to meet\nhim.108 / Influence\n“Chris, you can swim,” I said excitedly. “You can swim!”\n“Yes,” he responded casually, “I learned how today.”\n“This is terrific! This is just terrific,” I burbled, gesturing expansively\nto convey my enthusiasm. “But how come you didn’t need your plastic\nring today?”\nLooking somewhat embarrassed because his father seemed to be\nraving while inexplicably soaking his socks in a small puddle and\nwaving his shoes around, Chris explained: “Well, I’m three years old,\nand Tommy is three years old. And Tommy can swim without a ring,\nso that means I can too.”\nI could have kicked myself. Of course, it would be to little Tommy,\nnot to a six-foot-two-inch graduate student, that Chris would look for\nthe most relevant information about what he could or should do. Had\nI been more thoughtful about solving Chris’s swimming problem, I\ncould have employed Tommy’s good example earlier and, perhaps,\nhave saved myself a couple of frustrating months. I could have simply\nnoted at the day camp that Tommy was a swimmer and then arranged\nwith his parents for the boys to spend a weekend afternoon swimming\nin our pool. My guess is that Chris’s plastic ring would have been\nabandoned by the end of the day.11\nAny factor that can spur 70 percent of New Yorkers to return a wallet\n(or can reduce the likelihood that kids will take up smoking or will fear\na dentist visit) must be considered impressive. Yet research findings of\nthis sort offer just a hint of the immense impact that the conduct of\nsimilar others has on human behavior. Other, more powerful examples\nexist. To my mind, the most telling illustration of this impact starts with\na seemingly nonsensical statistic: After a suicide has made front-page\nnews, airplanes—private planes, corporate jets, airliners—begin falling\nout of the sky at an alarming rate.\nFor example, it has been shown that immediately following certain\nkinds of highly publicized suicide stories, the number of people who\ndie in commercial-airline crashes increases by 1,000 percent! Even more\nalarming: The increase is not limited to airplane deaths. The number\nof automobile fatalities shoots up as well.12 What could possibly be\nresponsible?\nOne explanation suggests itself immediately: The same social condi-\ntions that cause some people to commit suicide cause others to die acci-\ndentally. For instance, certain individuals, the suicide-prone, may react\nto stressful societal events (economic downturns, rising crime rates,\ninternational tensions) by ending it all. But others will react differently\nto these same events; they might become angry or impatient or nervous\nor distracted. To the degree that such people operate (or service) theRobert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 109\ncars and planes of our society, the vehicles will be less safe, and, con-\nsequently, we will see a sharp increase in the number of automobile\nand air fatalities.\nAccording to this “social conditions” interpretation, then, some of\nthe same societal factors that cause intentional deaths also cause acci-\ndental ones, and that is why we find so strong a connection between\nsuicide stories and fatal crashes. But another fascinating statistic indic-\nates that this is not the correct explanation: Fatal crashes increase dra-\nmatically only in those regions where the suicide has been highly pub-\nlicized. Other places, existing under similar social conditions, whose\nnewspapers have not publicized the story, have shown no comparable\njump in such fatalities. Furthermore, within those areas where newspa-\nper space has been allotted, the wider the publicity given the suicide,\nthe greater has been the rise in subsequent crashes. Thus it is not some\nset of common societal events that stimulates suicides on the one hand,\nand fatal accidents on the other. Instead it is the publicized suicide story\nitself that produces the car and plane wrecks.\nTo explain the strong association between suicide-story publicity and\nsubsequent crashes, a “bereavement” account has been suggested. Be-\ncause, it has been argued, front-page suicides often in-volve well-known\nand respected public figures, perhaps their highly publicized deaths\nthrow many people into states of shocked sadness. Stunned and preoc-\ncupied, these individuals become careless around cars and planes. The\nconsequence is the sharp increase in deadly accidents involving such\nvehicles that we see after front-page suicide stories. Although the be-\nreavement theory can account for the connection between the degree\nof publicity given a story and subsequent crash fatalities—the more\npeople who learn of the suicide, the larger number of bereaved and\ncareless individuals there will be—it cannot explain yet another startling\nfact: Newspaper stories reporting on suicide victims who died alone\nproduce an increase in the frequency of single-fatality wrecks only,\nwhereas stories reporting on suicide-plus-murder incidents produce\nan increase in multiple-fatality wrecks only. Simple bereavement could\nnot cause such a pattern.\nThe influence of suicide stories on car and plane crashes, then, is\nfantastically specific. Stories of pure suicides, in which only one person\ndies, generate wrecks in which only one person dies; stories of suicide-\nmurder combinations, in which there are multiple deaths, generate\nwrecks in which there are multiple deaths. If neither “social conditions”\nnor “bereavement” account for this bewildering array of facts, what\ncan? There is a sociologist at the University of California at San Diego\nwho thinks he has found the answer. His name is David Phillips, and\nhe points a convincing finger at something called the “Werther effect.”110 / Influence\nThe story of the Werther effect is both chilling and intriguing. More\nthan two centuries ago, the great man of German literature, Johann von\nGoethe, published a novel entitled Die Leiden des jungen Werthers (The\nSorrows of Young Werther). The book, in which the hero, named Werther,\ncommits suicide, had a remarkable impact. Not only did it provide\nGoethe with immediate fame, but it also sparked a wave of emulative\nsuicides across Europe. So powerful was this effect that authorities in\nseveral countries banned the novel.\nProfessor Phillips’s own work has traced the Werther effect to modern\ntimes. His research has demonstrated that immediately following a\nfront-page suicide story the suicide rate increases dra-matically in those\ngeographical areas where the story has been highly publicized. It is\nPhillips’s argument that certain troubled people who read of another’s\nself-inflicted death kill themselves in imitation. In a morbid illustration\nof the principle of social proof, these people decide how they should\nact on the basis of how some other troubled person has acted.\nPhillips got his evidence for the modern-day Werther effect by ex-\namining the suicide statistics in the United States between 1947 and\n1968. He found that within two months after every front-page suicide\nstory, an average of fifty-eight more people than usual killed themselves.\nIn a sense, each suicide story killed fifty-eight people who otherwise\nwould have gone on living. Phillips also found that this tendency for\nsuicides to beget suicides occurred principally in those parts of the\ncountry where the first suicide was highly publicized and that the wider\nthe publicity given the first suicide, the greater the number of later\nsuicides.\nIf the facts surrounding the Werther effect seem to you suspiciously\nlike those surrounding the influence of suicide stories on air and traffic\nfatalities, the similarities have not been lost on Professor Phillips either.\nIn fact, he contends that all the excess deaths following a front-page\nsuicide incident can be explained as the same thing: copycat suicides.\nUpon learning of another’s suicide, an uncomfortably large number of\npeople decide that suicide is an appropriate action for themselves as\nwell. Some of these individuals then proceed to commit the act in a\nstraightforward, no-bones-about-it fashion, causing the suicide rate to\njump.\nOthers, however, are less direct. For any of several reasons—to protect\ntheir reputations, to spare their families the shame and hurt, to allow\ntheir dependents to collect on insurance policies—they do not want to\nappear to have killed themselves. They would rather seem to have died\naccidentally. So, purposively but furtively, they cause the wreck of a\ncar or a plane they are operating or are simply riding in. This could be\naccomplished in a variety of all-too-familiar-sounding ways. A commer-Robert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 111\ncial-airline pilot could dip the nose of the aircraft at a crucial point of\ntakeoff or could inexplicably land on an already occupied runway\nagainst instructions from the control tower; the driver of a car could\nsuddenly swerve into a tree or into oncoming traffic; a passenger in an\nautomobile or corporate jet could incapacitate the operator, causing a\ndeadly crash; the pilot of a private plane could, despite all radio warn-\nings, plow into another aircraft. Thus the alarming climb in crash\nfatalities we find following front-page suicides is, according to Dr.\nPhillips, most likely due to the Werther effect secretly applied.\nI consider this insight brilliant. First, it explains all of the data beauti-\nfully. If these wrecks really are hidden instances of imitative suicide, it\nmakes sense that we should see an increase in the wrecks after suicide\nstories appear. And it makes sense that the greatest rise in wrecks should\noccur after the suicide stories that have been most widely publicized\nand have, consequently, reached the most people. And it makes sense\nthat the number of crashes should jump appreciably only in those\ngeographical areas where the suicide stories were publicized. And it\neven makes sense that single-victim suicides should lead only to single-\nvictim crashes, whereas multiple-victim suicide incidents should lead\nonly to multiple-victim crashes. Imitation is the key.\nBut there is a second valuable feature of Phillips’s insight. Not only\ndoes it allow us to explain the existing facts, it also allows us to predict\nnew facts that had never been uncovered before. For example, if the\nabnormally frequent crashes following publicized suicides are genuinely\ndue to imitative rather than accidental actions, they should be more\ndeadly as a result. That is, people trying to kill themselves will likely\narrange (with a foot on the accelerator instead of the brake, with the\nnose of the plane down instead of up) for the impact to be as lethal as\npossible. The consequence should be quick and sure death. When\nPhillips examined the records to check on this prediction, he found that\nthe average number of people killed in a fatal crash of a commercial\nairliner is more than three times greater if the crash happened one week\nafter a front-page suicide story than if it happened one week before. A\nsimilar phenomenon can be found in traffic statistics, where there is\nevidence for the deadly efficiency of postsuicide-story auto crashes.\nVictims of fatal car wrecks that follow front-page suicide stories die\nfour times more quickly than normal.\nStill another fascinating prediction flows from Phillips’s idea. If the\nincrease in wrecks following suicide stories truly represents a set of\ncopycat deaths, then the imitators should be most likely to copy the\nsuicides of people who are similar to them. The principle of social proof\nstates that we use information about how others have behaved to help\nus determine proper conduct for ourselves. But as the dropped-wallet112 / Influence\nexperiment showed, we are most influenced in this fashion by the ac-\ntions of others like us.\nTherefore, Phillips reasoned, if the principle of social proof is behind\nthe phenomenon, there should be some clear similarity between the\nvictim of the highly publicized suicide and those who cause subsequent\nwrecks. Realizing that the clearest test of this possibility would come\nfrom the records of automobile crashes involving a single car and a lone\ndriver, Phillips compared the age of the suicide-story victim with the\nages of the lone drivers killed in single-car crashes immediately after\nthe story appeared in print. Once again the predictions were strikingly\naccurate: When the newspaper detailed the suicide of a young person,\nit was young drivers who then piled their cars into trees, poles, and\nembankments with fatal results; but when the news story concerned\nan older person’s suicide, older drivers died in such crashes.\nThis last statistic is the crusher for me. I am left wholly convinced\nand, simultaneously, wholly amazed by it. Evidently, the principle of\nsocial proof is so wide-ranging and powerful that its domain extends\nto the fundamental decision for life or death. Professor Phillips’s findings\nhave persuaded me of a distressing tendency for suicide publicity to\nmotivate certain people who are similar to the victim to kill them-\nselves—because they now find the idea of suicide more legitimate.\nTruly frightening are the data indicating that many innocent people\ndie in the bargain. A glance at the graphs documenting the undeniable\nincrease in traffic and air fatalities following publicized suicides, espe-\ncially those involving murder, is enough to cause concern for one’s own\nsafety. I have been sufficiently affected by these statistics to begin to\ntake note of front-page suicide stories and to change my behavior in\nthe period after their appearance. I try to be especially cautious behind\nthe wheel of my car. I am reluctant to take extended trips requiring a\nlot of air travel. If I must fly during such a period, I purchase substan-\ntially more flight insurance than I normally would. Dr. Phillips has\ndone us a service by demonstrating that the odds for survival when we\ntravel change measurably for a time following the publication of certain\nkinds of front-page suicide stories. It would seem only prudent to play\nthose odds.\nAs if the frightening features of Phillips’s suicide data weren’t enough,\nhis subsequent research brings more cause for alarm: Homicides in this\ncountry have a stimulated, copycat character after highly publicized\nacts of violence. Heavyweight championship prize fights that receive\ncoverage on network evening news appear to produce measurable in-\ncreases in the U.S. homicide rate. This analysis of heavyweight champi-\nonship fights (between 1973 and 1978) is perhaps most compelling in\nits demonstration of the remarkably specific nature of the imitativeRobert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 113\naggression that is generated. When such a match was lost by a black\nfighter, the homicide rate during the following ten days rose signific-\nantly for young black male victims but not young white males. On the\nother hand, when a white fighter lost a match, it was young white men\nbut not young black men who were killed more frequently in the next\nten days.14 When these results are combined with the parallel findings\nin Phillips’s suicide data, it is clear that widely publicized aggression\nhas the nasty tendency to spread to similar victims, no matter whether\nthe aggression is inflicted on the self or on another.\nWork like Dr. Phillips’s helps us appreciate the awesome influence\nof the behavior of similar others. Once the enormity of that force is re-\ncognized, it becomes possible to understand perhaps the most spectac-\nular act of compliance of our time—the mass suicide at Jonestown,\nGuyana. Certain crucial features of that event deserve review.\nThe People’s Temple was a cultlike organization that began in San\nFrancisco and drew its recruits from the poor of that city. In 1977, the\nReverend Jim Jones—who was the group’s undisputed political, social,\nand spiritual leader—moved the bulk of the membership with him to\na jungle settlement in Guyana, South America. There, the People’s\nTemple existed in relative obscurity until November 18, 1978, when\nfour men of a fact-finding party led by Congressman Leo J. Ryan were\nmurdered as they tried to leave Jonestown by plane. Convinced that\nhe would be arrested and implicated in the killings and that the demise\nof the People’s Temple would result, Jones sought to control the end\nof the Temple in his own way. He gathered the entire community\naround him and issued a call for each person’s death in a unified act of\nself-destruction.\nThe first response was that of a young woman who calmly ap-\nproached the now famous vat of strawberry-flavored poison, admin-\nistered one dose to her baby, one to herself, and then sat down in a\nfield, where she and her child died in convulsions within four minutes.\nOthers followed steadily in turn. Although a handful of Jonestowners\nescaped rather than comply and a few others are reported to have res-\nisted, the survivors claim that the great majority of the 910 people who\ndied did so in an orderly, willful fashion.\nNews of the event shocked us. The broadcast media and the papers\nprovided a barrage of reports, updates, and analyses. For days, our\nconversations were full of the topic: “How many have they found dead\nnow?” “A guy who escaped says they were drinking the poison like\nthey were hypnotized or something.” “What were they doing down in\nSouth America, anyway?” “It’s so hard to believe. What caused it?”\nYes, “What caused it?”—the critical question. How are we to account114 / Influence\nfor this most astounding of compliant acts? Various explanations have\nbeen offered. Some have focused on the charisma of Jim Jones, a man\nwhose style allowed him to be loved like a savior, trusted like a father,\nand treated like an emperor. Other explanations have pointed to the\nkind of people who were attracted to the People’s Temple. They were\nmostly poor and uneducated individuals who were willing to give up\ntheir freedoms of thought and action for the safety of a place where all\ndecisions would be made for them. Still other explanations have em-\nphasized the quasi-religious nature of the People’s Temple, in which\nunquestioned faith in the cult’s leader was assigned highest priority.\nNo doubt each of these features of Jonestown has merit in explaining\nwhat happened there. But I do not find them sufficient. After all, the\nworld abounds with cults populated by dependent people who are led\nby a charismatic figure. What’s more, there has never been a shortage\nof this combination of circumstances in the past. Yet virtually nowhere\ndo we find evidence of an event even approximating the Jonestown\nincident among such groups. There must be something else that was\ncritical.\nOne especially revealing question gives us a clue: “If the community\nhad remained in San Francisco, would Rev. Jim Jones’s suicide command\nhave been obeyed?” A highly speculative question to be sure, but the\nexpert most familiar with the People’s Temple has no doubt about the\nanswer. Dr. Louis Jolyon West, chairman of psychiatry and biobehavi-\noral sciences at UCLA and director of its neuropsychiatric unit, is an\nauthority on cults who had observed the People’s Temple for eight\nyears prior to the Jonestown deaths. When interviewed in the immediate\naftermath, he made what strikes me as an inordinately instructive\nstatement: “This wouldn’t have happened in California. But they lived\nin total alienation from the rest of the world in a jungle situation in a\nhostile country.”\nAlthough lost in the welter of commentary following the tragedy,\nDr. West’s observation, together with what we know about the principle\nof social proof, seems to me quite important to a satisfactory understand-\ning of the compliant suicides. To my mind, the single act in the history\nof the People’s Temple that most contrib-uted to the members’ mindless\ncompliance that day occurred a year earlier with the relocation of the\nTemple to a jungled country of unfamiliar customs and strange people.\nIf we are to believe the stories of Jim Jones’s malevolent genius, he\nrealized fully the massive psychological impact such a move would\nhave on his followers. All at once, they found themselves in a place\nthey knew nothing about. South America, and the rain forests of Guyana,\nespecially, were unlike anything they had experienced in San Francisco.Robert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 115\nThe country—both physical and social—into which they were dropped\nmust have seemed dreadfully uncertain.\nAh, uncertainty—the right-hand man of the principle of social proof.\nWe have already seen that when people are uncertain, they look to the\nactions of others to guide their own actions. In the alien, Guyanese en-\nvironment, then, Temple members were very ready to follow the lead\nof others. But as we have also seen, it is others of a special kind whose\nbehavior will be most unquestioningly followed—similar others. And\ntherein lies the awful beauty of the Reverend Jim Jones’s relocation\nstrategy. In a country like Guyana, there were no similar others for a\nJonestown resident but the people of Jonestown itself.\nWhat was right for a member of the community was determined to\na disproportionate degree by what other community members—influ-\nenced heavily by Jones—did and believed. When viewed in this light,\nthe terrible orderliness, the lack of panic, the sense of calm with which\nthese people moved to the vat of poison and to their deaths, seems more\ncomprehensible. They hadn’t been hypnotized by Jones; they had been\nconvinced—partly by him but, more important, also by the principle\nof social proof—that suicide was correct conduct. The uncertainty they\nsurely felt upon first hearing the death command must have caused\nthem to look to those around them for a definition of the appropriate\nresponse. It is particularly worth noting that they found two impressive\npieces of social evidence, each pointing in the same direction.\nThe first was the initial set of their compatriots, who quickly and\nwillingly took the poison drafts. There will always be a few such fanat-\nically obedient individuals in any strong-leader-dominated group.\nWhether, in this instance, they had been specially instructed beforehand\nto serve as examples or whether they were just naturally the most\ncompliant with Jones’s wishes is difficult to know. No matter; the psy-\nchological effect of the actions of those individuals must have been\npotent. If the suicides of similar others in news stories can influence\ntotal strangers to kill themselves, imagine how enormously more com-\npelling such an act would be when performed without hesitation by\none’s neighbors in a place like Jonestown.\nThe second source of social evidence came from the reactions of the\ncrowd itself. Given the conditions, I suspect that what occurred was a\nlarge-scale instance of the pluralistic ignorance phenomenon that fre-\nquently infects onlookers at emergencies. Each Jonestowner looked to\nthe actions of surrounding individuals to assess the situation\nand—finding seeming calm because everyone else, too, was surrepti-\ntiously assessing rather than reacting—“learned” that patient turn taking\nwas the correct behavior. Such misinterpreted but nonetheless convin-\ncing social evidence would be expected to result precisely in the ghastly116 / Influence\ncomposure of the assemblage that waited in the tropics of Guyana for\nbusinesslike death.\nFrom my own perspective, most attempts to analyze the Jonestown\nincident have focused too much on the personal qualities of Jim Jones.\nAlthough he was without question a man of rare dynamism, the power\nhe wielded strikes me as coming less from his remarkable personal style\nthan from his understanding of fundamental psychological principles.\nHis real genius as a leader was his realization of the limitations of indi-\nvidual leadership. No leader can hope to persuade, regularly and single-\nhandedly, all the members of the group. A forceful leader can reasonably\nexpect, however, to persuade some sizable proportion of group mem-\nbers. Then the raw information that a substantial number of group\nmembers has been convinced can, by itself, convince the rest. Thus the\nmost influential leaders are those who know how to arrange group\nconditions to allow the principle of social proof to work maximally in\ntheir favor.\nIt is in this that Jones appears to have been inspired. His masterstroke\nwas the decision to move the People’s Temple community from its roots\nin urban San Francisco to the remoteness of equatorial South America,\nwhere the conditions of uncertainty and exclusive similarity would\nmake the principle of social proof operate for him as perhaps nowhere\nelse. There, a settlement of a thousand people, much too large to be\nheld in persistent sway by the force of one man’s personality, could be\nchanged from a following into a herd. As slaughterhouse operators have\nlong known, the mentality of a herd makes it easy to manage. Simply\nget some members moving in the desired direction and the others—re-\nsponding not so much to the lead animal as to those immediately sur-\nrounding them—will peacefully and mechanically go along. The powers\nof the amazing Reverend Jim Jones, then, are probably best understood\nnot in terms of his dramatic personal style, but in his profound know-\nledge of the art of social jujitsu.\nHOW TO SAY NO\nThis chapter began with an account of the relatively harmless practice\nof laugh tracking and has moved on to stories of murder and suicide—all\nexplained by the principle of social proof. How can we expect to defend\nourselves against a weapon of influence that pervades such a vast range\nof behavior? The difficulty is compounded by the realization that most\nof the time, we don’t want to guard against the information that social\nproof provides. The evidence it offers about how we should act is usu-\nally valid and valuable. With it we can cruise confidently through aRobert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 117\nmyriad of decisions without personally having to investigate the detailed\npros and cons of each.\nIn this sense, the principle of social proof equips us with a wonderful\nkind of automatic-pilot device not unlike that aboard most aircraft.\nYet there are occasional but real problems with automatic pilots.\nThose problems appear whenever the flight information locked into\nthe control mechanism is wrong. In these instances, we will be taken\noff course. Depending on the size of the error, the consequences can be\nsevere. But, because the automatic pilot afforded by the principle of\nsocial proof is more often an ally than an enemy, we can’t be expected\nto want simply to disconnect it. Thus we are faced with a classic prob-\nlem: how to make use of a piece of equipment that simultaneously be-\nnefits and imperils our welfare.\nFortunately, there is a way out of the dilemma. Because the disadvant-\nages of automatic pilots arise principally when incorrect data have been\nput into the control system, our best defense against these disadvantages\nis to recognize when the data are in error. If we can become sensitive\nto situations where the social-proof automatic pilot is working with\ninaccurate information, we can disengage the mechanism and grasp\nthe controls when we need to.\nThere are two types of situation in which incorrect data cause the\nprinciple of social proof to give us poor counsel. The first occurs when\nthe social evidence has been purposely falsified. Invariably these situ-\nations are manufactured by exploiters intent on creating the impres-\nsion—reality be damned—that a multitude is performing the way the\nexploiters want us to perform. The canned laughter of TV comedy\nshows, which we have already discussed, is one variety of faked data\nof this sort. But there is a great deal more; and much of the fakery is\nstrikingly obvious.\nFor instance, canned responses are not unique to the electronic media\nor even to the electronic age. In fact, the heavy-handed exploitation of\nthe principle of social proof can be traced through the history of one of\nour most venerable art forms: grand opera. This is the phenomenon\ncalled claquing, said to have been begun in 1820 by a pair of Paris opera-\nhouse habitués named Sauton and Porcher. The men were more than\noperagoers, though. They were businessmen whose product was ap-\nplause.\nOrganizing under the title L’Assurance des Succès Dramatiques, they\nleased themselves and their employees to singers and opera managers\nwho wished to be assured of an appreciative audience response. So ef-\nfective were they in stimulating genuine audience reaction with their\nrigged reactions that before long claques (usually consisting of a lead-118 / Influence\ner—chef de claque—and several individual claqueurs) had become an es-\ntablished and persistent tradition throughout the world of opera. As\nmusic historian Robert Sabin notes, “By 1830 the claque was a full-bloom\ninstitution, collecting by day, applauding by night, all in the honest\nopen…. But it is altogether probable that neither Sauton, nor his ally\nPorcher, had a notion of the extent to which their scheme of paid ap-\nplause would be adopted and applied wherever opera is sung.”15\nAs claquing grew and developed, its practitioners offered an array\nof styles and strengths. In the same way that laugh-track producers can\nhire individuals who excel in titters, chuckles, or belly laughs, the\nclaques spawned their own specialists—the pleureuse, chosen for her\nability to weep on cue; the bisseur, who called “bis” (repeat) and “encore”\nin ecstatic tones; and in direct kinship with today’s laugh-track per-\nformer, the rieur, selected for the infectious quality of his laugh.\nFor our purposes, though, the most instructive parallel to modern\nforms of canned response is the conspicuous character of the fakery.\nNo special need was seen to disguise or vary the claque, who often sat\nin the same seats, performance after performance, year after year, led\nby a chef de claque two decades into his position. Even the monetary\ntransactions were not hidden from the public. Indeed, one hundred\nyears after the birth of claquing, a reader of the London Musical Times\ncould scan the advertised rates of the Italian claqueurs. Whether in the\nworld of Rigoletto or Gilligan’s Island, then, audiences have been success-\nfully manipulated by those who use social evidence, even when that\nevidence has been openly falsified.\nFor applause on entrance, if a gentleman 25 lire\nFor applause on entrance, if a lady 15 lire\nOrdinary applause during performance, each 10 lire\nInsistent applause during performance, each 15 lire\nStill more insistent applause 17 lire\nFor interruptions with “Bene!” or “Bravo!” 5 lire\nFor a “Bis” at any cost 50 lire\nWild enthusiasm—A special sum to be arranged\nFIGURE 4-5\nAdvertised Rates of the Italian Claque\nFrom “ordinary applause” to “wild enthusiasm,” claqueurs offered\ntheir services in an audaciously public fashion—in this case, in aRobert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 119\nnewspaper read by many of the audience members they fully expected\nto influence. Claque, whirr.\nWhat Sauton and Porcher realized about the mechanical way that\nwe abide by the principle of social proof is understood as well by a\nvariety of today’s exploiters. They see no need to hide the manufactured\nnature of the social evidence they provide—witness the amateurish\nquality of the average TV laugh track. They seem almost smug in the\nrecognition of our predicament: Either we must allow them to fool us\nor we must abandon the precious automatic pilots that make us so\nvulnerable to their tricks. But in their certainty that they have us trapped,\nsuch exploiters have made a crucial mistake. The laxity with which they\nconstruct phony social evidence gives us a way to fight back.\nBecause automatic pilots can be engaged and disengaged at will, we\ncan cruise along trusting in the course steered by the principle of social\nproof until we recognize that a piece of inaccurate data is being used.\nThen we can take the controls, make the necessary correction for the\nmisinformation, and reset the automatic pilot. The transparency of the\nrigged social proof we get these days provides us with exactly the cue\nwe need for knowing when to perform this simple maneuver. With no\nmore cost than a bit of vigilance for plainly counterfeit social evidence,\nthen, we can protect ourselves nicely.\nLet’s take an example. A bit earlier, we noted the proliferation of av-\nerage-person-on-the-street ads, in which a number of ordinary people\nspeak glowingly of a product, often without knowing that their words\nare being recorded. As would be expected according to the principle\nof social proof, these testimonials from “average people like you and\nme” make for quite effective advertising campaigns. They have always\nincluded one relatively subtle kind of distortion: We hear only from\nthose who like the product; as a result, we get an understandably biased\npicture of the amount of social support for it. More recently, though, a\ncruder and more unethical sort of falsification has been introduced.\nCommercial producers often don’t bother to get genuine testimonials.\nThey merely hire actors to play the roles of average people testifying\nin an unrehearsed fashion to an interviewer. It is amazing how bald-\nfaced these “unrehearsed interview” commercials can be. The situations\nare obviously staged, the participants are clearly actors, and the dialogue\nis unmistakably prewritten.\nDave Barry\nKnight Ridder News Service\nRecently I was watching TV, and a commercial came on, and the an-\nnouncer, in a tone of voice usually reserved for major developments in120 / Influence\nthe Persian Gulf, said, “Now consumers can ask Angela Lansbury their\nquestions about Bufferin!”\nAs a normal human, the natural reaction to this announcement is:\n“Huh?” Meaning: “What does Angela Lansbury have to do with Buf-\nferin?” But this commercial featured several consumers who had appar-\nently been stopped at random on the street, and every one of them had a\nquestion for Angela Lansbury about Bufferin. Basically, what they asked\nwas, “Miss Lansbury, is Bufferin a good product that I should purchase,\nor what?”\nThese consumers seemed very earnest. It was as if they had been\ngoing around for months wringing their hands and saying, “I have a\nquestion about Bufferin!

Moreover, each manufacturer\nof the items should receive a letter explaining our response and recom-\nmending that they discontinue use of the advertising agency that pro-\nduced so deceptive a presentation of their product.\nOf course, we don’t always want to trust the actions of others to direct\nour conduct—especially in a situation important enough to warrant\nour personal investigation of the pros and cons, or in which we are ex-\nperts—but we do want to be able to count on others’ behavior as a\nsource of valid information in a large array of settings. If, in such set-\ntings, we find that we cannot trust the information to be valid because\nsomeone has tampered with the evidence, we ought to be ready to strike\nback. In such instances, I personally feel driven by more than the aver-\nsion to being duped. I bristle at the thought of being pushed into an\nunacceptable corner by those who would undermine one of my hedges\nagainst the decisional overload of modern life. And I get a genuine\nsense of righteousness by lashing out when they try. If you are like me,\nso should you.\nIn addition to the times when social evidence is deliberately faked,\nthere is another time when the principle of social proof will regularly\nsteer us wrong. In such an instance, an innocent, natural error will\nproduce snowballing social proof that pushes us to the incorrect de-\ncision. The pluralist ignorance phenomenon, in which everyone at an\nemergency sees no cause for alarm, is one example of this process. The\nbest illustration I know, however, comes from a story of one of my\nstudents, who was a highway patrolman.\nAfter a class session in which the subject of discussion was the prin-\nciple of social proof, he stayed to talk with me. He said that he now\nunderstood the cause of a type of traffic accident that had always\npuzzled him before. The accident typically occurred on the city freeway\nduring rush hour, when cars in all lanes were moving steadily but\nslowly. Events leading to the accident would start when a pair of cars,\none behind the other, would simultaneously begin signaling an intention\nto get out of the lane they were in and into the next. Within seconds, a\nlong line of drivers to the rear of the first two would follow suit,\nthinking that something—a stalled car or a construction barrier—was\nblocking the lane ahead. It would be in this crush to cram into the\navailable spaces of the next lane that a collision frequently happened.\nThe odd thing about it all, according to the patrolman, was that very\noften there had been no obstruction to be avoided in the first place, and\nby the time of the accident, this should have been obvious to anyone\nwho looked. He said he had more than once witnessed such accidents122 / Influence\nwhen there was a visibly clear road in front of the ill-fated lane\nswitchers.\nThe patrolman’s account provides certain insights into the way we\nrespond to social proof. First, we seem to assume that if a lot of people\nare doing the same thing, they must know something we don’t. Espe-\ncially when we are uncertain, we are willing to place an enormous\namount of trust in the collective knowledge of the crowd. Second, quite\nfrequently the crowd is mistaken because they are not acting on the\nbasis of any superior information but are reacting, themselves, to the\nprinciple of social proof.\nSo if a pair of freeway drivers decided by coincidence to change lanes\nat the identical moment, the next two drivers might well do the same,\nassuming that the forward drivers had spotted an obstruction. The\nresulting social evidence confronting drivers behind this group would\nbe potent—four successive cars, all with their turn signals flashing,\ntrying to angle into the next lane. More signal lights would go on. The\nsocial proof would be undeniable by then. For drivers to the rear, there\ncould be no question about the correctness of switching lanes: “All those\nguys ahead must know something.” So intent would they be upon\nworking themselves into the next lane that, without even checking the\ntrue condition of the road before them, the drivers would begin a line-\nlong flank assault. Crash.\nThere is a lesson here: An automatic-pilot device, like social proof,\nshould never be trusted fully; even when no saboteur has fed bad in-\nformation into the mechanism, it can sometimes go haywire by itself.\nWe need to check the machine from time to time to be sure that it hasn’t\nworked itself out of sync with the other sources of evidence in the\nsituation—the objective facts, our prior experiences, our own judgments.\nFortunately, this precaution requires neither much effort nor much\ntime. A quick glance around is all that is needed. And this little precau-\ntion is well worth it. The consequences of single-minded reliance on\nsocial evidence can be frightening.\nThis aspect of the social proof phenomenon always reminds me of\nthe way certain Indian tribes—the Blackfeet, Cree, Snake, and\nCrow—used to hunt the North American buffalo. There are two features\nof buffalo that make them especially susceptible to erroneous social\nevidence. First, their eyes are set in their heads so that it is easier for\nthem to see to the side than to the front. Second, when they run, as in\na stampede, it is with their heads down low so they cannot see above\nthe herd. As a result, the Indians realized, it was possible to kill tremend-\nous numbers of buffalo by starting a herd running toward a cliff. The\nanimals, responding to the thundering social proof around them—and\nnever looking up to see what lay ahead—did the rest. One astonishedRobert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 123\nobserver to such a hunt described the deadly outcome of the buffalo’s\nobsessive trust in collective knowledge.\nIn this way, it was possible to decoy a herd toward a precipice, and\ncause it to plunge over en masse, the leaders being thrust over by\ntheir followers and all the rest following of their own free will.16\nCertainly, a flier whose plane is locked onto automatic pilot would\nbe wise to glance occasionally at the instrument panel and out the\nwindow. In the same way, we need to look up and around periodically\nwhenever we are locked onto the evidence of the crowd. Without this\nsimple safeguard against misguided social proof, our prospects might\nwell run parallel to those of the freeway lane switchers and the North\nAmerican buffalo: Crash.\nREADER’S REPORT\nFrom a Former Racetrack Employee\n“I became aware of one method of faking social evidence to one’s ad-\nvantage while working at a racetrack. In order to lower the odds and\nmake more money, some bettors are able to sway the public to bet on\nbad horses.\n“Odds at a racetrack are based on where the money is being bet. The\nmore money on a horse, the lower (better) the odds. Many people who\nplay the horses have surprisingly little knowledge of racing or betting\nstrategy. Thus, especially when they don’t know much about the horses\nin a particular race, a lot of times they’ll simply bet the favorite. Because\ntote boards are displayed with up-to-the-minute odds, the public can\nalways tell who the current favorite is. The system that a high roller\ncan use to alter the odds is actually quite simple. The guy has in mind\na horse he feels has a good chance of winning. Next he chooses a horse\nthat has long odds (say, 15 to 1) and doesn’t have a realistic chance to\nwin. The minute the mutual windows open, the guy puts down a\nhundred dollars on the inferior horse, creating an instant favorite whose\nodds on the board drop to about 2 to 1.\n“Now the elements of social proof begin to work. People who are\nuncertain of how to bet the race look to the tote board to see which\nhorse the early bettors have decided is a favorite, and they follow. A\nsnowballing effect now occurs as other people continue to bet the favor-\nite. At this point, the high roller can go back to the window and bet\nheavily on his true favorite, which will have better odds now because\nthe ‘new favorite’ has pushed down the board. If the guy wins, the initial\nhundred-dollar investment will have been worth it many times over.\n“I’ve seen this happen myself. I remember one time a person put124 / Influence\ndown a hundred dollars on a prerace 10-to-1 shot, making it the early\nfavorite. The rumors started circulating around the track—people knew\nsomething. Next thing you know, everyone (me included) was betting\non this horse. It ended up running last and had a bad leg. Many people\nlost a lot of money. Somebody came out ahead though. We’ll never\nknow who. But he is the one with all the money. He understood the\ntheory of social proof.”\nOnce again we can see that social proof is most powerful for those who\nfeel unfamiliar or unsure in a specific situation and who, consequently,\nmust look outside of themselves for evidence of how best to behave\nthere.Robert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 125\nChapter 5\nLIKING\nThe Friendly Thief\nThe main work of a trial attorney is to make a jury like his\nclient.\n—CLARENCE DARROW\nFEW PEOPLE WOULD BE SURPRISED TO LEARN THAT, AS A RULE, we most\nprefer to say yes to the requests of someone we know and like. What\nmight be startling to note, however, is that this simple rule is used in\nhundreds of ways by total strangers to get us to comply with their re-\nquests.\nThe clearest illustration I know of the professional exploitation of the\nliking rule is the Tupperware party, which I consider the quintessential\nAmerican compliance setting. Anybody familiar with the workings of\na Tupperware party will recognize the use of the various weapons of\ninfluence we have examined so far: reciprocity (to start, games are\nplayed and prizes won by the partygoers; anyone who doesn’t win a\nprize gets to reach into a grab bag for hers so that everyone has received\na gift before the buying begins), commitment (each participant is urged\nto describe publicly the uses and benefits she has found in the Tupper-\nware she already owns), and social proof (once the buying begins, each\npurchase builds the idea that other, similar people want the product;\ntherefore, it must be good).\nAll the major weapons of influence are present to help things along,\nbut the real power of the Tupperware party comes from a particular\narrangement that trades on the liking rule. Despite the entertaining and\npersuasive salesmanship of the Tupperware demonstrator, the true re-\nquest to purchase the product does not come from this stranger; it comes\nfrom a friend to every woman in the room. Oh, the Tupperware repres-\nentative may physically ask for each partygoer’s order, all right, but\nthe more psychologically compelling requester is a housewife sitting\noff to the side, smiling, chatting, and serving refreshments. She is the\nparty hostess, who has called her friends together for the demonstration\nin her home and who, everyone knows, makes a profit from each piece\nsold at her party.\nSimple. By providing the hostess with a percentage of the take, the\nTupperware Home Parties Corporation arranges for its customers to\nbuy from and for a friend rather than an unknown salesperson. In this\nway, the attraction, the warmth, the security, and the obligation of\nfriendship are brought to bear on the sales setting. Consumer researchers\nFrenzer and Davis, who have examined the social ties between the\nhostess and the partygoers in home-party sales settings, have affirmed\nthe power of the company’s approach: The strength of that social bond\nis twice as likely to determine product purchase as is preference for the\nproduct itself. The results have been remarkable. It was recently estim-\nated that Tupperware sales exceed $2.5 million a day!\nWhat is interesting is that the customers appear to be fully aware of\nthe liking and friendship pressures embodied in the Tupperware party.\nSome don’t seem to mind; others do, but don’t seem to know how to\navoid them. One woman I spoke with described her reactions with\nmore than a bit of frustration in her voice:\nIt’s gotten to the point now where I hate to be invited to Tupper-\nware parties. I’ve got all the containers I need; and if I wanted any\nmore, I could buy another brand cheaper in the store. But when\na friend calls up, I feel like I have to go. And when I get there, I\nfeel like I have to buy something. What can I do? It’s for one of\nmy friends.\nWith so irresistible an ally as the friendship principle operating, it is\nlittle wonder that the company has abandoned retail sales outlets and\nhas pushed the home party concept until a Tupperware party now\nstarts somewhere every 2.7 seconds. But, of course, all sorts of other\ncompliance professionals recognize the pressure to say yes to someone\nwe know and like. Take, for instance, the growing number of charity\norganizations that recruit volunteers to canvass for donations close to\ntheir own homes. They understand perfectly how much more difficult\nit is for us to turn down a charity request when it comes from a friend\nor a neighbor.\nOther compliance professionals have found that the friend doesn’t\neven have to be present to be effective; often, just the mention of theRobert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 127\nfriend’s name is enough. The Shaklee Corporation, which specializes\nin door-to-door sales of various home-related products, advises its\nsalespeople to use the “endless chain” method for finding new custom-\ners. Once a customer admits to liking a product, he or she can be pressed\nfor the names of friends who would also appreciate learning about it.\nThe individuals on that list can then be approached for sales and a list\nof their friends, who can serve as sources for still other potential cus-\ntomers, and so on in an endless chain.\nThe key to the success of this method is that each new prospect is\nvisited by a salesperson armed with the name of a friend “who sugges-\nted I call on you.” Turning the salesperson away under those circum-\nstances is difficult; it’s almost like rejecting the friend. The Shaklee sales\nmanual insists that employees use this system without fail: “It would\nbe impossible to overestimate its value. Phoning or calling on a prospect\nand being able to say that Mr. So-and-so, a friend of his, felt he would\nbenefit by giving you a few moments of his time is virtually as good as\na sale 50 percent made before you enter.”\nThe widespread use by compliance practitioners of the liking bond\nbetween friends tells us much about the power of the liking rule to\nproduce assent. In fact, we find that such professionals seek to benefit\nfrom the rule even when already formed friendships are not present\nfor them to employ. Under these circumstances, the professionals’\ncompliance strategy is quite direct: They first get us to like them.\nThere is a man in Detroit, Joe Girard, who specialized in using the\nliking rule to sell Chevrolets. He became wealthy in the process, making\nmore than two hundred thousand dollars a year. With such a salary,\nwe might guess that he was a high-level GM executive or perhaps the\nowner of a Chevrolet dealership. But no. He made his money as a\nsalesman on the showroom floor. At what he did, he was phenomenal.\nFor twelve years straight, he won the title as the “number one car\nsalesman”; he averaged more than five cars and trucks sold every day\nhe worked; and he has been called the world’s “greatest car salesman”\nby the Guinness Book of World Records.\nFor all his success, the formula he employed was surprisingly simple.\nIt consisted of offering people just two things: a fair price and someone\nthey liked to buy from. “And that’s it,” he claimed in an interview.\n“Finding the salesman they like, plus the price; put them both together,\nand you get a deal.”\nFine. The Joe Girard formula tells us how vital the liking rule is to\nhis business, but it doesn’t tell us nearly enough. For one thing, it doesn’t\ntell us why customers liked him more than some other salesperson who\noffered a fair price. There is a crucial—and fascinating—general question128 / Influence\nthat Joe’s formula leaves unanswered: What are the factors that cause\none person to like another person? If we knew that answer, we would\nbe a long way toward understanding how people such as Joe can so\nsuccessfully arrange to have us like them and, conversely, how we\nmight successfully arrange to have others like us. Fortunately, social\nscientists have been asking the question for decades. Their accumulated\nevidence has allowed them to identify a number of factors that reliably\ncause liking. And, as we will see, each is cleverly used by compliance\nprofessionals to urge us along the road to “yes.”\nPhysical Attractiveness\nAlthough it is generally acknowledged that good-looking people have\nan advantage in social interaction, recent findings indicate that we may\nhave sorely underestimated the size and reach of that advantage. There\nseems to be a click, whirr response to attractive people. Like all click,\nwhirr reactions, it happens automatically, without forethought. The re-\nsponse itself falls into a category that social scientists call “halo effects.”\nA halo effect occurs when one positive characteristic of a person dom-\ninates the way that person is viewed by others. And the evidence is\nnow clear that physical attractiveness is often such a characteristic.\nResearch has shown that we automatically assign to good-looking\nindividuals such favorable traits as talent, kindness, honesty, and intel-\nligence. Furthermore, we make these judgments without being aware\nthat physical attractiveness plays a role in the process. Certain of the\nconsequences of this unconscious assumption that “good-looking equals\ngood” scare me. For example, a study of the Canadian federal elections\nfound that attractive candidates received more than two and a half\ntimes as many votes as unattractive candidates.1 Despite such evidence\nof favoritism toward handsome politicians, follow-up research demon-\nstrated that voters do not realize their bias. In fact, 73 percent of Cana-\ndian voters surveyed denied in the strongest possible terms that their\nvotes had been influenced by physical appearance; only 14 percent even\nallowed for the possibility of such influence. A similar effect has been\nfound in hiring situations. In one study, good grooming of applicants\nin a simulated employment interview accounted for more favorable\nhiring decisions than did job qualifications—this, even though the in-\nterviewers claimed that appearance played a small role in their choices.2\nEqually unsettling research indicates that our judicial process is\nsimilarly susceptible to the influences of body dimensions and bone\nstructure. Good-looking people are likely to receive highly favorable\ntreatment in the legal system. For example, in a Pennsylvania study,\nresearchers rated the physical attractiveness of seventy-four separateRobert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 129\nmale defendants at the start of their criminal trials. When, much later,\nthe researchers checked court records for the results of these cases, they\nfound that the handsome men had received significantly lighter sen-\ntences. In fact, the attractive defendants were twice as likely to avoid\njail as the unattractive ones.3 In another study—this one on the damages\nawarded in a staged negligence trial—a defendant who was better-\nlooking than his victim was assessed an average amount of $5,623; but\nwhen the victim was the more attractive of the two, the average com-\npensation was $10,051. What’s more, both male and female jurors ex-\nhibited the attractiveness-based favoritism.\nOther experiments have demonstrated that attractive people are more\nlikely to obtain help when in need and are more persuasive in changing\nthe opinions of an audience. Here, too, both sexes respond in the same\nway. In the helping study, for instance, the better-looking men and\nwomen received aid more often, even from members of their own sex.4\nA major exception to this rule might be expected to occur, of course, if\nthe attractive person is viewed as a direct competitor, especially a ro-\nmantic rival. Short of this qualification, though, it is apparent that good-\nlooking people enjoy an enormous social advantage in our culture. They\nare better liked, more persuasive, more frequently helped, and seen as\npossessing better personality traits and intellectual capacities. And it\nappears that the social benefits of good looks begin to accumulate quite\nearly. Research on elementary-school children shows that adults view\naggressive acts as less naughty when performed by an attractive child\nand that teachers presume good-looking children to be more intelligent\nthan their less-attractive classmates.5\nIt is hardly any wonder, then, that the halo of physical attractiveness\nis regularly exploited by compliance professionals. Because we like at-\ntractive people and because we tend to comply with those we like, it\nmakes sense that sales training programs include grooming hints, that\nfashionable clothiers select their floor staffs from among the good-\nlooking candidates, and that con men are handsome and con women\npretty.\nSimilarity\nBut what if physical appearance is not much at issue? After all, most\npeople possess average looks. Are there other factors that can be used\nto produce liking? As both researchers and compliance professionals\nknow, there are several, and one of the most influential is similarity.\nWe like people who are similar to us. This fact seems to hold true\nwhether the similarity is in the area of opinions, personality traits,\nbackground, or life-style. Consequently, those who wish to be liked in130 / Influence\norder to increase our compliance can accomplish that purpose by ap-\npearing similar to us in any of a wide variety of ways.\nDress is a good example. Several studies have demonstrated that we\nare more likely to help those who dress like us. In one study, done in\nthe early 1970s when young people tended to dress either in “hippie”\nor “straight” fashion, experimenters donned hippie or straight attire\nand asked college students on campus for a dime to make a phone call.\nWhen the experimenter was dressed in the same way as the student,\nthe request was granted in more than two thirds of the instances; but\nwhen the student and requester were dissimilarly dressed, the dime\nwas provided less than half the time. Another experiment shows how\nautomatic our positive response to similar others can be. Marchers in\nan antiwar demonstration were found to be not only more likely to sign\nthe petition of a similarly dressed requester, but also to do so without\nbothering to read it first. Click, whirr.6\nAnother way requesters can manipulate similarity to increase liking\nand compliance is to claim that they have backgrounds and interests\nsimilar to ours. Car salesmen, for example, are trained to look for\nevidence of such things while examining the customer’s trade-in. If\nthere is camping gear in the trunk, the salesman might mention, later\non, how he loves to get away from the city whenever he can; if there\nare golf balls on the back seat, he might remark that he hopes the rain\nwill hold off until he can play the eighteen holes he has scheduled for\nlater in the day; if he notices that the car was purchased out of state, he\nmight ask where the customer is from and report—with surprise—that\nhe (or his wife) was born there, too.\nAs trivial as these similarities may seem, they appear to work. One\nresearcher who examined the sales records of insurance companies\nfound that customers were more likely to buy insurance when the\nsalesperson was like them in such areas as age, religion, politics, and\ncigarette-smoking habits. Because even small similarities can be effective\nin producing a positive response to another and because a veneer of\nsimilarity can be so easily manufactured, I would advise special caution\nin the presence of requesters who claim to be “just like you.” Indeed,\nit would be wise these days to be careful around salespeople who just\nseem to be just like you. Many sales training programs now urge trainees\nto “mirror and match” the customer’s body posture, mood, and verbal\nstyle, as similarities along each of these dimensions have been shown\nto lead to positive results.7\nCompliments\nActor McLean Stevenson once described how his wife tricked him intoRobert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 131\nmarriage: “She said she liked me.” Although designed for a laugh, the\nremark is as much instructive as humorous. The information that\nsomeone fancies us can be a bewitchingly effective device for producing\nreturn liking and willing compliance. So, often in terms of flattery or\nsimple claims of affinity, we hear positive estimation from people who\nwant something from us.\nRemember Joe Girard, the world’s “greatest car salesman,” who says\nthe secret of his success was getting customers to like him? He did\nsomething that, on the face of it, seems foolish and costly. Each month\nhe sent every one of his more than thirteen thousand former customers\na holiday greeting card containing a personal message. The holiday\ngreeting changed from month to month (Happy New Year or Happy\nThanksgiving, etc.), but the message printed on the face of the card\nnever varied. It read, “I like you.” As Joe explained it, “There’s nothing\nelse on the card. Nothin’ but my name. I’m just telling ’em that I like\n’em.”\n“I like you.” It came in the mail every year, twelve times a year, like\nclockwork. “I like you,” on a printed card that went off to thirteen\nthousand other people, too. Could a statement of liking so impersonal,\nso obviously designed to sell cars, really work? Joe Girard thinks so;\nand a man as successful as he was at what he did deserves our attention.\nJoe understands an important fact about human nature: We are phe-\nnomenal suckers for flattery. Although there are limits to our gullibil-\nity—especially when we can be sure that the flatterer is trying to manip-\nulate us—we tend, as a rule, to believe praise and to like those who\nprovide it, oftentimes when it is clearly false.\nAn experiment done on men in North Carolina shows how helpless\nwe can be in the face of praise. The men in the study received comments\nabout themselves from another person who needed a favor from them.\nSome of the men got only positive comments, some got only negative\ncomments, and some got a mixture of good and bad. There were three\ninteresting findings. First, the evaluator who provided only praise was\nliked best by the men. Second, this was the case even though the men\nfully realized that the flatterer stood to gain from their liking him. Fi-\nnally, unlike the other types of comments, pure praise did not have to\nbe accurate to work. Positive comments produced just as much liking\nfor the flatterer when they were untrue as when they were true.8\nApparently we have such an automatically positive reaction to com-\npliments that we can fall victim to someone who uses them in an obvious\nattempt to win our favor. Click, whirr. When seen in this light, the ex-\npense of printing and mailing well over 150,000 “I like you” cards each\nyear seems neither as foolish nor as costly as before.132 / Influence\nContact and Cooperation\nFor the most part, we like things that are familiar to us.9 To prove the\npoint to yourself, try a little experiment. Get the negative of an old\nphotograph that shows a front view of your face and have it developed\ninto a pair of pictures—one that shows you as you actually look and\none that shows a reverse image (so that the right and left sides of your\nface are interchanged). Now decide which version of your face you like\nbetter and ask a good friend to make the choice, too. If you are at all\nlike a group of Milwaukee women on whom this procedure was tried,\nyou should notice something odd: Your friend will prefer the true print,\nbut you will prefer the reverse image. Why? Because you both will be\nresponding favorably to the more familiar face—your friend to the one\nthe world sees, and you to the transposed one you find in the mirror\nevery day.10\nBecause of its effect on liking, familiarity plays a role in decisions\nabout all sorts of things, including the politicians we elect. It appears\nthat in an election booth voters often choose a candidate merely because\nthe name seems familiar. In one controversial Ohio election a few years\nago, a man given little chance of winning the state attorney-general race\nswept to victory when, shortly before the election, he changed his name\nto Brown—a family name of much Ohio political tradition.11\nHow could such a thing happen? The answer lies partially in the\nunconscious way that familiarity affects liking. Often we don’t realize\nthat our attitude toward something has been influenced by the number\nof times we have been exposed to it in the past. For example, in one\nexperiment, the faces of several individuals were flashed on a screen\nso quickly that later on, the subjects who were exposed to the faces in\nthis manner couldn’t recall having seen any of them before. Yet, the\nmore frequently a person’s face was flashed on the screen, the more\nthese subjects came to like that person when they met in a subsequent\ninteraction. And because greater liking leads to greater social influence,\nthese subjects were also more persuaded by the opinion statements of\nthe individuals whose faces had appeared on the screen most fre-\nquently.12\nOn the basis of evidence that we are more favorable toward the things\nwe have had contact with, some people have recommended a “contact”\napproach to improving race relations. They argue that simply by\nproviding individuals of different ethnic background with more expos-\nure to one another as equals, those individuals will naturally come to\nlike each other better. However, when scientists have examined schoolRobert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 133\nintegration—the area offering the single best test of the contact ap-\nproach—they have discovered quite the opposite pattern. School deseg-\nregation is more likely to increase prejudice between blacks and whites\nthan to decrease it.13\nLet’s stay with the issue of school desegregation for a while. However\nwell intentioned the proponents of interracial harmony through simple\ncontact, their approach is unlikely to bear fruit because the argument\non which it is based is terribly misinformed. First of all, the school setting\nis no melting pot where children interact as readily with members of\nother ethnic groups as they do with their own. Years after formal school\nintegration, there is little social integration. The students clot together\nethnically, separating themselves for the most part from other groups.\nSecond, even if there were much more interethnic interaction, research\nshows that becoming familiar with something through repeated contact\ndoesn’t necessarily cause greater liking. In fact, continued exposure to\na person or object under unpleasant conditions such as frustration,\nconflict, or competition leads to less liking.14 And the typical American\nclassroom fosters precisely these unpleasant conditions.\nConsider the illuminating report of a psychologist, Elliot Aronson,\ncalled in to consult with school authorities on problems in the Austin,\nTexas, schools. His description of how he found education proceeding\nin the standard classroom could apply to nearly any public school in\nthe United States:\nIn general, here is how it works: The teacher stands in front of the\nclass and asks a question. Six to ten children strain in their seats\nand wave their hands in the teacher’s face, eager to be called on\nand show how smart they are. Several others sit quietly with eyes\naverted, trying to become invisible, When the teacher calls on one\nchild, you see looks of disappointment and dismay on the faces\nof the eager students, who missed a chance to get the teacher’s\napproval; and you will see relief on the faces of the others who\ndidn’t know the answer…. This game is fiercely competitive and\nthe stakes are high, because the kids are competing for the love\nand approval of one of the two or three most important people in\ntheir world.\nFurther, this teaching process guarantees that the children will\nnot learn to like and understand each other. Conjure up your own\nexperience. If you knew the right answer and the teacher called\non someone else, you probably hoped that he or she would make\na mistake so that you would have a chance to display your\nknowledge. If you were called on and failed, or if you didn’t even\nraise your hand to compete, you probably envied and resented134 / Influence\nyour classmates who knew the answer. Children who fail in this\nsystem become jealous and resentful of the successes, putting them\ndown as teacher’s pets or even resorting to violence against them\nin the school yard. The successful students, for their part, often\nhold the unsuccessful children in contempt, calling them “dumb”\nor “stupid.”\nThis competitive process does not encourage anyone to look\nbenevolently and happily upon his fellow students.15\nShould we wonder, then, why raw school desegregation—whether\nby enforced busing, district rezoning, or school closures—so frequently\nproduces increased rather than decreased prejudice? When our own\nchildren find their pleasant social and friendship contacts within their\nown ethnic boundaries and get repeated exposure to other groups only\nin the competitive cauldron of the classroom, we might expect as much.\nAre there available solutions to this problem? One possibility might\nbe to end our attempts at school integration. But that hardly seems\nworkable. Even were we to ignore the inevitable legal and constitutional\nchallenges and the disruptive societal wrangle such a retreat would\nprovoke, there are solid reasons for pursuing classroom integration.\nFor instance, although white students’ achievement levels remain steady,\nit is ten times more likely that the academic performance of minority\nstudents will significantly increase rather than significantly decline\nafter desegregation. We must be cautious in our approach to school\ndesegregation not to throw out the baby because it is sitting in some\ndirty bath water.\nThe idea, of course, is to jettison just the water, leaving the baby\nshining from the bath. Right now, though, our baby is soaking in the\nschmutzwasser of increased racial hostility. Fortunately, real hope for\ndraining away that hostility is emerging from the research of education\nspecialists into the concept of “cooperative learning.” Because much of\nthe heightened prejudice from classroom desegregation seems to stem\nfrom increased exposure to outside group members as rivals, these\neducators have experimented with forms of learning in which cooper-\nation rather than competition with classmates is central.\nOff to camp. To understand the logic of the cooperative approach, it\nhelps to reexamine the fascinating, three-decades-old research program\nof Turkish-born social scientist Muzafer Sherif. Intrigued with the issue\nof intergroup conflict, Sherif decided to investigate the process as it\ndeveloped in boys’ summer camps. Although the boys never realized\nthat they were participants in an experiment, Sherif and his associates\nconsistently engaged in artful manipulations of the camp’s social envir-\nonment to observe the effects on group relations.Robert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 135\nIt didn’t take much to bring on certain kinds of ill will. Simply separ-\nating the boys into two residence cabins was enough to stimulate a “we\nvs. they” feeling between the groups; and assigning names to the two\ngroups (the Eagles and the Rattlers) accelerated the sense of rivalry.\nThe boys soon began to demean the qualities and accomplishments of\nthe other group. But these forms of hostility were minor compared to\nwhat occurred when the experimenters purposely introduced compet-\nitive activities into the factions’ meetings with one another. Cabin against\ncabin treasure hunts, tugs-of-war, and athletic contests produced name-\ncalling and physical friction. During the competitions, members of the\nopposing team were labeled “cheaters,” “sneaks,” and “stinkers.” Af-\nterward, cabins were raided, rival banners were stolen and burned,\nthreatening signs were posted, and lunchroom scuffles were common-\nplace.\nAt this point, it was evident to Sherif that the recipe for disharmony\nwas quick and easy: Just separate the participants into groups and let\nsit for a while in their own juices. Then mix together over the flame of\ncontinued competition. And there you have it: Cross-group hatred at\na rolling boil.\nA more challenging issue then faced the experimenters: how to re-\nmove the entrenched hostility they had created. They first tried the\ncontact approach of bringing the bands together more often. But even\nwhen the joint activities were pleasant ones, such as movies and social\nevents, the results were disastrous. Picnics produced food fights, enter-\ntainment programs gave way to shouting contests, dining-hall lines\ndegenerated into shoving matches. Sherif and his research team began\nto worry that in Dr. Frankenstein fashion, they might have created a\nmonster they could no longer control. Then, at the height of the strife,\nthey hit on a resolution that was at once simple and effective.\nThey constructed a series of situations in which competition between\nthe groups would have harmed everyone’s interests, in which coopera-\ntion was necessary for mutual benefit. On a daylong outing, the single\ntruck available to go into town for food was “found” to be stuck. The\nboys were assembled and all pulled and pushed together until the\nvehicle was on its way. In another instance, the researchers arranged\nfor an interruption of the camp’s water supply, which came through\npipes from a distant tank. Presented with the common crisis and realiz-\ning the need for unified action, the boys organized themselves harmo-\nniously to find and fix the problem before day’s end. In yet another\ncircumstance requiring cooperation, the campers were informed that\na desirable movie was available for rental but that the camp could not\nafford it. Aware that the only solution was to combine resources, the136 / Influence\nboys rented the film with pooled money and spent an unusually con-\ngenial evening enjoying it together.\nThe consequences, though not instantaneous, were nonetheless\nstriking. Conjoint efforts toward common goals steadily bridged the\nrancorous rift between the groups. Before long, the verbal baiting had\ndied, the jostling in lines had ended, and the boys had begun to intermix\nat the meal tables. Further, when asked to list their best friends, signi-\nficant numbers changed from an earlier exclusive naming of in-group\nchums to a listing that included boys in the other group. Some even\nthanked the researchers for the opportunity to rate their friends again\nbecause they realized they had changed their minds since the old days.\nIn one revealing episode, the boys were returning from a campfire on\na single bus—something that would have produced bedlam before but\nwas now specifically requested by the boys. When the bus stopped at\na refreshment stand, the boys of one group, with five dollars left in its\ntreasury, decided to treat their former bitter adversaries to milkshakes!\nWe can trace the roots of this surprising turnabout to those times\nwhen the boys had to view one another as allies instead of opponents.\nThe crucial procedure was the experimenters’ imposition of common\ngoals on the groups. It was the cooperation required to achieve these\ngoals that finally allowed the rival group members to experience one\nanother as reasonable fellows, valued helpers, and friends. And when\nsuccess resulted from the mutual efforts, it became especially difficult\nto maintain feelings of hostility toward those who had been teammates\nin the triumph.16\nBack to school. In the welter of racial tensions that followed school\ndesegregation, certain educational psychologists began to see the relev-\nance to the classroom in Sherif’s findings. If only the learning experience\nthere could be modified to include at least occasional interethnic cooper-\nation toward mutual successes, perhaps cross-group friendships would\nhave a place to grow. Although similar projects have been under way\nin various states, an especially interesting approach in this direc-\ntion—termed the “jigsaw classroom”—was developed by Elliot Aronson\nand his colleagues in Texas and California.\nThe essence of the jigsaw route to learning is to require that students\nwork together to master the material scheduled for an upcoming exam-\nination. This is accomplished by forming students into cooperating\nteams and giving each student only one part of the information—one\npiece of the puzzle—necessary to pass the test. Under this system the\nstudents must take turns teaching and helping one another. Everyone\nneeds everyone else to do well. Like Sherif’s campers working on tasks\nthat could be successfully accomplished only conjointly, the students\nbecame allies rather than enemies.Robert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 137\nWhen tried in recently desegregated classrooms, the jigsaw approach\nhas generated impressive results. Studies have shown that, compared\nto other classrooms in the same school using the traditional competitive\nmethod, jigsaw learning stimulated significantly more friendship and\nless prejudice between ethnic groups. Besides this vital reduction in\nhostility, there were other advantages: Self-esteem, liking for school,\nand test scores improved for minority students. And the white students\nbenefited, too. Their self-esteem and liking for school went up, and\ntheir test performance was at least as high as that of whites in the tradi-\ntional classes.\nGains such as these cry out for more detailed explanation. What ex-\nactly goes on in the jigsaw classroom to account for effects we had long\nago lost hope of attaining in the public schools? A case study provided\nby Aronson helps us to understand better. It relates the experience of\nCarlos, a young Mexican-American boy, who found himself in a jigsaw\ngroup for the first time. Carlos’s job was to learn and then convey to\nhis team information on the middle years of Joseph Pulitzer. A test on\nthe famous newspaperman’s life would soon face each group member.\nAronson tells what happened:\nCarlos was not very articulate in English, his second language,\nand because he was often ridiculed when he had spoken up in the\npast, he had learned over the years to keep quiet in class. We might\neven say that Carlos and the teacher had entered into a conspiracy\nof silence. He would become anonymous, buried in the bustle of\nclassroom activity, and not be embarrassed by having to stumble\nover answers; she, in turn, would not call on him. Her decision\nprobably came from the purest of motives; she didn’t want to hu-\nmiliate him, or watch the other kids make fun of him. But by ig-\nnoring Carlos, the teacher had, in effect, written him off. She was\nimplying that he was not worth bothering with; at least that was\nthe message the other kids got. If the teacher wasn’t calling on\nCarlos, it must be because Carlos is stupid. It is likely that Carlos\nhimself came to the same conclusion.\nNaturally, Carlos was quite uncomfortable with the new system,\nwhich required him to talk to his groupmates; he had a great deal\nof trouble communicating his paragraph. He stammered, hesitated,\nand fidgeted. The other kids were not helpful at all; they reacted\nout of their old, overlearned habit. When a kid stumbles, especially\none they think is stupid, they resort to ridicule and teasing. “Aw,\nyou don’t know it,” accused Mary. “You’re dumb; you’re stupid.\nYou don’t know what you’re doing.”138 / Influence\nOne of us, assigned to observe the group process, would inter-\nvene with a bit of advice when she overheard such comments:\n“Okay, you can tease him if you want to,” she said, “and that\nmight be fun for you, but it’s not going to help you learn about\nJoseph Pulitzer’s middle years. The exam will take place in about\nan hour.” Notice how she changed the reinforcement contingencies.\nNow Mary doesn’t gain much from putting Carlos down, and she\nstands to lose a great deal. After a few days and several such ex-\nperiences, it began to dawn on these kids that the only chance they\nhad to learn about Carlos’s segment was by paying attention to\nwhat Carlos had to say.\nAnd with that realization, the kids began to develop into pretty\ngood interviewers, sort of junior Dick Cavetts. Instead of teasing\nCarlos or ignoring him, they learned to draw him out, to ask the\nquestions that made it easier for him to explain out loud what was\nin his head. Carlos, in turn, relaxed more, and this improved his\nability to communicate. After a couple of weeks, the children\nconcluded that Carlos wasn’t nearly as dumb as they thought he\nwas. They saw things in him they hadn’t seen before. They began\nto like him more, and Carlos began to enjoy school more and think\nof his Anglo classmates not as tormentors but as friends.17\nThere is a tendency when faced with positive results like those from\nthe jigsaw classroom to become overly enthusiastic about a single,\nsimple solution to a tenacious problem. Experience should tell us that\nsuch problems rarely yield to a simple remedy. That is no doubt true\nin this case, as well. Even within the boundaries of cooperative learning\nprocedures, the issues are complex. Before we can feel truly comfortable\nwith the jigsaw, or any similar approach to learning and liking, much\nmore research is needed to determine how frequently, in what size\ndoses, at which ages, and in which sorts of groups cooperative strategies\nwill work. We also need to know the best way for teachers to institute\nnew methods—provided they will institute them at all. After all, not\nonly are cooperative learning techniques a radical departure from the\ntraditional, familiar routine of most teachers, they may also threaten\nthe teacher’s sense of importance in the classroom by turning over much\nof the instruction to the students. Finally, we must realize that compet-\nition has its place, too. It can serve as a valuable motivator of desirable\naction and an important builder of self-concept. The task, then, is not\nto eliminate academic competition but to break its monopoly in the\nclassroom by introducing regular cooperative successes that include\nmembers of all ethnic groups.18\nDespite these qualifications, I cannot help but be encouraged by theRobert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 139\nevidence to date. When I talk to my students, or even my neighbors\nand friends, about the prospects for cooperative learning approaches,\nI can feel optimism rise in me. The public schools have for so long been\nthe source of discouraging news—sinking test scores, teacher burnout,\nincreasing crime, and, of course, racial conflict. Now there is at least\none crack in the gloom, and I find myself genuinely excited about it.\nWhat’s the point of this digression into the effects of school desegreg-\nation on race relations? The point is to make two points. First, although\nthe familiarity produced by contact usually leads to greater liking, the\nopposite occurs if the contact carries distasteful experiences with it.\nTherefore, when children of different racial groups are thrown into the\nincessant, harsh competition of the standard American classroom, we\nought to see—and we do see—the worsening of hostilities. Second, the\nevidence that team-oriented learning is an antidote to this disorder may\ntell us about the heavy impact of cooperation on the liking process.\nBut before we assume that cooperation is a powerful cause of liking,\nwe should first pass it through what, to my mind, is the acid test: Do\ncompliance practitioners systematically use cooperation to get us to\nlike them so we will say yes to their requests? Do they point it out when\nit exists naturally in a situation? Do they try to amplify it when it exists\nonly weakly? And, most instructive of all, do they manufacture it when\nit is absent?\nAs it turns out, cooperation passes the test with colors flying. Com-\npliance professionals are forever attempting to establish that we and\nthey are working for the same goals, that we must “pull together” for\nmutual benefit, that they are, in essence, our teammates. A host of ex-\namples is possible. Most are familiar, like the new-car salesman who\ntakes our side and “does battle” with his boss to secure us a good deal.19\nBut one rather spectacular illustration occurs in a setting few of us\nwould recognize firsthand, because the professionals are police inter-\nrogators whose job is to induce suspects to confess to crime.\nIn recent years, the courts have imposed a variety of restrictions on\nthe way police must behave in handling suspected criminals, especially\nin seeking confessions. Many procedures that in the past led to admis-\nsions of guilt can no longer be employed for fear that they will result\nin a judge’s dismissal of the case. As yet, however, the courts have found\nnothing illegal in the use by the police of subtle psychology. For this\nreason, criminal interrogations have taken increasingly to the use of\nsuch ploys as the one they call Good Cop/Bad Cop.\nGood Cop/Bad Cop works as follows: A young robbery suspect, let’s\nsay, who has been advised of his rights and is maintaining his innocence,\nis brought to a room to be questioned by a pair of officers. One of the140 / Influence\nofficers, either because the part suits him or because it is merely his\nturn, plays the role of Bad Cop. Before the suspect even sits down, Bad\nCop curses “the son of a bitch” for the robbery. For the rest of the session\nhis words come only with snarls and growls. He kicks the prisoner’s\nchair to emphasize his points. When he looks at the man, he seems to\nsee a mound of garbage. If the suspect challenges Bad Cop’s accusations\nor just refuses to answer them, Bad Cop becomes livid. His rage soars.\nHe swears he will do everything possible to assure a maximum sentence.\nHe says he has friends in the district attorney’s office who will hear\nfrom him of the suspect’s noncooperative attitude and who will prosec-\nute the case hard.\nAt the outset of Bad Cop’s performance, his partner, Good Cop, sits\nin the background. Then, slowly, he starts to chip in. First he speaks\nonly to Bad Cop, trying to temper the burgeoning anger. “Calm down,\nFrank, calm down.” But Bad Cop shouts back, “Don’t tell me to calm\ndown when he’s lying right to my face! I hate these lying bastards!” A\nbit later, Good Cop actually says something in the suspect’s behalf.\n“Take it easy, Frank, he’s only a kid.” Not much in the way of support,\nbut compared to the rantings of Bad Cop, the words fall like music on\nthe prisoner’s ears. Still, Bad Cop is unconvinced. “Kid? He’s no kid.\nHe’s a punk. That’s what he is, a punk. And I’ll tell you something else.\nHe’s over eighteen, and that’s all I need to get his ass sent so far behind\nbars they’ll need a flashlight to find him.”\nNow Good Cop begins to speak directly to the young man, calling\nhim by his first name and pointing out any positive details of the case.\n“I’ll tell you, Kenny, you’re lucky that nobody was hurt and you weren’t\narmed. When you come up for sentencing, that’ll look good.” If the\nsuspect persists in claiming innocence, Bad Cop launches into another\ntirade of curses and threats. But this time Good Cop stops him, “Okay,\nFrank,” handing Bad Cop some money, “I think we could all use some\ncoffee. How about getting us three cups?” When Bad Cop is gone, it’s\ntime for Good Cop’s big scene: “Look, man, I don’t know why, but my\npartner doesn’t like you, and he’s gonna try to get you. And he’s gonna\nbe able to do it because we’ve got enough evidence right now. And he’s\nright about the D.A.’s office going hard on guys who don’t cooperate.\nYou’re looking at five years, man, five years! Now, I don’t want to see\nthat happen to you. So if you admit you robbed that place right now,\nbefore he gets back, I’ll take charge of your case and put in a good word\nfor you to the D.A. If we work together on this, we can cut that five\nyears down to two, maybe one. Do us both a favor, Kenny. Just tell me\nhow you did it, and then let’s start working on getting you through\nthis.” A full confession frequently follows.\nGood Cop/Bad Cop works as well as it does for several reasons: TheRobert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 141\nfear of long incarceration is quickly instilled by Bad Cop’s threats; the\nperceptual contrast principle ensures that compared to the raving,\nvenomous Bad Cop, the interrogator playing Good Cop will seem like\nan especially reasonable and kind man; and because Good Cop has in-\ntervened repeatedly on the suspect’s behalf—has even spent his own\nmoney for a cup of coffee—the reciprocity rule pressures for a return\nfavor. The big reason that the technique is effective, though, is that it\ngives the suspect the idea that there is someone on his side, someone\nwith his welfare in mind, someone working together with him, for him.\nIn most situations, such a person would be viewed very favorably, but\nin the deep trouble our robbery suspect finds himself, that person takes\non the character of a savior. And from savior, it is but a short step to\ntrusted father confessor.\nConditioning and Association\n“Why do they blame me, Doc?” It was the shaky telephone voice of a\nlocal TV weatherman. He had been given my number when he called\nthe psychology department at my university to find someone who could\nanswer his question—a question that had always puzzled him but had\nrecently begun to bother and depress him.\n“I mean, it’s crazy, isn’t it? Everybody knows that I just report the\nweather, that I don’t order it, right? So how come I get so much flak\nwhen the weather’s bad? During the floods last year, I got hate mail!\nOne guy threatened to shoot me if it didn’t stop raining. Christ, I’m still\nlooking over my shoulder from that one. And the people I work with\nat the station do it, too! Sometimes, right on the air, they’ll zing me\nabout a heat wave or something. They have to know that I’m not re-\nsponsible, but that doesn’t seem to stop them. Can you help me under-\nstand this, Doc? It’s really getting me down.”\nWe made an appointment to talk in my office, where I tried to explain\nthat he was the victim of an age-old click, whirr response that people\nhave to things they perceive as merely connected to one another. In-\nstances of this response abound in modern life. But I felt that the ex-\nample most likely to help the distressed weatherman would require a\nbit of ancient history. I asked him to consider the precarious fate of the\nimperial messengers of old Persia. Any such messenger assigned the\nrole of military courier had special cause to hope mightily for Persian\nbattlefield successes. With news of victory in his pouch, he would be\ntreated as a hero upon his arrival at the palace. The food, drink, and\nwomen of his choice were provided gladly and sumptuously. Should\nhis message tell of military disaster, though, the reception would be\nquite different: He was summarily slain.142 / Influence\nI hoped that the point of this story would not be lost on the\nweatherman. I wanted him to be aware of a fact that is as true today as\nit was in the time of ancient Persia, or, for that matter, in the time of\nShakespeare, who captured the essence of it with one vivid line. “The\nnature of bad news,” he said, “infects the teller.” There is a natural hu-\nman tendency to dislike a person who brings us unpleas-ant informa-\ntion, even when that person did not cause the bad news. The simple\nassociation with it is enough to stimulate our dislike.20\nBut there was something else I hoped the weatherman would get\nfrom the historical examples. Not only was he joined in his predicament\nby centuries of other “tellers,” but also, compared to some, such as the\nPersian messengers, he was very well-off. At the end of our session, he\nsaid something to convince me that he appreciated this point quite\nclearly. “Doc,” he said on his way out, “I feel a lot better about my job\nnow. I mean, I’m in Phoenix where the sun shines three hundred days\na year, right? Thank God I don’t do the weather in Buffalo.”\nThe weatherman’s parting comment reveals that he understood more\nthan I had told him about the principle that was influencing his viewers’\nliking for him. Being connected with bad weather does have a negative\neffect. But on the other side of the coin, being connected with sunshine\nshould do wonders for his popularity. And he was right. The principle\nof association is a general one, governing both negative and positive\nconnections. An innocent association with either bad things or good\nthings will influence how people feel about us.21\nWeathermen pay price\nfor nature’s curve balls\nBy David L. Langford\nAssociated Press\nTelevision weather forecasters make a good living talking about the\nweather, but when Mother Nature throws a curve ball, they duck for cover.\nConversations with several veteran prognosticators across the country this week\nturned up stories of them being whacked by old ladies with umbrellas, accosted\nby drunks in bars, pelted with snowballs and galoshes, threatened with death, and\naccused of trying to play God.\n“I had one guy call and tell me that if it snowed over Christmas, I wouldn’t live\nto see New Year’s,” said Bob Gregory, who has been the forecaster at WTHR-TV\nin Indianapolis for nine years.\nMost of the forecasters claimed they are accurate 80 percent to 90 percent of the\ntime on one-day forecasts, but longer-range predictions get tricky. And most con-\nceded they are simply reporting information supplied by computers and anonymous\nmeterologists from the National Weather Service or a private agency.Robert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 143\nBut it’s the face on the television screen that people go after.\nTom Bonner, 35, who has been with KARK-TV in Little Rock, Ark., for 11 years,\nremembers the time a burly farmer from Lonoke, with too much to drink, walked\nup to him in a bar, poked a finger in his chest and said: “You’re the one that sent\nthat tornado and tore my house up…I’m going to take your head off.”\nBonner said he looked for the bouncer, couldn’t spot him, and replied, “That’s\nright about the tornado, and I’ll tell you something else, I’ll send another one if you\ndon’t back off.”\nSeveral years ago, when a major flood left water 10 feet deep in San Diego’s\nMission Valley, Mike Ambrose of KGTV recalls that a woman walked up to his car,\nwhacked the windshield with an umbrella and said, “This rain is your fault.”\nChuck Whitaker of WSBT-TV in South Bend, Ind., says, “One little old lady called\nthe police department and wanted the weatherman arrested for bringing all the\nsnow.”\nA woman upset that it had rained for her daughter’s wedding called Tom Jolls\nof WKBW-TV in Buffalo, N.Y., to give him a piece of her mind. “She held me re-\nsponsible and said if she ever met me she would probably hit me,” he said.\nSonny Eliot of WJBK-TV, a forecaster in the Detroit area for 30 years, recalls\npredicting 2 to 4 inches of snow in the city several years ago and more than 8 came\ndown. To retaliate, his colleagues at the station set up a contraption that rained\nabout 200 galoshes on him while he was giving the forecast the next day.\n“I’ve still got the lumps to prove it,” he says.\nFIGURE 5-2\nWeatherbeaten\nNote the similarities between the account of the weatherman who came\nto my office and those of other TV weather reporters.\n(DAVID L. LANGFORD, ASSOCIATED PRESS)\nOur instruction in how the negative association works seems to have\nbeen primarily undertaken by the mothers of our society. Remember\nhow they were always warning us against playing with the bad kids\ndown the street? Remember how they said it didn’t matter if we did\nnothing bad ourselves because, in the eyes of the neighborhood, we\nwould be “known by the company we kept.” Our mothers were teaching\nus about guilt by association. They were giving us a lesson in the neg-\native side of the principle of association. And they were right. People\ndo assume that we have the same personality traits as our friends.22\nAs for the positive associations, it is the compliance professionals\nwho teach the lesson. They are incessantly trying to connect themselves\nor their products with the things we like. Did you ever wonder what\nall those good-looking models are doing standing around in the auto-\nmobile ads? What the advertiser hopes they are doing is lending their144 / Influence\npositive traits—beauty and desirability—to the cars. The advertiser is\nbetting that we will respond to the product in the same ways we respond\nto the attractive models merely associated with it.\nAnd they are right. In one study, men who saw a new-car ad that\nincluded a seductive young woman model rated the car as faster, more\nappealing, more expensive-looking, and better designed than did men\nwho viewed the same ad without the model. Yet when asked later, the\nmen refused to believe that the presence of the young woman had in-\nfluenced their judgments.23\nBecause the association principle works so well—and so uncon-\nsciously—manufacturers regularly rush to connect their products with\nthe current cultural rage. During the days of the first American moon\nshot, everything from breakfast drink to deodorant was sold with allu-\nsions to the U.S. space program. In Olympiad years, we are told precisely\nwhich is the “official” hair spray and facial tissue of our Olympic\nteams.24 During the 1970s, when the magic cultural concept appeared\nto be “naturalness,” the “natural” bandwagon was crowded to capacity.\nSometimes the connections to naturalness didn’t even make sense:\n“Change your hair color naturally,” urged one popular TV commercial.\nThe linking of celebrities to products is another way advertisers cash\nin on the association principle. Professional athletes are paid to connect\nthemselves to things that can be directly relevant to their roles (sport\nshoes, tennis rackets, golf balls) or wholly irrelevant (soft drinks, pop-\ncorn poppers, panty hose). The important thing for the advertiser is to\nestablish the connection; it doesn’t have to be a logical one, just a positive\none.\nOf course, popular entertainers provide another form of desirability\nthat manufacturers have always paid dearly to tie to their goods. But\nrecently, politicians have caught on to the ability of a celebrity linkage\nto sway voters. Presidential candidates assemble stables of well-known\nnonpolitical figures who either actively participate in the campaign or\nmerely lend their names to it. Even at the state and local level, a similar\ngame is played. Take as evidence the comment of a Los Angeles woman\nI overheard expressing her conflicting feelings about a California refer-\nendum to limit smoking in public places. “It’s a real tough decision.\nThey’ve got big stars speaking for it, and big stars speaking against it.\nYou don’t know how to vote.”\nIf politicians are relative newcomers to the use of celebrity endorse-\nments, they are old hands at exploiting the association principle in\nother ways. For example, congressional representatives traditionally\nannounce to the press the start of federal projects that will bring new\njobs or benefits to their home states; this is true even when a represent-Robert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 145\native has had nothing to do with advancing the project or has, in some\ncases, voted against it.\nWhile politicians have long strained to associate themselves with the\nvalues of motherhood, country, and apple pie, it may be in the last of\nthese connections—to food—that they have been most clever. For in-\nstance, it is White House tradition to try to sway the votes of balking\nlegislators over a meal. It can be a picnic lunch, a sumptuous breakfast,\nor an elegant dinner; but when an important bill is up for grabs, out\ncomes the silverware. And political fund-raising these days regularly\ninvolves the presentation of food. Notice, too, that at the typical fund-\nraising dinner the speeches, the appeals for further contributions and\nheightened effort never come before the meal is served, only during or\nafter. The advantages to this pairing of the affairs of the table with those\nof the state are several: For example, time is saved and the reciprocity\nrule is engaged. The least recognized benefit, however, may be the one\nuncovered in research conducted in the 1930s by the distinguished\npsychologist Gregory Razran.\nUsing what he termed the “luncheon technique,” he found that his\nsubjects became fonder of the people and things they experienced while\nthey were eating. In the example most relevant for our purposes,\nRazran’s subjects were presented with some political statements they\nhad rated once before. At the end of the experiment, after all the polit-\nical statements had been presented, Razran found that only certain of\nthem had gained in approval—those that had been shown while food\nwas being eaten. And these changes in liking seem to have occurred\nunconsciously, since the subjects could not remember which of the\nstatements they had seen during the food service.\nHow did Razran come up with the luncheon technique? What made\nhim think it would work? The answer may lie in the dual scholarly\nroles he played during his career. Not only was he a respected independ-\nent researcher, he was also one of the earliest translators into English\nof the pioneering psychological literature of Russia. It was a literature\ndedicated to the study of the association principle and dominated by\nthe thinking of a brilliant man, Ivan Pavlov.\nAlthough a scientist of varied and elaborated talent—he had, for in-\nstance, won a Nobel Prize years earlier for his work on the digestive\nsystem—Pavlov’s most important experimental demonstration was\nsimplicity itself. He showed that he could get an animal’s typical re-\nsponse to food (salivation) to be directed toward something irrelevant\nto food (a bell) merely by connecting the two things in the animal’s\nmind. If the presentation of food to a dog was always accompanied by\nthe sound of a bell, soon the dog would salivate to the bell alone, even\nwhen there was no food to be had.146 / Influence\nIt is not a long step from Pavlov’s classic demonstration to Razran’s\nluncheon technique. Obviously, a normal reaction to food can be\ntransferred to some other thing through the process of raw association.\nRazran’s insight was that there are many normal responses to food be-\nsides salivation, one of them being a good and favorable feeling.\nTherefore, it is possible to attach this pleasant feeling, this positive atti-\ntude, to anything (political statements being only an example) that is\nclosely associated with good food.\nNor is there a long step from the luncheon technique to the compli-\nance professionals’ realization that all kinds of desirable things can\nsubstitute for food in lending their likable qualities to the ideas,\nproducts, and people artificially linked to them. In the final analysis,\nthen, that is why those good-looking models are standing around in\nthe magazine ads. And that is why radio programmers are instructed\nto insert the station’s call-letters jingle immediately before a big hit song\nis played. And that is even why the women playing Barnyard Bingo at\na Tupperware party must yell the word “Tupperware” rather than\n“Bingo” before they can rush to the center of the floor for a prize. It\nmay be “Tupperware” for the women, but it’s “Bingo” for the company.\nJust because we are often the unaware victims of compliance practi-\ntioners’ use of the association principle doesn’t mean that we don’t\nunderstand how it works or don’t use it ourselves. There is ample\nevidence, for instance, that we understand fully the predicament of a\nPersian imperial messenger or modern-day weatherman announcing\nbad news. In fact, we can be counted on to take steps to avoid putting\nourselves in any similar positions. Research done at the University of\nGeorgia shows just how we operate when faced with the task of com-\nmunicating good or bad news. Students waiting for an experiment to\nbegin were given the job of informing a fellow student that an important\nphone call had come in for him. Half the time the call was supposed to\nbring good news and half the time, bad news. The researchers found\nthat the students conveyed the information very differently, depending\non its quality. When the news was positive, the tellers were sure to\nmention that feature: “You just got a phone call with great news. Better\nsee the experimenter for the details.” But when the news was unfavor-\nable, they kept themselves apart from it: “You just got a phone call.\nBetter see the experimenter for the details.” Obviously, the students\nhad previously learned that, to be liked, they should connect themselves\nto good news but not bad news.25\nA lot of strange behavior can be explained by the fact that people\nunderstand the association principle well enough to strive to linkRobert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 147\nthemselves to positive events and separate themselves from negative\nevents—even when they have not caused the events. Some of the\nstrangest of such behavior takes place in the great arena of sports. The\nactions of the athletes are not the issue here, though. After all, in the\nheated contact of the game, they are entitled to an occasional eccentric\noutburst. Instead, it is the often raging, irrational, boundless fervor of\nthe sports fan that seems, on its face, so puzzling. How can we account\nfor wild sports riots in Europe, or the murder of players and referees\nby South American soccer crowds gone berserk, or the unnecessary\nlavishness of the gifts provided by local fans to already wealthy\nAmerican ballplayers on the special “day” set aside to honor them?\nRationally, none of this makes sense. It’s just a game! Isn’t it?\nHardly. The relationship between sport and the earnest fan is anything\nbut gamelike. It is serious, intense, and highly personal. An apt illustra-\ntion comes from one of my favorite anecdotes. It concerns a World War\nII soldier who returned to his home in the Balkans after the war and\nshortly thereafter stopped speaking. Medical examinations could find\nno physical cause for the problem. There was no wound, no brain\ndamage, no vocal impairment. He could read, write, understand a\nconversation, and follow orders. Yet he would not talk—not for his\ndoctors, not for his friends, not even for his pleading family.\nPerplexed and exasperated, his doctors moved him to another city\nand placed him in a veterans’ hospital where he remained for thirty\nyears, never breaking his self-imposed silence and sinking into a life of\nsocial isolation. Then one day, a radio in his ward happened to be tuned\nto a soccer match between his hometown team and a traditional rival.\nWhen at a crucial point of play the referee called a foul against a player\nfrom the man’s home team, the mute veteran jumped from his chair,\nglared at the radio, and spoke his first words in more than three decades:\n“You dumb ass!” he cried. “Are you trying to give them the match?”\nWith that, he returned to his chair and to a silence he never again viol-\nated.\nThere are two important lessons to be derived from this true story.\nThe first concerns the sheer power of the phenomenon. The veteran’s\ndesire to have his hometown team succeed was so strong that it alone\nproduced a deviation from his solidly entrenched way of life. Similar\neffects of sports events on the long-standing habits of fans are far from\nunique to the back wards of veterans’ hospitals. During the 1980 Winter\nOlympics, after the U.S. hockey team had upset the vastly favored Soviet\nteam, the teetotaling father of the American goaltender, Jim Craig, was\noffered a flask. “I’ve never had a drink in my life,” he reported later,\n“but someone behind me handed me cognac. I drank it. Yes, I did.” Nor\nwas such unusual behavior unique to parents of the players. Fans out-148 / Influence\nside the hockey arena were described in news accounts as delirious:\n“They hugged, sang, and turned somersaults in the snow.” Even those\nfans not present at Lake Placid exulted in the victory and displayed\ntheir pride with bizarre behavior. In Raleigh, North Carolina, a swim\nmeet had to be halted when, after the hockey score was announced, the\ncompetitors and audience alike chanted “U.S.A.! U.S.A.!” until they\nwere hoarse. In Cambridge, Massachusetts, a quiet supermarket erupted\nat the news into a riot of flying toilet tissue and paper towel streamers.\nThe customers were joined in their spree—and soon led—by the market\nemployees and manager.\nWithout question, the force is deep and sweeping. But if we return\nto the account of the silent veteran, we can see that something else is\nrevealed about the nature of the union of sports and sports fan, some-\nthing crucial to its basic character: It is a personal thing. Whatever\nfragment of an identity that ravaged, mute man still possessed was\nengaged by soccer play. No matter how weakened his ego may have\nbecome after thirty years of wordless stagnation in a hospital ward, it\nwas involved in the outcome of the match. Why? Because he, personally,\nwould be diminished by a hometown defeat. How? Through the prin-\nciple of association. The mere connection of birthplace hooked him,\nwrapped him, tied him to the approaching triumph or failure. As dis-\ntinguished author Isaac Asimov put it in describing our reactions to\nthe contests we view, “All things being equal, you root for your own\nsex, your own culture, your own locality…and what you want to prove\nis that you are better than the other person. Whomever you root for\nrepresents you; and when he wins, you win.”26\nWhen viewed in this light, the passion of the sports fan begins to\nmake sense. The game is no light diversion to be enjoyed for its inherent\nform and artistry. The self is at stake. That is why hometown crowds\nare so adoring and, more tellingly, so grateful toward those regularly\nresponsible for home-team victories. That is also why the same crowds\nare often ferocious in their treatment of players, coaches, and officials\nimplicated in athletic failures.\nFans’ intolerance of defeat can shorten the careers of even successful\nplayers and coaches. Take the case of Frank Layden, who abruptly quit\nas coach of the NBA’s Utah Jazz while the team was leading the league’s\nMidwest Division. Layden’s relative success, warm humor, and widely\nknown charitable activities in the Salt Lake City area were not enough\nto shield him from the ire of some Jazz supporters after team losses.\nCiting a brace of incidents with abusive fans, including one in which\npeople waited around for an hour to curse at him following a defeat,\nLayden explained his decision: “Sometimes in the NBA, you feel like\na dog. I’ve had people spit on me. I had a guy come up to me and say,Robert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 149\n‘I’m a lawyer. Hit me, hit me, so I can sue you.’ I think America takes\nall sports too seriously.”\nSo we want our affiliated sports teams to win to prove our own su-\nperiority. But to whom are we trying to prove it? Ourselves, certainly;\nbut to everyone else, too. According to the association principle, if we\ncan surround ourselves with success that we are connected with in even\na superficial way (for example, place of residence), our public prestige\nwill rise.\nAre sports fans right to think that without ever throwing a block,\ncatching a ball, scoring a goal, or perhaps even attending a game, they\nwill receive some of the glory from a hometown championship? I believe\nso. The evidence is in their favor. Recall that Persia’s messengers did\nnot have to cause the news, my weatherman did not have to cause the\nweather, and Pavlov’s bell did not have to cause the food for powerful\neffects to occur. The association was enough.\nIt is for this reason that, were the University of Southern California\nto win the Rose Bowl, we could expect people with a Southern Cal\nconnection to try to increase the visibility of that connection in any of\na variety of ways. In one experiment showing how wearing apparel\ncan serve to proclaim such an association, researchers counted the\nnumber of school sweatshirts worn on Monday mornings by students\non the campuses of seven prominent football universities: Arizona State,\nLouisiana State, Notre Dame, Michigan, Ohio State, Pittsburgh, and\nSouthern California. The results showed that many more home-school\nshirts were worn if the football team had won its game on the prior\nSaturday. What’s more, the larger the margin of victory, the more such\nshirts appeared. It wasn’t a close, hard-fought game that caused the\nstudents to dress themselves, literally, in success; instead, it was a clear,\ncrushing conquest smacking of indisputable superiority.\nThis tendency to try to bask in reflected glory by publicly trumpeting\nour connections to successful others has its mirror image in our attempt\nto avoid being darkened by the shadow of others’ defeat. In an amazing\ndisplay during the luckless 1980 season, season-ticket-holding fans of\nthe New Orleans Saints football team began to appear at the stadium\nwearing paper bags to conceal their faces. As their team suffered loss\nafter loss, more and more fans donned the bags until TV cameras were\nregularly able to record the extraordinary image of gathered masses of\npeople shrouded in brown paper with nothing to identify them but the\ntips of their noses. I find it instructive that during a late-season contest,\nwhen it was clear that the Saints were at last going to win one, the fans\ndiscarded their bags and went public once more.\nAll this tells me that we purposefully manipulate the visibility of our\nconnections with winners and losers in order to make ourselves look150 / Influence\ngood to anyone who could view these connections. By showcasing the\npositive associations and burying the negative ones, we are trying to\nget observers to think more highly of us and to like us more. There are\nmany ways we go about this, but one of the simplest and most pervasive\nis in the pronouns we use. Have you noticed, for example, how often\nafter a home-team victory fans crowd into the range of a TV camera,\nthrust their index fingers high, and shout, “We’re number one! We’re\nnumber one!” Note that the call is not “They’re number one” or even\n“Our team is number one.” The pronoun is “we,” designed to imply\nthe closest possible identity with the team.\nNote also that nothing similar occurs in the case of failure. No televi-\nsion viewer will ever hear the chant, “We’re in last place! We’re in last\nplace!” Home-team defeats are the times for distancing oneself. Here\n“we” is not nearly as preferred as the insulating pronoun “they.” To\nprove the point, I once did a small experiment in which students at\nArizona State University were phoned and asked to describe the out-\ncome of a football game their school team had played a few weeks\nearlier. Some of the students were asked the outcome of a certain game\ntheir team had lost; the other students were asked the outcome of a\ndifferent game—one their team had won. My fellow researcher, Avril\nThorne, and I simply listened to what was said and recorded the per-\ncentage of students who used the word “we” in their descriptions.\nWhen the results were tabulated, it was obvious that the students had\ntried to connect themselves to success by using the pronoun “we” to\ndescribe their school-team victory—“We beat Houston, seventeen to\nfourteen,” or “We won.” In the case of the lost game, however, “we”\nwas rarely used. Instead, the students used terms designed to keep\nthemselves separate from their vanquished team—“They lost to Mis-\nsouri, thirty to twenty,” or “I don’t know the score, but Arizona State\ngot beat.” Perhaps the twin desires to connect ourselves to winners and\nto distance ourselves from losers were combined consummately in the\nremarks of one particular student. After dryly recounting the score of\nthe home-team defeat—“Arizona State lost it, thirty to twenty”—he\nblurted in anguish, “They threw away our chance for a national champi-\nonship!”27\nIf it is true that, to make ourselves look good, we try to bask in the\nreflected glory of the successes we are even remotely associated with,\na provocative implication emerges: We will be most likely to use this\napproach when we feel that we don’t look so good. When-ever our\npublic image is damaged, we will experience an increased desire to re-\nstore that image by trumpeting our ties to successful others. At the same\ntime, we will most scrupulously avoid publicizing our ties to failingRobert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 151\nothers. Support for these ideas comes from the telephone study of Ari-\nzona State University students. Before being asked about the home-\nteam victory or loss, they were given a test of their general knowledge.\nThe test was rigged so that some of the students would fail badly while\nthe others would do quite well.\nSo at the time they were asked to describe the football score, half of\nthe students had experienced recent image damage from their failure\nof the test. These students later showed the greatest need to manipulate\ntheir connections with the football team to salvage their prestige. If they\nwere asked to describe the team defeat, only 17 percent used the pro-\nnoun “we” in so doing. If, however, they were asked to describe the\nwin, 41 percent said “we.”\nThe story was very different, though, for the students who had done\nwell on the general knowledge test. They later used “we” about equally,\nwhether they were describing a home-team victory (25 percent) or defeat\n(24 percent). These students had bolstered their images through their\nown achievement and didn’t need to do so through the achievement\nof others. This finding tells me that it is not when we have a strong\nfeeling of recognized personal accomplishment that we will seek to\nbask in reflected glory. Instead, it will be when prestige (both public\nand private) is low that we will be intent upon using the successes of\nassociated others to help restore image.\nI think it revealing that the remarkable hubbub following the Amer-\nican hockey team victory in the 1980 Olympics came at a time of recently\ndiminished American prestige. The U.S. government had been helpless\nto prevent both the holding of American hostages in Iran and the Soviet\ninvasion of Afghanistan. It was a time when, as a citizenry, we needed\nthe triumph of that hockey team and we needed to display or even\nmanufacture our connections to it. We should not be surprised to learn,\nfor instance, that outside the hockey arena, in the aftermath of the win\nover the Soviet team, scalpers were getting a hundred dollars a pair for\nticket stubs.\nAlthough the desire to bask in reflected glory exists to a degree in all\nof us, there seems to be something special about people who would\nwait in the snow to spend fifty dollars apiece for the shreds of tickets\nto a game they had not attended, presumably to “prove” to friends back\nhome that they had been present at the big victory. Just what kind of\npeople are they? Unless I miss my guess, they are not merely great\nsports aficionados; they are individuals with a hidden personality\nflaw—a poor self-concept. Deep inside is a sense of low personal worth\nthat directs them to seek prestige not from the generation or promotion\nof their own attainments, but from the generation or promotion of their\nassociations with others of attainment. There are several varieties of152 / Influence\nthis species that bloom throughout our culture. The persistent name-\ndropper is a classic example. So, too, is the rock-music groupie, who\ntrades sexual favors for the right to tell girlfriends that she was “with”\na famous musician for a time. No matter which form it takes, the beha-\nvior of such individuals shares a similar theme—the rather tragic view\nof accomplishment as deriving from outside the self.\nCertain of these people work the association principle in a slightly\ndifferent way. Instead of striving to inflate their visible connections to\nothers of success, they strive to inflate the success of others they are\nvisibly connected to. The clearest illustration is the notorious “stage\nmother,” obsessed with securing stardom for her child. Of course, wo-\nmen are not alone in this regard. In 1991 a Davenport, Iowa, obstetrician\ncut off service to the wives of three school officials, reportedly because\nhis son had not been given enough playing time in school basketball\ngames. One of the wives was eight months’ pregnant at the time.\nPhysicians’ wives often speak of the pressures to obtain personal\nprestige by association with their husband’s professional stature. John\nPekkanen, who authored the book The Best Doctors in the U.S., reports\nthat many enraged protests to his list came not from the physicians\nwho were omitted but from their wives. In one instance that reveals\nthe extent to which the principle of association dominates the thinking\nof some of these women, Pekkanen received a letter from a frantic wife\nalong with her proof that her husband deserved to be on the list of best\ndoctors. It was a photograph of the man with Merv Griffin.\nHOW TO SAY NO\nBecause liking can be increased by many means, a proper consideration\nof defenses against compliance professionals who employ the liking\nrule must, oddly enough, be a short one. It would be pointless to con-\nstruct a horde of specific countertactics to combat each of the myriad\nversions of the various ways to influence liking. There are simply too\nmany routes to be blocked effectively with such a one-on-one strategy.\nBesides, several of the factors leading to liking—physical attractiveness,\nfamiliarity, association—have been shown to work unconsciously to\nproduce their effects on us, making it unlikely that we could muster a\ntimely protection against them.\nInstead we need to consider a general approach, one that can be ap-\nplied to any of the liking-related factors to neutralize their unwelcome\ninfluence on our compliance decisions. The secret to such an approach\nmay lie in its timing. Rather than trying to recognize and prevent the\naction of liking factors before they have a chance to work on us, we\nmight be well advised to let them work. Our vigilance should be directedRobert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 153\nnot toward the things that may produce undue liking for a compliance\npractitioner, but toward the fact that undue liking has been produced.\nThe time to react protectively is when we feel ourselves liking the\npractitioner more than we should under the circumstances.\nBy concentrating our attention on the effect rather than the causes,\nwe can avoid the laborious, nearly impossible task of trying to detect\nand deflect the many psychological influences on liking. Instead, we\nhave to be sensitive to only one thing related to liking in our contacts\nwith compliance practitioners: the feeling that we have come to like the\npractitioner more quickly or more deeply than we would have expected.\nOnce we notice this feeling, we will have been tipped off that there is\nprobably some tactic being used, and we can start taking the necessary\ncountermeasures. Note that the strategy I am suggesting borrows much\nfrom the jujitsu style favored by the compliance professionals them-\nselves. We don’t attempt to restrain the influence of the factors that\ncause liking. Quite the contrary. We allow these factors to exert their\nforce, and then we use that force in our campaign against them. The\nstronger the force, the more conspicuous it becomes and, consequently,\nthe more subject to our alerted defenses.\nSuppose, for example, we find ourselves bargaining on the price of\na new car with Dealin’ Dan, a candidate for Joe Girard’s vacated\n“greatest car salesman” title. After talking a while and negotiating a\nbit, Dan wants to close the deal; he wants us to decide to buy the car.\nBefore any such decision is made, it would be important to ask ourselves\na crucial question: “In the twenty-five minutes I’ve known this guy,\nhave I come to like him more than I would have expected?” If the answer\nis yes, we might want to reflect upon whether Dan behaved during\nthose few minutes in ways that we know affect liking. We might recall\nthat he had fed us (coffee and doughnuts) before launching into his\npitch, that he had complimented us on our choice of options and color\ncombinations, that he had made us laugh, that he had cooperated with\nus against the sales manager to get us a better deal.\nAlthough such a review of events might be informative, it is not a\nnecessary step in protecting ourselves from the liking rule. Once we\ndiscover that we have come to like Dan more than we would have ex-\npected to, we don’t have to know why. The simple recognition of un-\nwarranted liking should be enough to get us to react against it. One\npossible reaction would be to reverse the process and actively dislike\nDan. But that might be unfair to him and contrary to our own interests.\nAfter all, some individuals are naturally likable, and Dan might just be\none of them. It wouldn’t be right to turn automatically against those\ncompliance professionals who happen to be most likable. Besides, for\nour own sakes, we wouldn’t want to shut ourselves off from business154 / Influence\ninteractions with such nice people, especially when they may be offering\nus the best available deal.\nI would recommend a different reaction. If our answer to the crucial\nquestion is “Yes, under the circumstances, I like this guy peculiarly\nwell,” this should be the signal that the time has come for a quick\ncountermaneuver: Mentally separate Dan from that Chevy or Toyota\nhe’s trying to sell. It is vital to remember at this point that, should we\ndecide for Dan’s car, we will be driving it, not him, off the dealership\nlot. It is irrelevant to a wise automobile purchase that we find Dan\nlikable because he is good-looking, claims an interest in our favorite\nhobby, is funny, or has relatives back where we grew up.\nOur proper response, then, is a conscious effort to concentrate exclus-\nively on the merits of the deal and car Dan has for us. Of course, in\nmaking a compliance decision, it is always a good idea to keep separate\nour feelings about the requester and the request. But once immersed in\neven a brief personal and sociable contact with a requester, that distinc-\ntion is easy to forget. In those instances when we don’t care one way\nor the other about a requester, forgetting to make the distinction won’t\nsteer us very far wrong. The big mistakes are likely to come when we\nare fond of the person making a request.\nThat’s why it is so important to be alert to a sense of undue liking for\na compliance practitioner. The recognition of that feeling can serve as\nour reminder to separate the dealer from the merits of the deal and to\nmake our decision based on considerations related only to the latter.\nWere we all to follow this procedure, I am certain we would be much\nmore pleased with the results of our exchanges with compliance profes-\nsionals—though I suspect that Dealin’ Dan would not.\nREADER’S REPORT\nFrom a Chicago Man\n“Although I’ve never been to a Tupperware party, I recognized the\nsame kind of friendship pressures recently when I got a call from a\nlong-distance-phone-company saleswoman. She told me that one of\nmy buddies had placed my name on something called the MCI Friends\nand Family Calling Circle.\n“This friend of mine, Brad, is a guy I grew up with but who moved\nto New Jersey last year for a job. He still calls me pretty regularly to get\nthe news on the guys we used to hang out with from the neighborhood.\nThe saleswoman told me that he can save twenty percent on all the calls\nhe makes to the people on his Calling Circle list, provided that they are\nMCI-phone-company subscribers. Then she asked me if I wanted toRobert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 155\nswitch to MCI to get all the blah, blah, blah benefits of MCI service, and\nso that Brad could save twenty percent on his calls to me.\n“Well, I couldn’t have cared less about the benefits of MCI service; I\nwas perfectly happy with the long-distance company I had. But the\npart about wanting to save Brad money on our calls really got to me.\nFor me to say that I didn’t want to be in his Calling Circle and didn’t\ncare about saving him money would have sounded like a real affront\nto our friendship when he learned of it. So, to avoid insulting him, I\ntold her to switch me to MCI.\n“I used to wonder why women would go to a Tupperware party just\nbecause a friend was holding it, and then buy stuff they didn’t want\nonce they were there.

Let’s suppose\nfurther that, finding the idea of such an experiment intriguing, you\ncontact the director of the study, a Professor Stanley Milgram, and make\narrangements to participate in an hour-long session. When you arrive\nat the laboratory suite, you meet two men. One is the researcher in\ncharge of the experiment, as is clearly evidenced by the gray lab coat\nhe wears and the clipboard he carries. The other is a volunteer like\nyourself who seems average in all respects.\nAfter initial greetings and pleasantries are exchanged, the researcher\nbegins to explain the procedures to be followed. He says that the exper-\niment is a study of how punishment affects learning and memory.\nTherefore, one participant will have the task of learning pairs of words\nin a long list until each pair can be recalled perfectly; this person is to\nbe called the Learner. The other partici-pant’s job will be to test the\nLearner’s memory and to deliver increasingly strong electric shocks for\nevery mistake; this person will be designated the Teacher.\nNaturally, you get a bit nervous at this news. And your apprehension\nincreases when, after drawing lots with your partner, you find that you\nare assigned the Learner role. You hadn’t expected the possibility of\npain as part of the study, so you briefly consider leaving. But no, you\nthink, there’s plenty of time for that if need be and, besides, how strong\na shock could it be?\nAfter you have had a chance to study the list of word pairs, the re-\nsearcher straps you into a chair and, with the Teacher looking on, at-\ntaches electrodes to your arm. More worried now about the effect of\nthe shock, you inquire into its severity. The researcher’s response is\nhardly comforting; he says that although the shocks can be extremely\npainful, they will cause you “no permanent tissue damage.” With that,\nthe researcher and the Teacher leave you alone and go to the next room,\nwhere the Teacher asks you the test questions through an intercom\nsystem and delivers electric punishment for every wrong response.\nAs the test proceeds, you quickly recognize the pattern that the\nTeacher follows: He asks the question and waits for your answer over\nthe intercom. Whenever you err, he announces the voltage of the shock\nyou are about to receive and pulls a level to deliver the punishment.\nThe most troubling thing is that with each error you make, the shock\nincreases by 15 volts.\nThe first part of the test progresses smoothly. The shocks are annoying\nbut tolerable. Later on, though, as your mistakes accumulate and the\nshock voltages climb, the punishment begins to hurt enough to disrupt\nyour concentration, which leads to more errors and ever more disruptive\nshocks. At the 75-, 90-, and 105-volt levels, the pain makes you grunt\naudibly. At 120 volts, you exclaim into the intercom that the shocks are\nreally starting to hurt. You take one more punishment with a groan and\ndecide that you can’t take much more pain. After the Teacher delivers\nthe 150-volt shock, you shout back into the intercom, “That’s all! Get\nme out of here! Get me out of here, please! Let me out!”\nBut instead of the assurance you expect from the Teacher that he and\nthe researcher are coming to release you, the Teacher merely gives you\nthe next test question to answer. Surprised and confused, you mumble\nthe first answer to come into your head. It’s wrong, of course, and the\nTeacher delivers a 165-volt shock. You scream at the Teacher to stop,\nto let you out. But he responds only with the next test question—and\nwith the next slashing shock when your frenzied answer is incorrect.\nYou can’t hold down the panic any longer; the shocks are so strong\nnow they make you writhe and shriek. You kick the wall, demand to\nbe released, beg the Teacher to help you. But the test questions continue\nas before and so do the dreaded shocks—in searing jolts of 195, 210,\n225, 240, 255, 270, 285, and 300 volts. You realize that you can’t possibly\nanswer the test correctly now, so you shout to the Teacher that you\nwon’t answer his questions any longer. Nothing changes; the Teacher\ninterprets your failure to respond as an incorrect response and sends\nanother bolt. The ordeal continues in this way until, finally, the power158 / Influence\nof the shocks stuns you into near paralysis. You can no longer cry out,\nno longer struggle. You can only feel each terrible electric bite. Perhaps,\nyou think, this total inactivity will cause the Teacher to stop. There can\nbe no reason to continue this experiment. But he proceeds relentlessly,\ncalling out the test questions, announcing the horrid shock levels (about\n400 volts now), and pulling the levers. What must this man be like? you\nwonder in confusion. Why doesn’t he help me? Why won’t he stop?\nFor most of us, the above scenario reads like a bad dream. To recog-\nnize how nightmarish it is, though, we should understand that in most\nrespects it is real. There was such an experiment—actually, a whole\nseries—run by a psychology professor named Milgram in which parti-\ncipants in the Teacher role were willing to deliver continued, intense,\nand dangerous levels of shock to a kicking, screeching, pleading other\nperson. Only one major aspect of the experiment was not genuine. No\nreal shock was delivered; the Learner, the victim who repeatedly cried\nout in agony for mercy and release, was not a true subject but an actor\nwho only pretended to be shocked. The actual purpose of Milgram’s\nstudy, then, had nothing to do with the effects of punishment on\nlearning and memory. Rather, it involved an entirely different question:\nWhen it is their job, how much suffering will ordinary people be willing\nto inflict on an entirely innocent other person?\nThe answer is most unsettling. Under circumstances mirroring pre-\ncisely the features of the “bad dream,” the typical Teacher was willing\nto deliver as much pain as was available to give. Rather than yield to\nthe pleas of the victim, about two thirds of the subjects in Milgram’s\nexperiment pulled every one of the thirty shock switches in front of\nthem and continued to engage the last switch (450 volts) until the re-\nsearcher ended the experiment. More alarming still, not one of the forty\nsubjects in this study quit his job as Teacher when the victim first began\nto demand his release; nor later, when he began to beg for it; nor even\nlater, when his reaction to each shock had become, in Milgram’s words,\n“definitely an agonized scream.” Not until the 300-volt shock had been\nsent and the victim had “shouted in desperation that he would no longer\nprovide answers to the memory test” did anyone stop—and even then,\nit was a distinct minority who did.\nThese results surprised everyone associated with the project, Milgram\nincluded. In fact, before the study began, he asked groups of colleagues,\ngraduate students, and psychology majors at Yale University (where\nthe experiment was performed) to read a copy of the experimental\nprocedures and estimate how many subjects would go all the way to\nthe last (450-volt) shock. Invariably, the answers fell in the 1 to 2 percent\nrange. A separate group of thirty-nine psychiatrists predicted that onlyRobert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 159\nabout one person in a thousand would be willing to continue to the\nend. No one, then, was prepared for the behavior patterns that the ex-\nperiment actually produced.\nHow can we explain those alarming patterns? Perhaps, as some have\nargued, it has to do with the fact that the subjects were all males who\nare known as a group for their aggressive tendencies, or that the subjects\ndidn’t recognize the potential harm that such high shock voltages could\ncause, or that the subjects were a freakish collection of moral cretins\nwho enjoyed the chance to inflict misery. But there is good evidence\nagainst each of these possibilities. First, the subjects’ sex was shown by\na later experiment to be irrelevant to their willingness to give all the\nshocks to the victim; female Teachers were just as likely to do so as the\nmales in Milgram’s initial study.\nThe explanation that subjects weren’t aware of the potential physical\ndanger to the victim was also examined in a subsequent experiment\nand found to be wanting. In that version, when the victim was instructed\nto announce that he had a heart condition and to declare that his heart\nwas being affected by the shock—“That’s all. Get me out of here. I told\nyou I had heart trouble. My heart’s starting to bother me. I refuse to go\non. Let me out”—the results were the same as before; 65 percent of the\nsubjects carried out their duties faithfully through the maximum shock.\nFinally, the explanation that Milgram’s subjects were a twisted, sad-\nistic bunch not at all representative of the average citizen has proven\nunsatisfactory as well. The people who answered Milgram’s newspaper\nad to participate in his “memory” experiment represented a standard\ncross section of ages, occupations, and educational levels within our\nsociety. What’s more, later on, a battery of personality scales showed\nthese people to be quite normal psychologically, with not a hint of\npsychosis as a group. They were, in fact, just like you and me; or, as\nMilgram likes to term it, they are you and me. If he is right that his\nstudies implicate us in their grisly findings, the unanswered question\nbecomes an uncomfortably personal one: What could make us do such\nthings?\nMilgram is sure he knows the answer. It has to do, he says, with a\ndeep-seated sense of duty to authority within us all. According to Mil-\ngram, the real culprit in the experiments was his subject’s inability to\ndefy the wishes of the boss of the study—the lab-coated researcher who\nurged and, if need be, directed the subjects to perform their duties,\ndespite the emotional and physical mayhem they were causing.\nThe evidence supporting Milgram’s obedience to authority explana-\ntion is strong. First, it is clear that, without the researcher’s directives\nto continue, the subjects would have ended the experiment quickly.\nThey hated what they were doing and agonized over their victim’s160 / Influence\nagony. They implored the researcher to let them stop. When he refused,\nthey went on, but in the process they trembled, they perspired, they\nshook, they stammered protests and additional pleas for the victim’s\nrelease. Their fingernails dug into their own flesh; they bit their lips\nuntil they bled; they held their heads in their hands; some fell into fits\nof uncontrollable nervous laughter. As one outside observer to the ex-\nperiment wrote:\nI observed a mature and initially poised businessman enter the\nlaboratory smiling and confident. Within twenty minutes he was\nreduced to a twitching, stuttering wreck who was rapidly approach-\ning a point of nervous collapse. He constantly pulled on his earlobe\nand twisted his hands. At one point he pushed his fist into his\nforehead and muttered: “Oh, God, let’s stop it.” And yet he con-\ntinued to respond to every word of the experimenter and obeyed\nto the end.1\nIn addition to these observations, Milgram has provided even more\nconvincing evidence for the obedience-to-authority interpretation of\nhis subjects’ behavior. In a later study, for instance, he had the researcher\nand the victim switch scripts so that the researcher told the Teacher to\nstop delivering shocks to the victim, while the victim insisted bravely\nthat the Teacher continue. The result couldn’t have been clearer; 100\npercent of the subjects refused to give one additional shock when it was\nmerely the fellow subject who demanded it. The identical finding ap-\npeared in another version of the experiment in which the researcher\nand fellow subject switched roles so that it was the researcher who was\nstrapped into the chair and the fellow subject who ordered the Teacher\nto continue—over the protests of the researcher. Again, not one subject\ntouched another shock lever.\nThe extreme degree to which subjects in Milgram’s situation were\nattentive to the wishes of authority was documented in yet another\nvariation of the basic study. In this case, Milgram presented the\nTeacher with two researchers, who issued contradictory orders; one\nordered the Teacher to terminate the shocks when the victim cried out\nfor release, while the other maintained that the experiment should go\non. These conflicting instructions reliably produced what may have\nbeen the project’s only humor: In tragicomic befuddlement and with\neyes darting from one researcher to another, subjects would beseech\nthe pair to agree on a single command they could follow: “Wait, wait.\nWhich is it going to be? One says stop, one says go. Which is it!?” When\nthe researchers remained at loggerheads, the subjects tried frantically\nto determine who was the bigger boss. Failing this route to obedience\nwith the authority, every subject finally followed his better instincts andRobert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 161\nended the shocks. As in the other experimental variations, such a result\nwould hardly be expected had the subjects’ motivations involved some\nform of sadism or neurotic aggressiveness.2\nTo Milgram’s mind, evidence of a chilling phenomenon emerges re-\npeatedly from his accumulated data: “It is the extreme willingness of\nadults to go to almost any lengths on the command of an authority that\nconstitutes the chief finding of the study.” There are sobering implica-\ntions of this finding for those concerned about the ability of another\nform of authority—government—to extract frightening levels of obed-\nience from ordinary citizens.3 Furthermore, the finding tells us some-\nthing about the sheer strength of authority pressures in controlling our\nbehavior. After witnessing Milgram’s subjects squirming and sweating\nand suffering at their task, could anyone doubt the power of the force\nthat held them there?\nFor those whose doubts remain, the story of S. Brian Willson might\nprove instructive. On September 1, 1987, to protest U.S. shipments of\nmilitary equipment to Nicaragua, Mr. Willson and two other men\nstretched their bodies across the railroad tracks leading out of the\nConcord, California, Naval Weapons Station. The protesters were con-\nfident that their act would halt the scheduled train’s progress that day,\nas they had notified Navy and railroad officials of their intent three\ndays before. But the civilian crew, which had been given orders not to\nstop, never even slowed the train, despite being able to see the protesters\nsix hundred feet ahead. Although two of the men managed to scramble\nout of harm’s way, Mr. Willson was not quick enough to avoid being\nstruck and having both legs severed below the knee. Because Navy\nmedical corpsmen at the scene refused to treat him or allow him to be\ntaken to the hospital in their ambulance, onlookers—including Mr.\nWillson’s wife and son—were left to try to stanch the flow of blood for\nforty-five minutes until a private ambulance arrived.\nAmazingly, Mr. Willson, who served four years in Vietnam, does not\nblame either the crewmen or the corpsmen for his misfortune; he points\nhis finger, instead, at a system that constrained their actions through\nthe pressure to obey: “They were just doing what I did in ’Nam. They\nwere following orders that are part of an insane policy. They’re the fall\nguys.” Although the crew members shared Mr. Willson’s assessment\nof them as victims, they did not share his magnanimity. In what is\nperhaps the most remarkable aspect of the incident, the train crew filed\nsuit against him, requesting punitive damages for the “humiliation,\nmental anguish, and physical stress” they suffered because he hadn’t\nallowed them to carry out their orders without cutting off his legs.\nWhenever we are faced with so potent a motivator of human action,162 / Influence\nit is natural to expect that good reasons exist for the motivation. In the\ncase of obedience to authority, even a brief consideration of human social\norganization offers justification aplenty. A multilayered and widely\naccepted system of authority confers an immense advantage upon a\nsociety. It allows the development of sophisticated structures for re-\nsource production, trade, defense, expansion, and social control that\nwould otherwise be impossible. The other alternative, anarchy, is a state\nthat is hardly known for its beneficial effects on cultural groups and\none that the social philosopher Thomas Hobbes assures us would render\nlife “solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.” Consequently, we are\ntrained from birth that obedience to proper authority is right and dis-\nobedience is wrong. The essential message fills the parental lessons,\nthe schoolhouse rhymes, stories, and songs of our childhood and is\ncarried forward in the legal, military, and political systems we encounter\nas adults. Notions of submission and loyalty to legitimate rule are ac-\ncorded much value in each.\nReligious instruction contributes as well. The very first book of the\nBible, for example, describes how failure to obey the ultimate authority\nproduced the loss of paradise for Adam, Eve, and the rest of the human\nrace. Should that particular metaphor prove too subtle, just a bit further\ninto the Old Testament we can read—in what might be the closest bib-\nlical representation of the Milgram experiment—the respectful account\nof Abraham’s willingness to plunge a dagger through the heart of his\nyoung son, because God, without any explanation, ordered it. We learn\nit this story that the correctness of an action was not adjudged by such\nconsiderations as apparent senselessness, harmfulness, injustice, or\nusual moral standards, but by the mere command of a higher authority.\nAbraham’s tormented ordeal was a test of obedience, and he—like\nMilgram’s subjects, who perhaps had learned an early lesson from\nhim—passed.\nStories like those of Abraham and Milgram’s subjects can tell us much\nabout the power of and value for obedience in our culture. In another\nsense, however, they may be misleading as to the way obedience typic-\nally occurs. We rarely agonize to such a degree over the pros and cons\nof authority’s demands. In fact, our obedience frequently takes place\nin a click, whirr fashion, with little or no conscious deliberation. Inform-\nation from a recognized authority can provide us a valuable shortcut\nfor deciding how to act in a situation.\nAfter all, as Milgram himself suggests, conforming to the dictates of\nauthority figures has always had genuine practical advantages for us.\nEarly on, these people (for example, parents, teachers) knew more than\nwe did, and we found that taking their advice proved beneficial—partly\nbecause of their greater wisdom and partly because they controlled ourRobert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 163\nrewards and punishments. As adults, the same benefits persist for the\nsame reasons, though the authority figures now appear as employers,\njudges, and government leaders. Because their positions speak of super-\nior access to information and power, it makes great sense to comply\nwith the wishes of properly constituted authorities. It makes so much\nsense, in fact, that we often do so when it makes no sense at all.\nThis paradox is, of course, the same one that attends all major\nweapons of influence. In this instance, once we realize that obedience\nto authority is mostly rewarding, it is easy to allow ourselves the con-\nvenience of automatic obedience. The simultaneous blessing and bane\nof such blind obedience is its mechanical character. We don’t have to\nthink; therefore, we don’t. Although such mindless obedience leads us\nto appropriate action in the great majority of cases, there will be con-\nspicuous exceptions—because we are reacting rather than thinking.\nLet’s take an example from one facet of our lives where authority\npressures are visible and strong: medicine. Health is enormously im-\nportant to us. Thus, physicians, who possess large amounts of know-\nledge and influence in this vital area, hold the position of respected\nauthorities. In addition, the medical establishment has a clearly terraced\npower and prestige structure. The various kinds of health workers well\nunderstand the level of their jobs in this structure; and they well under-\nstand, too, that the M.D. sits at the top. No one may overrule the doctor’s\njudgment in a case, except perhaps, another doctor of higher rank. As\na consequence, a long-established tradition of automatic obedience to\na doctor’s orders has developed among health-care staffs.\nThe worrisome possibility arises, then, that when a physician makes\na clear error, no one lower in the hierarchy will think to question\nit—precisely because, once a legitimate authority has given an order,\nsubordinates stop thinking in the situation and start reacting. Mix this\nkind of click, whirr response into a complex hospital environment and\nmistakes are certain. Indeed a study done in the early 1980s by the U.S.\nHealth Care Financing Administration showed that, for patient medic-\nation alone, the average hospital had a 12 percent daily error rate. A\ndecade later, things had not improved: According to a Harvard Univer-\nsity study, 10 percent of all cardiac arrests in hospitals are attributable\nto medication errors. Errors in the medicine patients receive can occur\nfor a variety of reasons. However, a book entitled Medication Errors:\nCauses and Prevention by two Temple University pharmacology profess-\nors, Michael Cohen and Neil Davis, attributes much of the problem to\nthe mindless deference given the “boss” of the patient’s case: the attend-\ning physician. According to Professor Cohen, “in case after case, patients,\nnurses, pharmacists, and other physicians do not question the prescrip-\ntion.” Take, for example, the strange case of the “rectal earache” reported164 / Influence\nby Cohen and Davis. A physician ordered ear drops to be administered\nto the right ear of a patient suffering pain and infection there. But instead\nof writing out completely the location “right ear” on the prescription,\nthe doctor abbreviated it so that the instructions read “place in R ear.”\nUpon receiving the prescription, the duty nurse promptly put the re-\nquired number of ear drops into the patient’s anus.\nObviously, rectal treatment of an earache made no sense. Yet neither\nthe patient nor the nurse questioned it. The important lesson of this\nstory is that in many situations where a legitimate authority has spoken,\nwhat would otherwise make sense is irrelevant. In these instances, we\ndon’t consider the situation as a whole but attend and respond to only\none aspect of it.4\nWherever our behaviors are governed in such an unthinking manner,\nwe can be confident that there will be compliance professionals trying\nto take advantage. We can stay within the field of medicine and see that\nadvertisers have frequently harnessed the respect accorded to doctors\nin our culture by hiring actors to play the roles of doctors speaking on\nbehalf of the product. My favorite example is a TV commercial featuring\nactor Robert Young counseling people against the dangers of caffeine\nand recommending caffeine-free Sanka Brand coffee. The commercial\nwas highly successful, selling so much coffee that it was played for\nyears in several versions. But why should this commercial prove so ef-\nfective? Why on earth would we take Robert Young’s word for the\nhealth consequences of decaffeinated coffee? Because—as the advertising\nagency that hired him knew perfectly well—he is associated in the\nminds of the American public with Marcus Welby, M.D., the role he\nplayed in an earlier long-running television series. Objectively it doesn’t\nmake sense to be swayed by the comments of a man we know to be just\nan actor who used to play a doctor. But, as a practical matter, that man\nmoved the Sanka.\nCONNOTATION, NOT CONTENT\nFrom the first time I saw it, the most intriguing feature for me in the\nRobert Young Sanka commercial was its ability to use the influence of\nthe authority principle without ever providing a real authority. The\nappearance of authority was enough. This tells us something important\nabout unthinking reactions to authority figures. When in a click, whirr\nmode, we are often as vulnerable to the symbols of authority as to the\nsubstance.\nThere are several kinds of symbols that can reliably trigger our com-\npliance in the absence of the genuine substance of authority. Con-\nsequently, they are employed extensively by those compliance profes-Robert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 165\nsionals who are short on substance. Con artists, for example, drape\nthemselves with the titles, clothes, and trappings of authority. They\nlove nothing more than to emerge elegantly dressed from a fine auto-\nmobile and to introduce themselves to their prospective “mark” as\nDoctor or Judge or Professor or Commissioner Someone. They under-\nstand that when they are so equipped, their chances for compliance are\ngreatly increased. Each of these three types of symbols of authority has\nits own story and is worth a separate look.\nTitles\nTitles are simultaneously the most difficult and the easiest symbols of\nauthority to acquire. To earn one normally takes years of work and\nachievement. Yet it is possible for somebody who has put in none of\nthis effort to adopt the mere label and receive a kind of automatic defer-\nence. As we have seen, TV-commercial actors and con artists do it suc-\ncessfully all the time.\nI recently talked with a friend—a faculty member at a well-known\neastern university—who provided a telling illustration of how our ac-\ntions are frequently more influenced by a title than by the nature of the\nperson claiming it. My friend travels quite a bit and often finds himself\nchatting with strangers in bars, restaurants, and airports. He says that\nhe has learned through much experience never to use his title—profess-\nor—during these conversations. When he does, he reports, the tenor of\nthe interaction changes immediately. People who have been spontaneous\nand interesting conversation partners for the prior half hour become\nrespectful, accepting, and dull. His opinions that earlier might have\nproduced a lively exchange now usually generate extended (and highly\ngrammatical) statements of accord. Annoyed and slightly bewildered\nby the phenomenon—because, as he says, “I’m still the same guy they’ve\nbeen talking to for the past thirty minutes, right?”—my friend now\nregularly lies about his occupation in such situations.\nWhat a refreshing shift from the more typical pattern in which certain\ncompliance practitioners lie about titles they don’t truly have. In either\ndirection, however, such practiced dishonesty makes the same point\nabout the sufficiency of a mere symbol of authority to influence behavi-\nor.\nI wonder whether my professor friend—who is physically somewhat\nshort—would be so eager to hide his title if he knew that, besides\nmaking strangers more accommodating, it also makes them see him as\ntaller. Studies investigating the way in which authority status affects\nperceptions of size have found that prestigious titles lead to height\ndistortions. In one experiment conducted on five classes of Australian166 / Influence\ncollege students, a man was introduced as a visitor from Cambridge\nUniversity in England. However, his status at Cambridge was repres-\nented differently in each of the classes. To one class, he was presented\nas a student; to a second class, a demonstrator; to another, a lecturer;\nto yet another, a senior lecturer; to a fifth, a professor. After he left the\nroom, each class was asked to estimate his height. It was found that\nwith each increase in status, the same man grew in perceived height by\nan average of a half inch, so that as the “professor” he was seen as two\nand a half inches taller than as the “student.”5\nIt is worth the time of a small detour to pursue this interesting con-\nnection between status and perceived size, since it shows up in a variety\nof ways. In judging the size of coins, for example, children most overes-\ntimate the size of the more valuable coins. And adults are just as guilty\nof such distortions. In one study, college students drew cards that had\nmonetary values printed on them ranging from $3.00 to –$3.00; they\nwon or lost the amount shown on the cards they picked. Afterward,\nthey were asked to rate the size of each card. Even though all cards\nwere exactly the same size, those that had the more extreme values—pos-\nitive or negative—were seen as physically larger. Thus it is not neces-\nsarily the pleasantness of a thing that makes it seem bigger to us, it is\nits importance.6\nBecause we see size and status as related, it is possible for certain in-\ndividuals to benefit by substituting the former for the latter. In some\nanimal societies, where the status of a male is assigned on the basis of\ndominance, size is an important factor in determining which male will\nachieve which status level in the group.7 Usually, in combat with a\nrival, the larger and more powerful male wins. To avoid the harmful\neffects to the group of such physical conflict, however, many species\nhave adopted methods that frequently involve more form than fracas.\nThe two males confront each other with showy aggression displays that\ninvariably include size-enhancing tricks. Various mammals arch their\nbacks and bristle their coats; fish extend their fins and puff themselves\nup with water; birds unfurl and flutter their wings. Very often, this ex-\nhibition alone is enough to send one of the histrionic warriors into re-\ntreat, leaving the contested status position to his seemingly larger and\nstronger rival.\nFur, fins, and feathers. Isn’t it interesting how these most delicate of\nparts can be exploited to give the impression of substance and weight?\nThere are two lessons for us here. One is specific to the association\nbetween size and status. The connection of those two things can be\nprofitably employed by individuals who are able to fake the first to\ngain the appearance of the second. This is precisely why con men, evenRobert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 167\nthose of average or slightly above-average height, commonly wear lifts\nin their shoes.\nThe other lesson is more general: The outward signs of power and\nauthority frequently may be counterfeited with the flimsiest of materials.\nLet’s return to the realm of titles for an example—an example that in-\nvolves what, in several ways, is the scariest experiment I know. A group\nof researchers, composed of doctors and nurses with connections to\nthree midwestern hospitals, became increasingly concerned with the\nextent of mechanical obedience to doctors’ orders on the part of nurses.\nIt seemed to the researchers that even highly trained and skilled nurses\nwere not using that training or skill sufficiently to check on a doctor’s\njudgment; instead, when confronted with a physician’s directives, they\nwould simply defer.\nEarlier, we saw how this process accounted for the case of the rectally\nadministered ear drops. But the midwestern researchers took things\nseveral steps further. First, they wanted to find out whether such cases\nwere isolated incidents or representative of a widespread phenomenon.\nSecond, they wanted to examine the problem in the context of a serious\ntreatment error—the gross overprescription of an unauthorized drug\nto a hospital patient. Finally, they wanted to see what would happen\nif they physically removed the authority figure from the situation and\nsubstituted an unfamiliar voice on the phone, offering only the frailest\nevidence of authority—the claimed title “doctor.”\nTo twenty-two separate nurses’ stations on various surgical, medical,\npediatric, and psychiatric wards, one of the researchers made an\nidentical phone call in which he identified himself as a hospital physician\nand directed the answering nurse to give twenty milligrams of a drug\n(Astrogen) to a specific ward patient. There were four excellent reasons\nfor a nurse’s caution in response to this order: (1) The prescription was\ntransmitted by phone, in direct violation of hospital policy. (2) The\nmedication itself was unauthorized; Astrogen had not been cleared for\nuse nor placed on the ward stock list. (3) The prescribed dosage was\nobviously and dangerously excessive. The medication containers clearly\nstated that the “maximum daily dose” was only ten milligrams, half of\nwhat had been ordered. (4) The directive was given by a man the nurse\nhad never met, seen, or even talked with before on the phone. Yet, in\n95 percent of the instances, the nurses went straightaway to the ward\nmedicine cabinet, where they secured the ordered dosage of Astrogen\nand started for the patient’s room to administer it. It was at this point\nthat they were stopped by a secret observer, who revealed the nature\nof the experiment.\nThe results are frightening, indeed. That 95 percent of regular staff\nnurses complied unhesitatingly with a patently improper instruction168 / Influence\nof this sort must give us all great reason for concern as potential hospital\npatients. Given the recent U.S. Health Care Financing Administration\nestimate of a 12 percent daily-medication error rate in American hospit-\nals, stays of longer than a week make it likely that we will be recipients\nof such an error. What the midwestern study shows is that the mistakes\nare hardly limited to trivial slips in the administration of harmless ear\ndrops or the like, but extend to grave and dangerous blunders.\nIn interpreting their unsettling findings, the researchers came to an\ninstructive conclusion:\nIn a real-life situation corresponding to the experimental one, there\nwould, in theory, be two professional intelligences, the doctor’s\nand the nurse’s, working to ensure that a given procedure be un-\ndertaken in a manner beneficial to the patient or, at the very least,\nnot detrimental to him. The experiment strongly suggests, how-\never, that one of these intelligences is, for all practical purposes,\nnonfunctioning.8\nIt seems that, in the face of a physician’s directives, the nurses un-\nhooked their “professional intelligences” and moved to a click, whirr\nform of responding. None of their considerable medical training or\nknowledge was engaged in the decision of what to do. Instead, because\nobedience to legitimate authority had always been the most preferred\nand efficient action in their work setting, they had become willing to\nerr on the side of automatic obedience. It is all the more instructive that\nthey had traveled so far in this direction that their error had come not\nin response to genuine authority but to its most easily falsified sym-\nbol—a bare title.9\nClothes\nA second kind of authority symbol that can trigger our mechanical\ncompliance is clothing. Though more tangible than a title, the cloak of\nauthority is every bit as fakable. Police bunco files bulge with records\nof con artists whose artistry includes the quick change. In chameleon\nstyle, they adopt the hospital white, priestly black, army green, or police\nblue that the situation requires for maximum advantage. Only too late\ndo their victims realize that the garb of authority is hardly its guarantee.\nA series of studies by social psychologist Leonard Bickman gives an\nindication of how difficult it can be to resist requests that come from\nfigures in authority attire. Bickman’s basic procedure was to ask pass-\nersby on the street to comply with some sort of odd request (to pick up\na discarded paper bag, to stand on the other side of a bus-stop sign). In\nhalf of the instances, the requester—a young man—was dressed inRobert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 169\nnormal street clothes; the rest of the time, he was dressed in a security\nguard’s uniform. Regardless of the type of request, many more people\nobeyed the requester when he wore the guard costume.\nEspecially revealing was one version of the experiment in which the\nrequester stopped pedestrians and pointed to a man standing by a\nparking meter fifty feet away. The requester, whether dressed normally\nor as a security guard, always said the same thing to the pedestrian:\n“You see that guy over there by the meter? He’s overparked but doesn’t\nhave any change. Give him a dime!” The requester then turned a corner\nand walked away so that by the time the pedestrian reached the meter,\nthe requester was out of sight. The power of his uniform lasted, how-\never, even after he was long gone: Nearly all the pedestrians complied\nwith his directive when he had worn the guard costume, but fewer than\nhalf did so when he had dressed normally. It is interesting to note that\nlater on, Bickman found college students able to guess with considerable\naccuracy the percentage of compliance that had occurred in the experi-\nment when the requester wore street clothes (50 percent vs. the actual\n42 percent); yet the students greatly underestimated the percentage of\ncompliance when he was in uniform (63 percent vs. the actual 92 per-\ncent).10\nLess blatant in its connotation than a uniform, but nonetheless effect-\nive, is another kind of attire that has traditionally bespoken authority\nstatus in our culture: the well-tailored business suit. It, too, can evoke\na telling form of deference from total strangers. Research conducted in\nTexas, for instance, arranged for a thirty-one-year-old man to violate\nthe law by crossing the street against the traffic light on a variety of\noccasions. In half of the cases, he was dressed in a freshly pressed\nbusiness suit and tie; on the other occasions, he wore a work shirt and\ntrousers. The researchers watched from a distance and counted the\nnumber of pedestrians waiting at the corner who followed the man\nacross the street. Like the children of Hamelin who crowded after the\nPied Piper, three and a half times as many people swept into traffic\nbehind the suited jaywalker. In this case, though, the magic came not\nfrom his pipe but his pinstripes.11\nIt is noteworthy that the two types of authority apparel shown by\nthe above research to be influential—the guard uniform and business\nsuit—are combined deftly by confidence men in a fraud called the bank-\nexaminer scheme. The target of the swindle can be anyone, but elderly\npersons living alone are preferred. The con begins when a man dressed\nin a properly conservative three-piece business suit appears at the door\nof a likely victim. Everything about his clothing sends a message of\npropriety and respectability. The white shirt is starched; the wing-tip\nshoes glow deeply. His suit is not trendy but classic: The lapels are three170 / Influence\ninches wide—no more, no less; the cloth is heavy and substantial, even\nin July; the tones are muted, business blue, business gray, business\nblack.\nHe explains to his intended victim—perhaps a widow he secretly\nfollowed home from the bank a day or two earlier—that he is a profes-\nsional bank examiner who, in the course of auditing the books of her\nbank, has found some seeming irregularities. He thinks he has spotted\nthe culprit, a bank officer who is regularly doctoring reports of transac-\ntions in certain accounts. He says that the widow’s account may be one\nof these, but he can’t be sure until he has hard evidence. Therefore, he\nhas come to ask for her cooperation. Would she help out by withdrawing\nher savings so a team of examiners and responsible bank officials can\ntrace the record of the transaction as it passes across the suspect’s desk?\nOften the appearance and presentation of the “bank examiner” are\nso impressive that the victim never thinks to check on their validity\nwith even a simple phone call. Instead, she drives to the bank, with-\ndraws all her money, and returns home with it to wait with the “exam-\niner” for word on the success of the trap. When the message comes, it\nis delivered by a uniformed bank guard, who arrives after closing hours\nto announce that all is well—apparently the widow’s account was not\none of those being tampered with. Greatly relieved, the “examiner”\noffers gracious thanks and, since the bank is now conveniently closed,\ninstructs the guard to return the lady’s money to the vault, to save her\nthe trouble of doing so the next day. With smiles and handshakes all\naround, the guard takes the funds and leaves the “examiner” to express\na few more minutes of thanks before he, too, exits. Naturally, as the\nvictim eventually discovers, the “guard” is no more a guard than the\n“examiner” is an examiner. What they are is a pair of bunco artists who\nhave recognized the capacity of carefully counterfeited uniforms to\nclick us into mesmerized compliance with “authority.”\nTrappings\nAside from its function in uniforms, clothing can symbolize a more\ngeneralized type of authority when it serves an ornamental purpose.\nFinely styled and expensive clothes carry an aura of status and position,\nas do trappings such as jewelry and cars. The last of these status symbols\nis particularly interesting in the United States, where “the American\nlove affair with the automobile” gives it unusual significance.\nAccording to the findings of a study done in the San Francisco Bay\narea, owners of prestige autos receive a special kind of deference from\nus. The experimenters discovered that motorists would wait significantly\nlonger before honking their horns at a new, luxury car stopped in frontRobert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 171\nof a green traffic light than at an older, economy model. The motorists\nhad little patience with the economy-car driver: Nearly all sounded\ntheir horns, and the majority of these did so more than once; two simply\nrammed into his rear bumper. So intimidating was the aura of the\nprestige automobile, however, that 50 percent of the motorists waited\nrespectfully behind it, never touching their horns, until it drove on.12\nLater on, the researchers asked college students what they would\nhave done in such situations. Compared to the true findings of the ex-\nperiment, the students consistently underestimated the time it would\ntake them to honk at the luxury car. The male students were especially\ninaccurate, feeling that they would honk faster at the prestige- than the\neconomy-car driver; of course, the study itself showed just the opposite.\nNote the similarity of this pattern to much other research on authority\npressures. As in Milgram’s research, the midwestern hospital-nurses’\nstudy, and the security-guard-uniform experiment, people were unable\nto predict correctly how they or others would react to authority influ-\nence. In each instance, the effect of such influence was grossly underes-\ntimated. This property of authority status may account for much of its\nsuccess as a compliance device. Not only does it work forcefully on us,\nbut it also does so unexpectedly.\nHOW TO SAY NO\nOne protective tactic we can use against authority status is to remove\nits element of surprise. Because we typically misperceive the profound\nimpact of authority (and its symbols) on our actions, we are at the dis-\nadvantage of being insufficiently cautious about its presence in compli-\nance situations. A fundamental form of defense against this problem,\ntherefore, is a heightened awareness of authority power. When this\nawareness is coupled with a recognition of how easily authority symbols\ncan be faked, the benefit will be a properly guarded approach to situ-\nations involving authority-influence attempts.\nSounds simple, right? And in a way it is. A better understanding of\nthe workings of authority influence should help us resist it. Yet there\nis a perverse complication—the familiar one inherent in all weapons of\ninfluence: We shouldn’t want to resist altogether, or even most of the\ntime. Generally, authority figures know what they are talking about.\nPhysicians, judges, corporate executives, legislative leaders, and the\nlike have typically gained their positions because of superior knowledge\nand judgment. Thus, as a rule, their directives offer excellent counsel.\nThe trick is to be able to recognize without much strain or vigilance\nwhen authority promptings are best followed and when they should\nbe resisted.172 / Influence\nPosing two questions to ourselves can help enormously to accomplish\nthis trick. The first is to ask, when we are confronted with what appears\nto be an authority figure’s influence attempt, “Is this authority truly an\nexpert?” The question is helpful because it focuses our attention on a\npair of crucial pieces of information: the authority’s credentials and the\nrelevance of those credentials to the topic at hand. By orienting in this\nsimple way toward the evidence for authority status, we can avoid the\nmajor pitfalls of automatic deference. An illustration or two is in order.\nLet’s examine the highly successful Robert Young Sanka-coffee\ncommercial in this light. If, rather than responding to his “Marcus\nWelby, M.D.” association, people had focused on Mr. Young’s actual\nstatus as an authority, I am confident that the commercial would not\nhave had so long and productive a run. Obviously, Robert Young does\nnot possess a physician’s training or knowledge. We all know that.\nWhat he does possess, however, is a physician’s title, “M.D.” Now,\nclearly, it is an empty title, connected to him in our minds through the\ndevice of playacting. We all know that, too. But isn’t it fascinating how,\nwhen we are whirring along, what is obvious often doesn’t matter unless\nwe pay specific attention to it?\nThat is why the “Is this authority truly an expert?” question can be\nso valuable: It brings our attention to the obvious. It channels us effort-\nlessly away from a focus on possibly meaningless symbols to a consid-\neration of genuine authority credentials. What’s more, the question\nimpels us to distinguish between relevant authorities and irrelevant\nauthorities. And this is a distinction that is easy to forget when the push\nof authority pressure is combined with the rush of modern life. The\nTexas pedestrians who bustled into city traffic behind a business-suited\njaywalker offer a prime example. Even if the man had been the business\nauthority his clothes suggested he might be, he was unlikely to be a\ngreater authority on crossing the street than other people, including\nthose who followed him into traffic.\nStill, they did follow, as if his label, “authority,” overwhelmed the\nvital difference between relevant and irrelevant forms. Had they\nbothered to ask themselves whether he represented a true expert in the\nsituation, someone whose actions reflected superior knowledge there,\nI expect the result would have been quite different. The same process\napplies to Robert Young, a man who is not without expertise. He has\nfashioned a long career with many achievements in a difficult business.\nBut his skills and knowledge are as an actor, not a doctor. When, in\nviewing the famous coffee commercial, we focus on his true credentials,\nwe will realize quickly that he should be no more believed than any\nother successful actor who claims that Sanka is healthy.Robert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 173\nSuppose, though, we are confronted with an authority we determine\nis a relevant expert. Before submitting to authority influence, it would\nbe wise to ask a second simple question: “How truthful can we expect\nthe expert to be here?” Authorities, even the best informed, may not\npresent their information honestly to us. Therefore we need to consider\ntheir trustworthiness in the situation. In fact, most of the time, we do.\nWe allow ourselves to be much more swayed by experts who seem to\nbe impartial than by those who have something to gain by convincing\nus; and this has been shown by research to be true around the world.13\nBy wondering how an expert stands to benefit from our compliance,\nwe give ourselves another safety net against undue and automatic in-\nfluence. Even knowledgeable authorities in a field will not persuade\nus until we are satisfied that their messages represent the facts faithfully.\nWhen asking ourselves about such a person’s trustworthiness, we\nshould keep in mind a little tactic compliance practitioners often use\nto assure us of their sincerity: They will seem to argue to a degree against\ntheir own interests. Correctly done, this can be a subtly effective device\nfor proving their honesty. Perhaps they will mention a small shortcom-\ning in their position or product (“Oh, the disadvantages of Benson &\nHedges”). Invariably, though, the drawback will be a secondary one\nthat is easily overcome by more significant advantages—“Listerine, the\ntaste you hate three times a day”; “Avis: We’re number two, but we try\nharder”; “L’Oréal, a bit more expensive and worth it.” By establishing\ntheir basic truthfulness on minor issues, the compliance professionals\nwho use this ploy can then be more believable when stressing the im-\nportant aspects of their argument.14\nI have seen this approach used with devastating effect in a place that\nfew of us recognize as a compliance setting: the restaurant. It is no secret\nthat because of shamelessly low wages, servers in restaurants must\nsupplement their earnings with tips. Leaving the sine qua non of good\nservice aside, the most successful waiters and waitresses know certain\ntricks for increasing tips. They also know that the larger a customer’s\nbill, the larger the amount of money likely to come to them in a standard\ngratuity. In these two regards, then—building the size of the customer’s\ncharge and building the percentage of that charge that is given as a\ntip—servers regularly act as compliance agents.\nHoping to find out how they operate, I applied for waiter openings\nat several fairly expensive restaurants. Without experience, though, the\nbest I could do was to land a busboy job that, as things turned out,\nprovided me a propitious vantage point from which to watch and\nanalyze the action. Before long, I realized what the other employees\nalready knew—that the most successful waiter in the place was Vincent,174 / Influence\nwho somehow arranged for patrons to order more and tip higher than\nfor anyone else; in fact, the other servers were not even close to him in\nweekly earnings.\nSo I began to linger in my duties around Vincent’s tables to observe\nhis style. I quickly learned that his style was to have no single style. He\nhad a repertoire of them, each ready to be called on under the appropri-\nate circumstances. When the customers were a family, he was efferves-\ncent—even slightly clownish—directing his remarks as often to the\nchildren as to the adults. With a young couple on a date, he became\nformal and a bit imperious in an attempt to intimidate the young man\n(to whom he spoke exclusively) into ordering and tipping lavishly.\nWith an older, married couple, he retained the formality but dropped\nthe superior air in favor of a respectful orientation to both members of\nthe couple. Should the patron be dining alone, Vincent selected a\nfriendly demeanor—cordial, conversational, and warm.\nBut Vincent reserved the trick of seeming to argue against his own\ninterests for large parties of eight to twelve people. Here his technique\nwas veined with genius. When it was time for the first person, normally\na lady, to order, he went into his act. No matter what she selected,\nVincent reacted identically: His brow furrowed, his hand hovered above\nhis order pad, and after looking quickly over his shoulder for the\nmanager, he leaned conspiratorially toward the table to report for all\nto hear, “I’m afraid that is not as good tonight as it normally is. Might\nI recommend instead the____or the____?” (Here Vincent suggested a\npair of menu items that were fifty cents or so less expensive than the\ndish the patron had selected initially.) “They are both excellent tonight.”\nWith this single maneuver, Vincent engaged several important prin-\nciples of influence. First, even those who did not take his suggestions\nfelt that Vincent had done them a favor by offering valuable information\nto help them order. Everyone felt grateful, and consequently the rule\nfor reciprocity would work in his favor when it came time to decide on\nhis gratuity. But besides hiking the percentage of his tip, Vincent’s\nmaneuver also placed him in a favorable position to increase the size\nof the table’s order. It established him as an authority on the current\nstores of the house; he clearly knew what was and wasn’t good that\nnight. Moreover—and this is where seeming to argue against his own\ninterests came in—it proved him to be a trustworthy informant, because\nhe recommended dishes that were slightly less expensive than originally\nordered. Rather than trying to line his own pockets, he seemed to have\nthe customers’ best interests at heart.\nTo all appearances, he was at once knowledgeable and honest, a\ncombination that gave him great credibility. And Vincent was quick to\nexploit the advantage of this credible image. When the party had fin-Robert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 175\nished giving their food orders, he would say, “Very well, and would\nyou like me to suggest or select some wine to go with your meals?” As\nI watched the scene repeated almost nightly, there was a notable con-\nsistency to the customers’ reactions—smiles, nods, and for the most\npart, general assent.\nEven from the distance of my vantage point, one could read their\nthoughts from their faces. “Sure,” they seemed to say, “you know what’s\ngood here, and you’re obviously on our side. Tell us what to get.”\nLooking pleased, Vincent, who did know his vintages, would respond\nwith some excellent (and costly) choices. He was similarly persuasive\nwhen it came time for dessert decisions. Patrons who otherwise would\nhave passed up the dessert course or shared with a friend were swayed\nto partake fully by Vincent’s rapturous descriptions of the Baked Alaska\nand chocolate mousse. Who, after all, is more believable than a demon-\nstrated expert of proven sincerity?\nBy combining the factors of reciprocity and credible authority into a\nsingle, elegant maneuver, Vincent was able to inflate substantially both\nthe percentage of his tip and the base charge on which it was figured.\nHis proceeds from this trick were handsome, indeed. But notice that\nmuch of his profit came from an apparent lack of concern for personal\nprofit. Seeming to argue against his financial interests served those in-\nterests extremely well.\nREADER’S REPORT\nFrom a Young Businessman\n“About two years ago, I was trying to sell my old car because I’d already\nbought a new one. One day I passed a used-car lot with a sign reading,\nWE WILL SELL YOUR CAR FOR MORE. Just what I wanted, I thought; so I\nstopped in to talk with the owner. I told him I wanted to get about three\nthousand dollars for my old car, and he said he thought I should be\nasking for a lot more because it was worth at least thirty-five-hundred\ndollars. This came as a real surprise to me, because the way their con-\nsignment system worked, the larger my asking price for the car, the\nless money was left over for them to keep after they sold it to somebody.\nTherefore, by telling me to ask for more than three thousand dollars,\nthey were cutting off their own profits. Just like your Vincent-the-waiter\nexample, they were seeming to argue against their own interests so I’d\nsee them as trustworthy authorities; but I didn’t realize this until much\nlater. Anyway, I went along with the owner’s idea that my car was\nworth more than I’d first thought, and I set my asking price at thirty-\nfive-hundred dollars.\n“After they’d had my car on their lot for a couple of days, they called176 / Influence\nsaying that someone was really interested in it, but that the price was\na little too high. Would I be willing to drop my price by two hundred\ndollars to sell the car? Convinced that they had my interests at heart, I\nagreed. The next day they called back to say the the buyer’s financing\nhad fallen through and that he couldn’t buy the car. In the next two\nweeks, I got two more calls from the dealership, each asking me to drop\nmy price two hundred dollars to seal a sale to some customer. Both\ntimes I OK’d it because I still believed they were trustworthy. But each\ntime, the alleged deal fell through. I was suspicious enough to call a\nfriend whose family was in the car business. He said this was an old\ntrick designed to get sellers like me to reduce their asking prices to super\nlow levels, giving the dealership big profits when they finally sold the\ncar.\n“So, I went over there and took my car. As I was leaving, they were\nstill trying to persuade me to let them keep it because they had a ‘hot\nprospect’ who they were sure would buy it if I’d only knock off another\ntwo hundred dollars.”\nOnce again in a Reader’s Report we can see the influence of the contrast\nprinciple combining with the principle of primary interest. In this case,\nafter the thirty-five-hundred-dollar figure was set, each\ntwo-hundred-dollar nick seemed small by comparison.Robert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 177\nChapter 7\nSCARCITY\nThe Rule of the Few\nThe way to love anything is to realize that it might be lost.\n—G. K. CHESTERTON\nTHE CITY OF MESA, ARIZONA, IS A SUBURB IN THE PHOENIX AREA where\nI live. Perhaps the most notable features of Mesa are its sizable\nMormon population—next to that of Salt Lake City, the largest in the\nworld—and a huge Mormon temple located on exquisitely kept grounds\nin the center of the city. Although I had appreciated the landscaping\nand architecture from a distance, I had never been interested enough\nin the temple to go inside until the day I read a newspaper article that\ntold of a special inner sector of Mormon temples to which no one has\naccess but faithful members of the Church. Even potential converts\nmust not see it. There is one exception to the rule, however. For a few\ndays immediately after a temple is newly constructed, nonmembers\nare allowed to tour the entire structure, including the otherwise restric-\nted section.\nThe newspaper story reported that the Mesa temple had recently\nbeen refurbished and that the renovations had been extensive enough\nto classify it as “new” by Church standards. Thus, for the next several\ndays only, non-Mormon visitors could see the temple area traditionally\nbanned to them. I remember quite well the effect of the article on me:\nI immediately resolved to take a tour. But when I phoned a friend to\nask if he wanted to come along, I came to understand something that\nchanged my decision just as quickly.\nAfter declining the invitation, my friend wondered why I seemed so\nintent on a visit. I was forced to admit that, no, I had never been inclined\ntoward the idea of a temple tour before, that I had no questions about\nthe Mormon religion I wanted answered, that I had no general interest\nin the architecture of houses of worship, and that I expected to find\nnothing more spectacular or stirring than I might see at a number of\nother temples, churches, or cathedrals in the area. It became clear as I\nspoke that the special lure of the temple had a sole cause: If I did not\nexperience the restricted sector shortly, I would never again have the\nchance. Something that, on its own merits, held little appeal for me had\nbecome decidedly more attractive merely because it would soon become\nunavailable.\nSince that encounter with the scarcity principle—that opportunities\nseem more valuable to us when their availability is limited—I have\nbegun to notice its influence over a whole range of my actions. For in-\nstance, I routinely will interrupt an interesting face-to-face conversation\nto answer the ring of an unknown caller. In such a situation, the caller\nhas a compelling feature that my face-to-face partner does not: potential\nunavailability. If I don’t take the call, I might miss it (and the information\nit carries) for good. Never mind that the ongoing conversation may be\nhighly engaging or important—much more than I could reasonably\nexpect an average phone call to be. With each unanswered ring, the\nphone interaction becomes less retrievable. For that reason and for that\nmoment, I want it more than the other.\nThe idea of potential loss plays a large role in human decision making.\nIn fact, people seem to be more motivated by the thought of losing\nsomething than by the thought of gaining something of equal value.\nFor instance, homeowners told how much money they could lose from\ninadequate insulation are more likely to insulate their homes than those\ntold how much money they could save. Similar results have been ob-\ntained by health researchers: Pamphlets urging young women to check\nfor breast cancer through self-examinations are significantly more suc-\ncessful if they state their case in terms of what stands to be lost (e.g.,\n“You can lose several potential health benefits by failing to spend only\nfive minutes each month doing breast self-examination”) rather than\ngained (e.g., “You can gain several potential health benefits by spending\nonly five minutes each month doing breast self-examination”).1\nCollectors of everything from baseball cards to antiques are keenly\naware of the influence of the scarcity principle in determining the worth\nof an item. As a rule, if it is rare or becoming rare, it is more valuable.\nEspecially enlightening as to the importance of scarcity in the collectibles\nmarket is the phenomenon of the “precious mistake.” Flawed items—a\nblurred stamp or a double-struck coin—are sometimes the most valuedRobert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 179\nof all. Thus a stamp carrying a three-eyed likeness of George Washington\nis anatomically incorrect, aesthetically unappealing, and yet highly\nsought after. There is instructive irony here: Imperfections that would\notherwise make for rubbish make for prized possessions when they\nbring along an abiding scarcity.\nWith the scarcity principle operating so powerfully on the worth we\nassign things, it is natural that compliance professionals will do some\nrelated operating of their own. Probably the most straightforward use\nof the scarcity principle occurs in the “limited-number” tactic, when\nthe customer is informed that a certain product is in short supply that\ncannot be guaranteed to last long. During the time I was researching\ncompliance strategies by infiltrating various organizations, I saw the\nlimited-number tactic employed repeatedly in a range of situations:\n“There aren’t more than five convertibles with this engine left in the\nstate. And when they’re gone, that’s it, ’cause we’re not making ’em\nanymore.” “This is one of only two unsold corner lots in the entire de-\nvelopment. You wouldn’t want the other one; it’s got a nasty east-west\nexposure.” “You may want to think seriously about buying more than\none case today because production is backed way up and there’s no\ntelling when we’ll get any more in.”\nSometimes the limited-number information was true, sometimes it\nwas wholly false. But in each instance, the intent was to convince cus-\ntomers of an item’s scarcity and thereby increase its immediate value\nin their eyes. I admit to developing a grudging admiration for the\npractitioners who made this simple device work in a multitude of ways\nand styles. I was most impressed, however, with a particular version\nthat extended the basic approach to its logical extreme by selling a piece\nof merchandise at its scarcest point—when it seemingly could no longer\nbe had. The tactic was played to perfection in one appliance store I in-\nvestigated, where 30 to 50 percent of the stock was regularly listed as\non sale. Suppose a couple in the store seemed from a distance to be\nmoderately interested in a certain sale item. There are all sorts of cues\nthat tip off such interest—closer-than-normal examination of the appli-\nance, a casual look at any instruction booklets associated with the ap-\npliance, discussions held in front of the appliance, but no attempt to\nseek out a salesperson for further information. After observing the\ncouple so engaged, a salesperson might approach and say, “I see you’re\ninterested in this model here, and I can understand why; it’s a great\nmachine at a great price. But, unfortunately, I sold it to another couple\nnot more than twenty minutes ago. And, if I’m not mistaken, it was the\nlast one we had.”\nThe customers’ disappointment registers unmistakably. Because of\nits lost availability, the appliance jumps suddenly in attractiveness.180 / Influence\nTypically, one of the customers asks if there is any chance that an unsold\nmodel still exists in the store’s back room, warehouse, or other location.\n“Well,” the salesperson allows, “that is possible, and I’d be willing to\ncheck. But do I understand that this is the model you want and if I can\nget it for you at this price, you’ll take it?” Therein lies the beauty of the\ntechnique. In accord with the scarcity principle, the customers are asked\nto commit to buying the appliance when it looks least available—and\ntherefore most desirable. Many customers do agree to a purchase at\nthis singularly vulnerable time. Thus, when the salesperson (invariably)\nreturns with the news that an additional supply of the appliance has\nbeen found, it is also with a pen and sales contract in hand. The inform-\nation that the desired model is in good supply may actually make some\ncustomers find it less attractive again.2 But by then, the business trans-\naction has progressed too far for most people to renege. The purchase\ndecision made and committed to publicly at an earlier, crucial point\nstill holds. They buy.\nRelated to the limited-number technique is the “deadline” tactic, in\nwhich some official time limit is placed on the customer’s opportunity\nto get what the compliance professional is offering. Much like my ex-\nperience with the Mormon temple’s inner sanctum, people frequently\nfind themselves doing what they wouldn’t particularly care to do simply\nbecause the time to do so is shrinking. The adept merchandiser makes\nthis tendency pay off by arranging and publicizing customer dead-\nlines—witness the collage of such newspaper ads in Figure 7–3—that\ngenerate interest where none may have existed before. Concentrated\ninstances of this approach often occur in movie advertising. In fact, I\nrecently noticed that one theater owner, with remarkable singleness of\npurpose, had managed to invoke the scarcity principle three separate\ntimes in just five words that read, “Exclusive, limited engagement ends\nsoon!”\nSwindled\nBy Peter Kerr\nNew York Times\nNEW YORK—Daniel Gulban doesn’t remember how his life savings disap-\npeared.\nHe remembers the smooth voice of a salesman on the telephone. He remembers\ndreaming of a fortune in oil and silver futures. But to this day, the 81-year-old retired\nutility worker does not understand how swindlers convinced him to part with\n$18,000.\n“I just wanted to better my life in my waning days,” said Gulban, a resident ofRobert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 181\nHolder, Fla. “But when I found out the truth, I couldn’t eat or sleep. I lost 30 pounds.\nI still can’t believe I would do anything like that.”\nGulban was the victim of a what law enforcement officials call a “boiler-room\noperation,” a ruse that often involves dozens of fast-talking telephone salesmen\ncrammed into a small room where they call thousands of customers each day. The\ncompanies snare hundreds of millions of dollars each year from unsuspecting\ncustomers, according to a U.S. Senate subcommittee on investigations, which issued\na report on the subject last year.\n“They use an impressive Wall Street address, lies and deception to get individuals\nto sink their money into various glamorous-sounding schemes,” said Robert Abrams,\nthe New York State attorney general, who has pursued more than a dozen boiler-\nroom cases in the past four years. “The victims are sometimes persuaded to invest\nthe savings of a lifetime.”\nOrestes J. Mihaly, the New York assistant attorney general in charge of the bureau\nof investor protection and securities, said the companies often operate in three\nstages. First, Mihaly said, comes the “opening call,” in which a salesman identifies\nhimself as representing a company with an impressive-sounding name and address.\nHe will simply ask the potential customer to receive the company’s literature.\nA second call involves a sales pitch, Mihaly said. The salesman first describes\nthe great profits to be made and then tells the customer that it is no longer possible\nto invest. The third call gives the customer a chance to get in on the deal, he said,\nand is offered with a great deal of urgency.\n“The idea is to dangle a carrot in front of the buyer’s face and then take it away,”\nMihaly said. “The aim is to get someone to want to buy quickly, without thinking\ntoo much about it.” Sometimes, Mihaly said, the salesman will be out of breath on\nthe third call and will tell the customer that he “just came off the trading floor.”\nSuch tactics convinced Gulban to part with his life savings. In 1979, a stranger\ncalled him repeatedly and convinced Gulban to wire $1,756 to New York to purchase\nsilver, Gulban said. After another series of telephone calls the salesman cajoled\nGulban into wiring more than $6,000 for crude oil. He eventually wired an addi-\ntional $9,740, but his profits never arrived.\n“My heart sank,” Gulban recalled. “I was not greedy. I just hoped I would see\nbetter days.” Gulban never recouped his losses.\nFIGURE 7-2\nThe Scarcity Scam\nNote how the scarcity principle was employed during the second and\nthird phone calls\nto cause Mr. Gulban to “buy quickly without thinking too much about\nit.” Click, blur.\n(PETER KERR, THE NEW YORK TIMES)\nA variant of the deadline tactic is much favored by some face-to-face,182 / Influence\nhigh-pressure sellers because it carries the purest form of decision\ndeadline: right now. Customers are often told that unless they make an\nimmediate decision to buy, they will have to purchase the item at a\nhigher price or they will be unable to purchase it at all. A prospective\nhealth-club member or automobile buyer might learn that the deal\noffered by the salesperson is good only for that one time; should the\ncustomer leave the premises, the deal is off. One large child-portrait\nphotography company urges parents to buy as many poses and copies\nas they can afford because “stocking limitations force us to burn the\nunsold pictures of your children within twenty-four hours.” A door-to-\ndoor magazine solicitor might say that salespeople are in the customer’s\narea for just a day; after that, they—and the customer’s chance to buy\ntheir magazine package—will be long gone. A home vacuum-cleaner\noperation I infiltrated instructed its sales trainees to claim, “I have so\nmany other people to see that I have the time to visit a family only once.\nIt’s company policy that even if you decide later that you want this\nmachine, I can’t come back and sell it to you.” This, of course, is non-\nsense; the company and its representatives are in the business of making\nsales, and any customer who called for another visit would be accom-\nmodated gladly. As the company sales manager impressed on his\ntrainees, the true purpose of the can’t-come-back claim has nothing to\ndo with reducing overburdened sales schedules. It is to “keep the pro-\nspects from taking the time to think the deal over by scaring them into\nbelieving they can’t have it later, which makes them want it now.”\nPSYCHOLOGICAL REACTANCE\nThe evidence, then, is clear. Compliance practitioners’ reliance on\nscarcity as a weapon of influence is frequent, wide-ranging, systematic,\nand diverse. Whenever such is the case with a weapon of influence, we\ncan feel assured that the principle involved has notable power in direct-\ning human action. In the instance of the scarcity principle, that power\ncomes from two major sources. The first is familiar. Like the other\nweapons of influence, the scarcity principle trades on our weakness for\nshortcuts. The weakness is, as before, an enlightened one. In this case,\nbecause we know that the things that are difficult to possess are typically\nbetter than those that are easy to possess, we can often use an item’s\navailability to help us quickly and correctly decide on its quality. Thus,\none reason for the potency of the scarcity principle is that, by following\nit, we are usually and efficiently right.3Robert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 183\nFIGURE 7-3\nDon’t Wait!\nLast chance to read this now before you turn the page\n(ROBERT B. CIALDINI)\nIn addition, there is a unique, secondary source of power within the\nscarcity principle: As opportunities become less available, we lose\nfreedoms; and we hate to lose the freedoms we already have. This desire\nto preserve our established prerogatives is the centerpiece of psycholo-\ngical reactance theory, developed by psychologist Jack Brehm to explain\nthe human response to diminishing personal control. According to the\ntheory, whenever free choice is limited or threatened, the need to retain\nour freedoms makes us desire them (as well as the goods and services\nassociated with them) significantly more than previously. So when in-\ncreasing scarcity—or anything else—interferes with our prior access to\nsome item, we will react against the interference by wanting and trying\nto possess the item more than before.4\nAs simple as the kernel of the theory seems, its shoots and roots curl\nextensively through much of the social environment. From the garden\nof young love to the jungle of armed revolution to the fruits of the\nmarketplace, impressive amounts of our behavior can be explained by\nexamining for the tendrils of psychological reactance. Before beginning184 / Influence\nsuch an examination, though, it would be helpful to know when people\nfirst show the desire to fight against restrictions of their freedoms.\nChild psychologists have traced the tendency back to the start of the\nthird year of life—a year independently identified as a problem by\nparents and widely known to them as “the terrible twos.” Most parents\ncan attest to the development of a decidedly more contrary style in their\nchildren around this period. Two-year-olds seem masters of the art of\nresistance to outside, especially parental, pressure: Tell them one thing,\nthey do the opposite; give them one toy, they want another; pick them\nup against their will, they wriggle and squirm to be put down; put them\ndown against their will, they claw and struggle to be carried.\nOne Virginia-based study nicely captured the terrible twos style\namong boys who averaged twenty-four months in age. The boys accom-\npanied their mothers into a room containing two equally attractive toys.\nThe toys were always arranged so that one stood next to a transparent\nPlexiglas barrier and the other stood behind the barrier. For some of\nthe boys, the Plexiglas sheet was only a foot tall—forming no real bar-\nrier to the toy behind, since the boys could easily reach over the top.\nFor the other boys, however, the Plexiglas was two feet tall, effectively\nblocking the boys’ access to one toy unless they went around the barrier.\nThe researchers wanted to see how quickly the toddlers would make\ncontact with the toys under these conditions. Their findings were clear.\nWhen the barrier was too small to restrict access to the toy behind it,\nthe boys showed no special preference for either of the toys; on the av-\nerage, the toy next to the barrier was touched just as quickly as the one\nbehind. But when the barrier was big enough to be a true obstacle, the\nboys went directly to the obstructed toy, making contact with it three\ntimes faster than with the unobstructed toy. In all, the boys in this study\ndemonstrated the classic terrible twos’ response to a limitation of their\nfreedom: outright defiance.5\nWhy should psychological reactance emerge at the age of two? Per-\nhaps the answer has to do with a crucial change that most children go\nthrough around this time. It is then that they first come to a full recog-\nnition of themselves as individuals. No longer do they view themselves\nas mere extensions of the social milieu but rather as identifiable, singu-\nlar, and separate.6 This developing concept of autonomy brings naturally\nwith it the concept of freedom. An independent being is one with\nchoices; and a child with the newfound realization that he or she is such\na being will want to explore the length and breadth of the options.\nPerhaps we should be neither surprised nor distressed, then, when our\ntwo-year-olds strain incessantly against our will. They have come to a\nrecent and exhilarating perspective on themselves as free-standing hu-\nman entities. Vital questions of volition, entitlements, and control nowRobert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 185\nneed to be asked and answered within their small minds. The tendency\nto fight for every liberty and against every restriction might be best\nunderstood as a quest for information. By testing severely the limits of\ntheir freedoms (and coincidentally, the patience of their parents), the\nchildren are discovering where in their worlds they can expect to be\ncontrolled and where they can expect to be in control. As we will see\nlater, the wise parent provides highly consistent information.\nAlthough the terrible twos may be the most noticeable age of psycho-\nlogical reactance, we show the strong tendency to react against restric-\ntions on our freedoms of action throughout our lives. One other age\ndoes stand out, however, as a time when this tendency takes an espe-\ncially rebellious form: teenage. Like the twos, this is a period character-\nized by an emerging sense of individuality. For teenagers, the emergence\nis from the role of child, with all of its attendant parental control, and\ntoward the role of adult, with all of its attendant rights and duties. Not\nsurprisingly, adolescents tend to focus less on the duties than on the\nrights they feel they have as young adults. Not surprisingly, again,\nimposing traditional parental authority at these times is often counter-\nproductive; the teenager will sneak, scheme, and fight to resist such\nattempts at control.\nNothing illustrates the boomerang quality of parental pressure on\nadolescent behavior quite so clearly as a phenomenon known as the\n“Romeo and Juliet effect.” As we know, Romeo Montague and Juliet\nCapulet were the ill-fated Shakespearean characters whose love was\ndoomed by a feud between their families. Defying all parental attempts\nto keep them apart, the teenagers won a lasting union in their tragic act\nof twin suicide, an ultimate assertion of free will.\nThe intensity of the couple’s feelings and actions has always been a\nsource of wonderment and puzzlement to observers of the play. How\ncould such inordinate devotion develop so quickly in a pair so young?\nA romantic might suggest rare and perfect love. A social scientist,\nthough, might point to the role of parental interference and the psycho-\nlogical reactance it can produce. Perhaps the passion of Romeo and Juliet\nwas not initially so consuming that it transcended the extensive barriers\nerected by the families. Perhaps, instead, it was fueled to a white heat\nby the placement of those barriers. Could it be that had the youngsters\nbeen left to their own devices, their inflamed devotion would have\namounted to no more than a flicker of puppy love?\nBecause the story is fiction, such questions are, of course, hypothetical,\nand any answers to them are speculative. However, it is possible to ask\nand answer with more certainty similar questions about modern-day\nRomeos and Juliets. Do couples suffering parental interference react by186 / Influence\ncommitting themselves more firmly to the partnership and falling more\ndeeply in love? According to a study done with 140 Colorado couples,\nthat is exactly what they do. In fact, the researchers found that although\nparental interference was linked to some problems in the relation-\nship—the partners viewed one another more critically and reported a\ngreater number of negative behaviors in the other—that interference\nalso made the pair feel greater love and desire for marriage. During the\ncourse of the study, as parental interference intensified, so did the love\nexperience; and when the interference weakened, romantic feelings\nactually cooled.7\nAlthough the Romeo and Juliet effect among modern teenagers may\nseem cute—to outside observers—other manifestations of teenage re-\nactance can prove tragic. For more than a decade, the major message\nof a massive advertising campaign for Virginia Slims cigarettes has\nbeen that today’s women “have come a long way” from the old days\nwhen they were required by social norms to be subdued, proper, and\nladylike. No longer, imply these ads, should a woman have to feel\nbound by chauvinistic and outmoded constraints on her independence\nand, pointedly, on her freedom to smoke cigarettes. Has the message\nbeen successful in triggering defiance of the old strictures among the\ntarget audience? One dismaying statistic suggests a lamentable answer:\nDuring the lengthy duration of this campaign, the percentage of cigarette\nsmokers has risen in only one U.S. demographic group—teenage wo-\nmen.\nFor twos and teens, then, psychological reactance flows across the\nbroad surface of experience, always turbulent and forceful. For most\nof the rest of us, the pool of reactant energy lies quiet and covered,\nerupting geyserlike only on occasion. Still, these eruptions manifest\nthemselves in a variety of fascinating ways that are of interest not only\nto the student of human behavior but to lawmakers and policymakers\nas well.\nFor instance, there’s the odd case of Kennesaw, Georgia, the town\nthat enacted a law requiring every adult resident to own a gun and\nammunition, under penalty of six months in jail and a two-hundred-\ndollar fine. All the features of the Kennesaw gun law make it a prime\ntarget for psychological reactance: The freedom that the law restricts is\nan important, long-standing one to which most American citizens feel\nentitled. Furthermore, the law was passed by the Kennesaw City\nCouncil with a minimum of public input. Reactance theory would\npredict that under these circumstances few of the adults in the town of\nfifty-four hundred would obey. Yet newspaper reports testified that\nthree to four weeks after passage of the law, firearms sales in Kennesaw\nwere—no pun intended—booming.Robert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 187\nHow are we to make sense of this apparent contradiction of the react-\nance principle? By looking a bit more closely at those who were buying\nKennesaw’s guns. Interviews with Kennesaw store owners revealed\nthat the gun buyers were not town residents at all, but visitors, many\nof them lured by publicity to purchase their initial gun in Kennesaw.\nDonna Green, proprietor of a shop described in one newspaper article\nas a virtual “grocery store of firearms,” summed it up: “Business is\ngreat. But they’re almost all being bought by people from out of town.\nWe’ve only had two or three local people buy a gun to comply with the\nlaw.” After passage of the law, then, gun buying had become a frequent\nactivity in Kennesaw, but not among those it was intended to cover;\nthey were massively noncompliant. Only those individuals whose\nfreedom in the matter had not been restricted by the law had the inclin-\nation to live by it.\nA similar situation arose a decade earlier and several hundred miles\nto the south of Kennesaw, when Dade County (containing Miami),\nFlorida, imposed an antiphosphate ordinance prohibiting the use—and\npossession!—of laundry or cleaning products containing phosphates.\nA study done to determine the social impact of the law discovered two\nparallel reactions on the part of Miami residents. First, in what seems\na Florida tradition, many Miamians turned to smuggling. Sometimes\nwith neighbors and friends in large “soap caravans,” they drove to\nnearby counties to load up on phosphate detergents. Hoarding quickly\ndeveloped; and in the rush of obsession that frequently characterizes\nhoarders, families were reported to boast of twenty-year supplies of\nphosphate cleaners.\nThe second reaction to the law was more subtle and more general\nthan the deliberate defiance of the smugglers and hoarders. Spurred\nby the tendency to want what they could no longer have, the majority\nof Miami consumers came to see phosphate cleaners as better products\nthan before. Compared to Tampa residents, who were not affected by\nthe Dade County ordinance, the citizens of Miami rated phosphate de-\ntergents as gentler, more effective in cold water, better whiteners and\nfresheners, more powerful on stains. After passage of the law, they had\neven come to believe that phosphate detergents poured more easily\nthan did the Tampa consumers.8\nThis sort of response is typical of individuals who have lost an estab-\nlished freedom and is crucial to an understanding of how psychological\nreactance and scarcity work on us. When our freedom to have something\nis limited, the item becomes less available, and we experience an in-\ncreased desire for it. However, we rarely recognize that psychological\nreactance has caused us to want the item more; all we know is that we\nwant it. Still, we need to make sense of our desire for the item, so we188 / Influence\nbegin to assign it positive qualities to justify the desire. After all, it is\nnatural to suppose that if one feels drawn to something, it is because\nof the merit of the thing. In the case of the Dade County antiphosphate\nlaw—and in other instances of newly restricted availability—that is a\nfaulty supposition. Phosphate detergents clean, whiten, and pour no\nbetter after they are banned than before. We just assume they do because\nwe find that we desire them more.\nThe tendency to want what has been banned and therefore to presume\nthat it is more worthwhile is not limited to such commodities as laundry\nsoap. In fact, the tendency is not limited to commodities at all but ex-\ntends to restrictions on information. In an age when the ability to ac-\nquire, store, and manage information is becoming increasingly the de-\nterminant of wealth and power, it is important to understand how we\ntypically react to attempts to censor or otherwise constrain our access\nto information. Although much data exist on our reactions to various\nkinds of potentially censorable material—media violence, pornography,\nradical political rhetoric—there is surprisingly little evidence as to our\nreactions to the act of censoring them. Fortunately, the results of the\nfew studies that have been done on the topic are highly consistent. Al-\nmost invariably, our response to the banning of information is a greater\ndesire to receive that information and a more favorable attitude toward\nit than before the ban.9\nThe intriguing thing about the effects of censoring information is not\nthat audience members want to have the information more than they\ndid before; that seems natural. Rather, it is that they come to believe in\nthe information more, even though they haven’t received it. For example,\nwhen University of North Carolina students learned that a speech op-\nposing coed dorms on campus would be banned, they became more\nopposed to the idea of coed dorms. Thus, without ever hearing the\nspeech, they became more sympathetic to its argument. This raises the\nworrisome possibility that especially clever individuals holding a weak\nor unpopular position can get us to agree with that position by arranging\nto have their message restricted. The irony is that for such\npeople—members of fringe political groups, for example—the most\neffective strategy may not be to publicize their unpopular views, but\nto get those views officially censored and then to publicize the censor-\nship. Perhaps the authors of this country’s Constitution were acting as\nmuch as sophisticated social psychologists as staunch civil libertarians\nwhen they wrote the remarkably permissive free-speech provision of\nthe First Amendment. By refusing to restrain freedom of speech, they\nmay have been attempting to minimize the chance that new politicalRobert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 189\nnotions would win support via the irrational course of psychological\nreactance.\nOf course, political ideas are not the only kind that are susceptible to\nrestriction. Access to sexually relevant material is frequently limited.\nAlthough not as sensational as the occasional police crackdowns on\n“adult” bookstores and theaters, regular pressure is applied by parents\nand by citizens’ groups to censor the sexual content of educational\nmaterial ranging from sex education and hygiene texts to books on the\nshelves of school libraries. Both sides in the struggle seem to be well\nintentioned, and the issues are not simple, since they involve such\nmatters as morality, art, parental control over the schools, and First\nAmendment freedoms. But from a purely psychological point of view,\nthose favoring strict censorship may wish to examine closely the results\nof a study done on Purdue University undergraduates.10 The students\nwere shown some advertisements for a novel. For half the students, the\nadvertising copy included the statement, “a book for adults only, restric-\nted to those 21 years and over”; the other half of the students read about\nno such age restriction on the book. When the researchers later asked\nthe students to indicate their feelings toward the book, they discovered\nthe same pair of reactions we have noted with other bans: Those who\nlearned of the age restriction (1) wanted to read the book more and (2)\nbelieved that they would like the book more than did those who thought\ntheir access to the book was unlimited.\nIt might be argued that although these results may be true for a small\nsample of sexually inclined college students, they would not apply to\nstudents in junior and senior high schools, where the sex curricula\nbattles are actually being waged. Two factors make me doubt such an\nargument. First, developmental psychologists report that as a general\nstyle, the desire to oppose adult control begins quite soon in adolescence,\naround the start of the teenage years. Nonscientific observers have also\nnoted the early rise of these strong oppositional tendencies. Shakespeare,\nscholars tell us, placed Romeo and Juliet at the ages of fifteen and thir-\nteen years, respectively. Second, the pattern of reactions exhibited by\nthe Purdue students is not unique and thus can’t be attributed to any\ngreat preoccupation with sex that college students may have. The pattern\nis common to externally imposed restrictions in general. Limiting access\nto the book had the same effects as did banning phosphate detergent\nin Florida or censoring a speech in North Carolina: The people involved\ncame to want the restricted item more and, as a result, came to feel more\nfavorable toward it.\nThose who support the official banning of sexually relevant materials\nfrom school curricula have the avowed purpose of reducing the orient-\nation of the society, especially its youth, toward eroticism. In the light190 / Influence\nof the Purdue study and in the context of other research on the effects\nof imposed restraints, one must wonder whether official censorship as\na means may not be antithetical to the goal. If we are to believe the im-\nplications of the research, then the censorship is likely to increase the\ndesire of students for sexual material and, consequently, to cause them\nto view themselves as the kind of individuals who like such material.\nThe term “official censorship” usually makes us think of bans on\npolitical or sexual material; yet there is another common sort of official\ncensorship that we don’t think of in the same way, probably because it\noccurs after the fact. Often in a jury trial, a piece of evidence or testimony\nwill be introduced, only to be ruled inadmissi-ble by the presiding\njudge, who may then admonish the jurors to disregard that evidence.\nFrom this perspective, the judge may be viewed as a censor, though\nthe form of censorship is odd. The presentation of the information to\nthe jury is not banned—it’s too late for that—it’s the jury’s use of the\ninformation that is banned. How effective are such instructions from a\njudge? And is it possible that, for jury members who feel it is their right\nto consider all the available information, declarations of inadmissibility\nmay actually cause psychological reactance, leading the jurors to use\nthe evidence to a greater extent?\nThese were some of the questions asked in a large-scale jury-research\nproject conducted by the University of Chicago Law School. One reason\nthe results of the Chicago jury project are informative is that the parti-\ncipants were individuals who were actually on jury duty at the time\nand who agreed to be members of “experimental juries” formed by the\nresearchers. These experimental juries then heard tapes of evidence\nfrom previous trials and deliberated as if they were deciding the case.\nIn the study most relevant to our interest in official censorship, thirty\nsuch juries heard the case of a woman who was injured by a car driven\nby a careless male defendant. The first finding of the study was no\nsurprise: When the driver said he had liability insurance, the jurors\nawarded his victim an average of four thousand dollars more than when\nhe said he had no insurance (thirty-seven thousand dollars vs. thirty-\nthree thousand dollars). Thus, as insurance companies have long sus-\npected, juries make larger awards to victims if an insurance company\nwill have to pay. The second finding of the study is the fascinating one,\nthough. If the driver said he was insured and the judge ruled that\nevidence inadmissible (directing the jury to disregard it), the instruction\nto disregard had a boomerang effect, causing an average award of forty-\nsix thousand dollars. So when certain juries learned that the driver was\ninsured, they increased the damage payment by four thousand dollars.\nBut when other juries were told officially that they must not use that\ninformation, they used it still more, increasing the damage payment byRobert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 191\nthirteen thousand dollars. It appears, then, that even proper, official\ncensorship in a courtroom setting creates problems for the censor. We\nreact to information restriction there, as usual, by valuing the banned\ninformation more than ever.11\nThe realization that we value limited information allows us to apply\nthe scarcity principle to realms beyond material commodities. The\nprinciple works for messages, communications, and knowledge, too.\nTaking this perspective, we can see that information may not have to\nbe censored for us to value it more; it need only be scarce. According\nto the scarcity principle, then, we will find a piece of information more\npersuasive if we think we can’t get it elsewhere. This idea that exclusive\ninformation is more persuasive information is central to the thinking\nof two psychologists, Timothy Brock and Howard Fromkin, who have\ndeveloped a “commodity theory” analysis of persuasion.12\nThe strongest support I know for Brock and Fromkin’s theory comes\nfrom a small experiment done by a student of mine. At the time, the\nstudent was also a successful businessman, the owner of a beef-import-\ning company, who had returned to school to get advanced training in\nmarketing. After we talked in my office one day about scarcity and ex-\nclusivity of information, he decided to do a study using his sales staff.\nThe company’s customers—buyers for supermarkets or other retail\nfood outlets—were phoned as usual by a salesperson and asked for a\npurchase in one of three ways. One set of customers heard a standard\nsales presentation before being asked for their orders. Another set of\ncustomers heard the standard sales presentation plus information that\nthe supply of imported beef was likely to be scarce in the upcoming\nmonths. A third group received the standard sales presentation and\nthe information about a scarce supply of beef, too; however, they also\nlearned that the scarce-supply news was not generally available inform-\nation—it had come, they were told, from certain exclusive contacts that\nthe company had. Thus the customers who received this last sales\npresentation learned that not only was the availability of the product\nlimited, so also was the news concerning it—the scarcity double\nwhammy.\nThe results of the experiment quickly become apparent when the\ncompany salespeople began to urge the owner to buy more beef because\nthere wasn’t enough in the inventory to keep up with all the orders\nthey were receiving. Compared to the customers who got only the\nstandard sales appeal, those who were also told about the future scarcity\nof beef bought more than twice as much. But the real boost in sales oc-\ncurred among the customers who heard of the impending scarcity via\n“exclusive” information. They purchased six times the amount that the\ncustomers who received only the standard sales pitch did. Apparently192 / Influence\nthe fact that the news carrying the scarcity of information was itself\nscarce made it especially persuasive.13\nOPTIMAL CONDITIONS\nMuch like the other effective weapons of influence, the scarcity principle\nis more effective at some times than at other times. An important prac-\ntical problem, then, is to find out when scarcity works best on us. A\ngreat deal can be learned in this regard from an experiment devised by\nsocial psychologist Stephen Worchel.14 The basic procedure used by\nWorchel and his research team was simple: Participants in a consumer-\npreference study were given a chocolate-chip cookie from a jar and\nasked to taste and rate its quality. For half of the raters, the jar contained\nten cookies; for the other half, it contained just two. As we might expect\nfrom the scarcity principle, when the cookie was one of the only two\navailable, it was rated more favorably than when it was one of ten. The\ncookie in short supply was rated as more desirable to eat in the future,\nmore attractive as a consumer item, and more costly than the identical\ncookie in abundant supply.\nAlthough this pattern of results provides a rather striking validation\nof the scarcity principle, it doesn’t tell us anything we don’t already\nknow. Once again, we see that a less-available item is more desired and\nvalued. The real worth of the cookie study comes from two additional\nfindings. Let’s take them one at a time, as each deserves a thorough\nconsideration.\nThe first of these noteworthy results involved a small variation in\nthe experiment’s basic procedure. Rather than rating the cookies under\nconditions of constant scarcity, some participants were first given a jar\nof ten cookies that was then replaced by a jar of two cookies. Thus, be-\nfore taking a bite, certain of the participants saw their abundant supply\nof cookies reduced to a scarce supply. Other participants, however,\nknew only scarcity of supply from the outset, since the number of\ncookies in their jars was left at two. With this procedure, the researchers\nwere seeking to answer a question about types of scarcity: Do we value\nmore those things that have recently become less available to us, or\nthose things that have always been scarce? In the cookie experiment,\nthe answer was plain. The drop from abundance to scarcity produced\na decidedly more positive reaction to the cookies than did constant\nscarcity.\nThe idea that newly experienced scarcity is the more powerful kind\napplies to situations well beyond the bounds of the cookie study. For\nexample, social scientists have determined that such scarcity is a primaryRobert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 193\ncause of political turmoil and violence. Perhaps the most prominent\nproponent of this argument is James C. Davies, who states that we are\nmost likely to find revolutions where a period of improving economic\nand social conditions is followed by a short, sharp reversal in those\nconditions. Thus it is not the traditionally most downtrodden\npeople—who have come to see their deprivation as part of the natural\norder of things—who are especially liable to revolt. Instead, revolution-\naries are more likely to be those who have been given at least some taste\nof a better life. When the economic and social improvements they have\nexperienced and come to expect suddenly become less available, they\ndesire them more than ever and often rise up violently to secure them.15\nDavies has gathered persuasive evidence for his novel thesis from a\nrange of revolutions, revolts, and internal wars, including the French,\nRussian, and Egyptian revolutions as well as such domestic uprisings\nas Dorr’s Rebellion in nineteenth-century Rhode Island, the American\nCivil War, and the urban black riots of the 1960s. In each case, a time\nof increasing well-being preceded a tight cluster of reversals that burst\ninto violence.\nThe racial conflict in America’s cities during the mid-1960s repre-\nsents a case in point that many of us can recall. At the time, it was not\nuncommon to hear the question, “Why now?” It didn’t seem to make\nsense that within their three-hundred-year history, most of which had\nbeen spent in servitude and much of the rest in privation, American\nblacks would choose the socially progressive sixties in which to revolt.\nIndeed, as Davies points out, the two decades after the start of World\nWar II had brought dramatic political and economic gains to the black\npopulation. In 1940, blacks faced stringent legal restrictions in such\nareas as housing, transportation, and education; moreover, even with\nthe same amount of education, the average black family earned only a\nbit more than half of its counterpart white family. Fifteen years later,\nmuch had changed. Federal legislation had struck down as unacceptable\nformal and informal attempts to segregate blacks in schools, public\nplaces, housing, and employment settings. Large economic advances\nhad been made, too; black family income had risen from 56 percent to\n80 percent of that of a comparably educated white family.\nBut then, according to Davies’s analysis of social conditions, this\nrapid progress was stymied by events that soured the heady optimism\nof previous years. First, political and legal change proved substantially\neasier to enact than social change. Despite all the progressive legislation\nof the forties and fifties, blacks perceived that most neighborhoods,\njobs, and schools remained segregated. Thus the Washington-based\nvictories came to feel like defeats at home. For example, in the four\nyears following the U.S. Supreme Court’s 1954 decision to integrate all194 / Influence\npublic schools, blacks were the targets of 530 acts of violence (direct\nintimidation of black children and parents, bombings, and burnings)\ndesigned to prevent school integration. This violence generated the\nperception of another sort of setback in black progress. For the first time\nsince well before World War II, when lynchings had occurred at an\naverage rate of seventy-eight per year, blacks had to be concerned about\nthe basic safety of their families. The new violence was not limited to\nthe education issue, either. Peaceful civil-rights demonstrations of the\ntime were frequently confronted by hostile crowds—and police.\nStill another type of downturn occurred—in pocketbook prog-ress.\nIn 1962, the income of a black family had slid back to 74 percent of that\nof a similarly educated white family. By Davies’s argument, the most\nilluminating aspect of this 74 percent figure is not that it represented a\nlong-term increase in prosperity from pre-1940s levels but that it repres-\nented a short-term decline from the flush mid-1950s levels. In the next\nyear came the Birmingham riots and, in staccato succession, scores of\nviolent demonstrations, building toward the major upheavals of Watts,\nNewark, and Detroit.\nIn keeping with a distinct historical pattern of revolution, blacks in\nthe United States were more rebellious when their prolonged progress\nwas curtailed somewhat than they were before it began. This pattern\noffers a valuable lesson for would-be rulers: When it comes to freedoms,\nit is more dangerous to have given for a while than never to have given\nat all. The problem for a government that seeks to improve the political\nand economic status of a traditionally oppressed group is that, in so\ndoing, it establishes freedoms for the group where none existed before.\nAnd should these now established freedoms become less available, there\nwill be an especially hot variety of hell to pay.\nWe can look to much more recent events in the former Soviet Union\nfor evidence that this basic rule still holds. After decades of repression,\nMikhail Gorbachev began granting the Soviet populace new liberties,\nprivileges, and choices via the twin policies of glasnost and perestroika.\nAlarmed by the direction their nation was taking, a small group of\ngovernment, military, and KGB officials staged a coup, placing\nGorbachev under house arrest and announcing on August 19, 1991,\nthat they had assumed power and were moving to reinstate the old\norder. Most of the world imagined that the Soviet people, known for\ntheir characteristic acquiescence to subjugation, would passively yield\nas they had always done. Time magazine editor Lance Morrow described\nhis own reaction similarly: “At first the coup seemed to confirm the\nnorm. The news administered a dark shock, followed immediately by\na depressed sense of resignation: of course, of course, the Russians mustRobert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 195\nrevert to their essential selves, to their own history. Gorbachev and\nglasnost were an aberration; now we are back to fatal normality.”\nBut these were not to be normal times. For one thing, Gorbachev had\nnot governed in the tradition of the czars or Stalin or any of the line of\noppressive postwar rulers who had not allowed even a breath of free-\ndom to the masses. He had ceded them certain rights and choices. And\nwhen these now-established freedoms were threatened, the people\nlashed out the way a dog would if someone tried taking a fresh bone\nfrom its mouth. Within hours of the junta’s announcement, thousands\nwere in the streets, erecting barricades, confronting armed troops, sur-\nrounding tanks, and defying curfews. The uprising was so swift, so\nmassive, so unitary in its opposition to any retreat from the gains of\nglasnost that after only three riotous days, the astonished officials relen-\nted, surrendering their power and pleading for mercy from President\nGorbachev. Had they been students of history—or of psychology—the\nfailed plotters would not have been so surprised by the tidal wave of\npopular resistance that swallowed their coup. From the vantage point\nof either discipline, they could have learned an invariant lesson:\nFreedoms once granted will not be relinquished without a fight.\nThe lesson applies as well to the politics of family as country. The\nparent who grants privileges or enforces rules erratically invites rebel-\nliousness by unwittingly establishing freedoms for the child. The parent\nwho only sometimes prohibits between-meal sweets may create for the\nchild the freedom to have such snacks. At that point, enforcing the rule\nbecomes a much more difficult and explosive matter because the child\nis no longer merely lacking a never-possessed right but is losing an es-\ntablished one. As we have seen in the case of political freedoms and\n(especially pertinent to the present discussion) chocolate-chip cookies,\npeople see a thing as more desirable when it has recently become less\navailable than when it has been scarce all along. We should not be sur-\nprised, then, when research shows that parents who enforce discipline\ninconsistently produce generally rebellious children.16\nLet’s look back to the cookie study for another insight into the way\nwe react to scarcity. We’ve already seen from the results of that study\nthat scarce cookies were rated higher than abundant cookies and that\nnewly scarce cookies were rated higher still. Staying with the newly\nscarce cookies now, there was a certain cookie that was the highest rated\nof all: those that became less available because of a demand for them.\nRemember that in the experiment the participants who experienced\nnew scarcity had been given a jar of ten cookies that was then replaced\nwith a jar of only two cookies. Actually, the researchers did this in one\nof two ways. To certain participants, it was explained that some of their196 / Influence\ncookies had to be given away to other raters to supply the demand for\ncookies in the study. To another set of participants, it was explained\nthat their number of cookies had to be reduced because the researcher\nhad simply made a mistake and given them the wrong jar initially. The\nresults showed that those whose cookies became scarce through the\nprocess of social demand liked them significantly more than those\nwhose cookies became scarce by mistake. In fact, the cookies made less\navailable through social demand were rated the most desirable of any\nin the study.\nThis finding highlights the importance of competition in the pursuit\nof limited resources. Not only do we want the same item more when\nit is scarce, we want it most when we are in competition for it. Advert-\nisers often try to exploit this tendency in us. In their ads, we learn that\n“popular demand” for an item is so great that we must “hurry to buy,”\nor we see a crowd pressing against the doors of a store before the start\nof a sale, or we watch a flock of hands quickly deplete a supermarket\nshelf of a product. There is more to such images than the idea of ordin-\nary social proof. The message is not just that the product is good because\nother people think so, but also that we are in direct competition with\nthose people for it.\nThe feeling of being in competition for scarce resources has powerfully\nmotivating properties. The ardor of an indifferent lover surges with the\nappearance of a rival. It is often for reasons of strategy, therefore, that\nromantic partners reveal (or invent) the attentions of a new admirer.\nSalespeople are taught to play the same game with indecisive customers.\nFor example, a realtor who is trying to sell a house to a “fence-sitting”\nprospect will sometimes call the prospect with news of another potential\nbuyer who has seen the house, liked it, and is scheduled to return the\nfollowing day to talk about terms. When wholly fabricated, the new\nbidder is commonly described as an outsider with plenty of money:\n“an out-of-state investor buying for tax purposes” and “a physician\nand his wife moving into town” are favorites. The tactic, called in some\ncircles “goosing ’em off the fence,” can work devastatingly well. The\nthought of losing out to a rival frequently turns a buyer from hesitant\nto zealous.\nThere is something almost physical about the desire to have a con-\ntested item. Shoppers at big close-out or bargain sales report being\ncaught up emotionally in the event. Charged by the crush of competitors,\nthey swarm and struggle to claim merchandise they would otherwise\ndisdain. Such behavior brings to mind the “feeding frenzy” of wild,\nindiscriminate eating among animal groups. Commercial fishermen\nexploit this phenomenon by throwing a quantity of loose bait to large\nschools of certain fish. Soon the water is a roiling expanse of thrashingRobert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 197\nfins and snapping mouths competing for the food. At this point, the\nfishermen save time and money by dropping unbaited lines into the\nwater, since the crazed fish will bite ferociously at anything now, includ-\ning bare metal hooks.\nThere is a noticeable parallel between the ways that commercial\nfishermen and department stores generate a competitive fury in those\nthey wish to hook. To attract and arouse the catch, fishermen scatter\nsome loose bait called chum. For similar reasons, department stores\nholding a bargain sale toss out a few especially good deals on promin-\nently advertised items called loss leaders. If the bait, of either form, has\ndone its job, a large and eager crowd forms to snap it up. Soon, in the\nrush to score, the group becomes agitated, nearly blinded, by the ad-\nversarial nature of the situation. Humans and fish alike lose perspective\non what they want and begin striking at whatever is being contested.\nOne wonders whether the tuna flapping on a dry deck with only a bare\nhook in its mouth shares the what-hit-me bewilderment of the shopper\narriving home with only a load of department-store bilge.\nLest we believe that the competition-for-limited-resources-fever occurs\nonly in such unsophisticated forms of life as tuna and bargain-basement\nshoppers, we should examine the story behind a remarkable purchase\ndecision made in 1973 by Barry Diller, who was then vice president for\nprime-time programming at the American Broadcasting Company, but\nwho has since been labeled the “miracle mogul” by Time magazine in\nreference to his remarkable successes as head of Paramount Pictures\nand the Fox Television Network. He agreed to pay $3.3 million for a\nsingle television showing of the movie The Poseidon Adventure. The figure\nis noteworthy in that it greatly exceeded the highest price ever previ-\nously paid for a one-time movie showing: $2 million for Patton. In fact,\nthe payment was so excessive that ABC figured to lose $1 million on\nthe Poseidon showing. As NBC vice president for special programs Bill\nStorke declared at the time, “There’s no way they can get their money\nback, no way at all.”\nHow could an astute and experienced businessman like Diller go for\na deal that would produce an expected loss of a million dollars? The\nanswer may lie in a second noteworthy aspect of the sale: It was the\nfirst time that a motion picture had been offered to the networks in an\nopen-bid auction. Never before had the three major commercial net-\nworks been forced to battle for a scarce resource in quite this way. The\nnovel idea of a competitive auction was the brainchild of the movie’s\nflamboyant showman-producer, Irwin Allen, and a 20th Century Fox\nvice president, William Self, who must have been ecstatic about the\noutcome. But how can we be sure that it was the auction format that198 / Influence\ngenerated the spectacular sales price rather than the blockbuster quality\nof the movie itself?\nSome comments from the auction participants provide impressive\nevidence. First came a statement from the victor, Barry Diller, intended\nto set future policy for his network. In language sounding as if it could\nhave escaped only from between clenched teeth, he said, “ABC has\ndecided regarding its policy for the future that it would never again\nenter into an auction situation.” Even more instructive are the remarks\nof Diller’s rival, Robert Wood, then president of CBS Television, who\nnearly lost his head and outbid his competitors at ABC and NBC:\nWe were very rational at the start. We priced the movie out, in\nterms of what it could bring in for us, then allowed a certain value\non top of that for exploitation.\nBut then the bidding started. ABC opened with two million. I\ncame back with two point four. ABC went to two point eight. And\nthe fever of the thing caught us. Like a guy who had lost his mind,\nI kept bidding. Finally, I went to three point two; and there came\na moment when I said to myself, “Good grief, if I get it, what the\nheck am I going to do with it?” When ABC finally topped me, my\nmain feeling was relief.\nIt’s been very educational.17\nAccording to interviewer Bob MacKenzie, when Wood made his “It’s\nbeen very educational” statement, he was smiling. We can be sure that\nwhen ABC’s Diller made his “never again” announcement, he was not.\nBoth men had clearly learned something from the “Great Poseidon\nAuction.” But for one, there had been a $1 million tuition charge. Fortu-\nnately, there is a valuable but drastically less expensive lesson here for\nus, too. It is instructive to note that the smiling man was the one who\nhad lost the highly sought-after prize. As a general rule, whenever the\ndust settles and we find losers looking and speaking like winners (and\nvice versa), we should be especially wary of the conditions that kicked\nup the dust—in the present case, open competition for a scarce resource.\nAs the TV executives now know, extreme caution is advised whenever\nwe encounter the devilish construction of scarcity plus rivalry.\nHOW TO SAY NO\nIt is easy enough to feel properly warned against scarcity pressures;\nbut it is substantially more difficult to act on that warning. Part of the\nproblem is that our typical reaction to scarcity hinders our ability to\nthink. When we watch something we want become less available, a\nphysical agitation sets in. Especially in those cases involving directRobert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 199\ncompetition, the blood comes up, the focus narrows, and emotions rise.\nAs this visceral current advances, the cognitive, rational side retreats.\nIn the rush of arousal, it is difficult to be calm and studied in our ap-\nproach. As CBS Television’s president, Robert Wood, commented in\nthe wake of his Poseidon adventure, “You get caught up in the mania\nof the thing, the acceleration of it. Logic goes right out the window.”\nHere’s our predicament, then: Knowing the causes and workings of\nscarcity pressures may not be sufficient to protect us from them because\nknowing is a cognitive thing, and cognitive processes are suppressed\nby our emotional reaction to scarcity. In fact, this may be the reason for\nthe great effectiveness of scarcity tactics. When they are employed\nproperly, our first line of defense against foolish behavior—a thoughtful\nanalysis of the situation—becomes less likely.\nIf, because of brain-clouding arousal, we can’t rely on our knowledge\nabout the scarcity principle to stimulate properly cautious behavior,\nwhat can we use? Perhaps, in fine jujitsu style, we can use the arousal\nitself as our prime cue. In this way we can turn the enemy’s strength\nto our advantage. Rather than relying on a considered, cognitive ana-\nlysis of the entire situation, we might simply tune ourselves to the in-\nternal, visceral sweep for our warning. By learning to flag the experience\nof heightening arousal in a compliance situation, we can alert ourselves\nto the possibility of scarcity tactics there and to the need for caution.\nBut suppose we accomplish this trick of using the rising tide of\narousal as a signal to calm ourselves and to proceed with care. What\nthen? Is there any other piece of information we can use to help make\na proper decision in the face of scarcity? After all, merely recognizing\nthat we ought to move carefully doesn’t tell us the direction in which\nto move; it only provides the necessary context for a thoughtful decision.\nFortunately, there is information available on which we can base\nthoughtful decisions about scarce items. It comes, once again, from the\nchocolate-chip-cookie study, where the researchers uncovered something\nthat seems strange but rings true regarding scarcity: Even though the\nscarce cookies were rated as significantly more desirable, they were not\nrated as any better-tasting than the abundant cookies. So despite the\nincreased yearning that scarcity caused (the raters said they wanted to\nhave more of the scarce cookies in the future and would pay a greater\nprice for them), it did not make the cookies taste one whit better. Therein\nlies an important insight. The joy is not in experiencing a scarce commod-\nity but in possessing it. It is important that we not confuse the two.\nWhenever we confront the scarcity pressures surrounding some item,\nwe must also confront the question of what it is we want from the item.\nIf the answer is that we want the thing for the social, economic, or\npsychological benefits of possessing something rare, then, fine; scarcity200 / Influence\npressures will give us a good indication of how much we would want\nto pay for it—the less available it is, the more valuable to us it will be.\nBut very often we don’t want a thing purely for the sake of owning it.\nWe want it, instead, for its utility value; we want to eat it or drink it or\ntouch it or hear it or drive it or otherwise use it. In such cases it is vital\nto remember that scarce things do not taste or feel or sound or ride or\nwork any better because of their limited availability.\nAlthough this is a simple point, it can often escape us when we exper-\nience the heightened desirability that scarce items naturally possess. I\ncan cite a family example. My brother Richard supported himself\nthrough school by employing a compliance trick that cashed in hand-\nsomely on the tendency of most people to miss that simple point. In\nfact, his tactic was so effective that he had to work only a few hours\neach weekend for his money, leaving the rest of the time free for his\nstudies.\nRichard sold cars, but not in a showroom nor on a car lot. He would\nbuy a couple of used cars sold privately through the newspaper on one\nweekend and, adding nothing but soap and water, would sell them at\na decided profit through the newspaper on the following weekend. To\ndo this, he had to know three things. First, he had to know enough\nabout cars to buy those that were offered for sale at the bottom of their\nblue-book price range but could be legitimately resold for a higher price.\nSecond, once he got the car, he had to know how to write a newspaper\nad that would stimulate substantial buyer interest. Third, once a buyer\narrived, he had to know how to use the scarcity principle to generate\nmore desire for the car than it perhaps deserved. Richard knew how to\ndo all three. For our purposes, though, we need to examine his craft\nwith just the third.\nFor a car he had purchased on the prior weekend, he would place an\nad in the Sunday paper. Because he knew how to construct a good ad,\nhe usually received an array of calls from potential buyers on Sunday\nmorning. Each prospect who was interested enough to want to see the\ncar was given an appointment time—the same appointment time. So if six\npeople were scheduled, they were all scheduled for, say, two o’clock\nthat afternoon. This little device of simultaneous scheduling paved the\nway for later compliance because it created an atmosphere of competi-\ntion for a limited resource.\nTypically, the first prospect to arrive would begin a studied examin-\nation of the car and would engage in standard car-buying behavior,\nsuch as pointing out any blemishes or deficiencies or asking if the price\nwas negotiable. The psychology of the situation changed radically,\nhowever, when the second buyer drove up. The availability of the car\nto either prospect suddenly became limited by the presence of the other.Robert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 201\nOften the earlier arrival, inadvertently stoking the sense of rivalry,\nwould assert his right to primary consideration. “Just a minute, now.\nI was here first.” If he didn’t assert that right, Richard would do it for\nhim. Addressing the second buyer, Richard would say, “Excuse me,\nbut this other gentleman was here before you. So can I ask you to wait\non the other side of the driveway for a few minutes until he’s finished\nlooking at the car? Then, if he decides he doesn’t want it or if he can’t\nmake up his mind, I’ll show it to you.”\nRichard claims it was possible to watch the agitation grow on the\nfirst buyer’s face. His leisurely assessment of the car’s pros and cons\nhad suddenly become a now-or-never, limited-time-only rush to decision\nover a contested resource. If he didn’t decide for the car—at Richard’s\nasking price—in the next few minutes, he might lose it for good to\nthat…that…lurking newcomer over there. For his part, the second\nbuyer would be equally agitated by the combination of rivalry and re-\nstricted availability. He would pace on the periphery, visibly straining\nto get at this now more desirable hunk of metal. Should two-o’clock\nappointment number one fail to buy or even fail to decide quickly\nenough, two-o’clock appointment number two was ready to pounce.\nIf these conditions alone were not enough to secure a favorable pur-\nchase decision immediately, the trap snapped surely shut as soon as\nthe third two-o’clock appointment arrived on the scene. According to\nRichard, stacked-up competition was usually too much for the first\nprospect to bear. He would end the pressure quickly by either agreeing\nto Richard’s price or by leaving abruptly. In the latter instance, the\nsecond arrival would strike at the chance to buy out of a sense of relief\ncoupled with a new feeling of rivalry with that…that…lurking new-\ncomer over there.\nAll those buyers who contributed to my brother’s college education\nfailed to recognize a fundamental fact about their purchases: The in-\ncreased desire that spurred them to buy had little to do with the merits\nof the car. That failure of recognition occurred for two reasons. First,\nthe situation Richard arranged for them produced an emotional reaction\nthat made it difficult for them to think straight. Second, as a con-\nsequence, they never stopped to think that the reason they wanted the\ncar in the first place was to use it, not merely to have it. And the com-\npetition-for-a-scarce-resource pressures Richard applied affected only\ntheir desire to have the car in the sense of possessing it. Those pressures\ndid not affect the value of the car in terms of the real purpose for which\nthey had wanted it.\nShould we find ourselves beset by scarcity pressures in a compliance\nsituation, then, our best response would occur in a two-stage sequence.202 / Influence\nAs soon as we feel the tide of emotional arousal that flows from scarcity\ninfluences, we should use that rise in arousal as a signal to stop short.\nPanicky, feverish reactions have no place in wise compliance decisions.\nWe need to calm ourselves and regain a rational perspective. Once that\nis done, we can move to the second stage by asking ourselves why we\nwant the item under consideration. If the answer is that we want it\nprimarily for the purpose of owning it, then we should use its availab-\nility to help gauge how much we want to spend for it. However, if the\nanswer is that we want it primarily for its function (that is, we want\nsomething good to drive, drink, eat, etc.), then we must remember that\nthe item under consideration will function equally well whether scarce\nor plentiful. Quite simply, we need to recall that the scarce cookies\ndidn’t taste any better.\nREADER’S REPORT\nFrom a Blacksburg, Virginia, Woman\n“Last Christmas I met a twenty-seven-year-old man.

The program\nwas made distinctive by Pine’s caustic and confrontational style with\nhis guests—for the most part, a collection of exposure-hungry entertain-\ners, would-be celebrities, and representatives of fringe political or social\norganizations. The host’s abrasive approach was designed to provoke\nhis guests into arguments, to fluster them into embarrassing admissions,\nand generally to make them look foolish. It was not uncommon for Pine\nto introduce a visitor and launch immediately into an attack on the in-\ndividual’s beliefs, talent, or appearance. Some people claimed that Pine’s\nacid personal style was partially caused by a leg amputation that had\nembittered him to life; others said no, that he was just vituperous by\nnature.\nOne evening rock musician Frank Zappa was a guest on the show.\nThis was at a time in the sixties when very long hair on men was still\nunusual and controversial. As soon as Zappa had been introduced and\nseated, the following exchange occurred:\nPINE: I guess your long hair makes you a girl.\nZAPPA: I guess your wooden leg makes you a table.\nAside from containing what may be my favorite ad-lib, the above\ndialogue illustrates a fundamental theme of this book: Very often in\nmaking a decision about someone or something, we don’t use all the\nrelevant available information; we use, instead, only a single, highly\nrepresentative piece of the total. And an isolated piece of information,\neven though it normally counsels us correctly, can lead us to clearly\nstupid mistakes—mistakes that, when exploited by clever others, leave\nus looking silly or worse.\nAt the same time, a complicating companion theme has been present\nthroughout this book: Despite the susceptibility to stupid decisions that\naccompanies a reliance on a single feature of the available data, the pace\nof modern life demands that we frequently use this shortcut. Recall that\nearly in Chapter 1, our shortcut approach was likened to the automatic\nresponding of lower animals, whose elaborate behavior patterns could\nbe triggered by the presence of a lone stimulus feature—a “cheep-cheep”\nsound, a shade of red breast feather, or a specific sequence of light\nflashes. The reason infrahumans must often rely on such solitary stim-\nulus features is their restricted mental capability. Their small brains\ncannot begin to register and process all the relevant information in their\nenvironments. So these species have evolved special sensitivities to\ncertain aspects of the information. Because those selected aspects of\ninformation are normally enough to cue a correct response, the system\nis usually very efficient: Whenever a female turkey hears “cheep-cheep,”\nclick, whirr, out rolls the proper maternal behavior in a mechanical\nfashion that conserves much of her limited brainpower for dealing with\nthe variety of other situations and choices she must face in her day.\nWe, of course, have vastly more effective brain mechanisms than\nmother turkeys, or any other animal group, for that matter. We are\nunchallenged in the ability to take into account a multitude of relevant\nfacts and, consequently, to make good decisions. Indeed, it is this in-\nformation-processing advantage over other species that has helped\nmake us the dominant form of life on the planet.\nStill, we have our capacity limitations, too; and, for the sake of effi-\nciency, we must sometimes retreat from the time-consuming, sophistic-\nated, fully informed brand of decision making to a more automatic,\nprimitive, single-feature type of responding. For instance, in deciding206 / Influence\nwhether to say yes or no to a requester, it is clear that we frequently\npay attention to but one piece of the relevant information in the situ-\nation. We have been exploring several of the most popular of the single\npieces of information that we use to prompt our compliance decisions.\nThey are the most popular prompts precisely because they are the most\nreliable ones, those that normally point us toward the correct choice.\nThat is why we employ the factors of reciprocation, consistency, social\nproof, liking, authority, and scarcity so often and so automatically in\nmaking our compliance decisions. Each, by itself, provides a highly re-\nliable cue as to when we will be better off saying yes than no.\nWe are likely to use these lone cues when we don’t have the inclina-\ntion, time, energy, or cognitive resources to undertake a complete ana-\nlysis of the situation. Where we are rushed, stressed, uncertain, indiffer-\nent, distracted, or fatigued, we tend to focus on less of the information\navailable to us. When making decisions under these circumstances, we\noften revert to the rather primitive but necessary single-piece-of-good-\nevidence approach.1 All this leads to a jarring insight: With the sophist-\nicated mental apparatus we have used to build world eminence as a\nspecies, we have created an environment so complex, fast-paced, and\ninformation-laden that we must increasingly deal with it in the fashion\nof the animals we long ago transcended.\nJohn Stuart Mill, the British economist, political thinker, and philo-\nsopher of science, died more than a hundred years ago. The year of his\ndeath (1873) is important because he is reputed to have been the last\nman to know everything there was to know in the world. Today, the\nnotion that one of us could be aware of all known facts is only laughable.\nAfter eons of slow accumulation, human knowledge has snowballed\ninto an era of momentum-fed, multiplicative, monstrous expansion.\nWe now live in a world where most of the information is less than fifteen\nyears old. In certain fields of science alone (for example, physics),\nknowledge is said to double every eight years. And the scientific inform-\nation explosion is not limited to such arcane arenas as molecular\nchemistry or quantum physics but extends to everyday areas of know-\nledge where we strive to keep ourselves current—health, child devel-\nopment, nutrition, and the like. What’s more, this rapid growth is likely\nto continue, since 90 percent of all scientists who have ever lived are\nworking today.\nApart from the streaking advance of science, things are quickly\nchanging much closer to home. In his book Future Shock, Alvin Toffler\nprovided early documentation of the unprecedented and increasing\nrapidity of modern daily life: We travel more and faster; we relocate\nmore frequently to new residences, which are built and torn down moreRobert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 207\nquickly; we contact more people and have shorter relationships with\nthem; in the supermarket, car showroom, and shopping mall, we are\nfaced with an array of choices among styles and products that were\nunheard of the previous year and may well be obsolete or forgotten by\nthe next. Novelty, transience, diversity, and acceleration are acknow-\nledged as prime descriptors of civilized existence.\nThis avalanche of information and choices is made possible by bur-\ngeoning technological progress. Leading the way are developments in\nour ability to collect, store, retrieve, and communicate information. At\nfirst, the fruits of such advances were limited to large organiza-\ntions—government agencies or powerful corporations. For example,\nspeaking as chairman of Citicorp, Walter Wriston could say of his\ncompany, “We have tied together a data base in the world that is capable\nof telling almost anyone in the world, almost anything, immediately.”2\nBut now, with further developments in telecommunication and com-\nputer technology, access to such staggering amounts of information is\nfalling within the reach of individual citizens. Extensive cable and\nsatellite television systems provide one route for that information into\nthe average home.\nThe other major route is the personal computer. In 1972, Norman\nMacrae, an editor of The Economist, speculated prophetically about a\ntime in the future:\nThe prospect is, after all, that we are going to enter an age when\nany duffer sitting at a computer terminal in his laboratory or office\nor public library or home can delve through unimaginable in-\ncreased mountains of information in mass-assembly data banks\nwith mechanical powers of concentration and calculation that will\nbe greater by a factor of tens of thousands than was ever available\nto the human brain of even an Einstein.\nOne short decade later, Time magazine signaled that Macrae’s future\nage had arrived by naming a machine, the personal computer, as its\nMan of the Year. Time’s editors defended their choice by citing the\nconsumer “stampede” to purchase small computers and by arguing\nthat “America [and], in a larger perspective, the entire world will never\nbe the same.” Macrae’s vision is now being realized. Millions of ordinary\n“duffers” are sitting at machines with the potential to present and\nanalyze enough data to bury an Einstein.\nBecause technology can evolve much faster than we can, our natural\ncapacity to process information is likely to be increasingly inadequate\nto handle the surfeit of change, choice, and challenge that is character-\nistic of modern life. More and more frequently, we will find ourselves208 / Influence\nin the position of the lower animals—with a mental apparatus that is\nunequipped to deal thoroughly with the intricacy and richness of the\noutside environment. Unlike the animals, whose cognitive powers have\nalways been relatively deficient, we have created our own deficiency\nby constructing a radically more complex world. But the consequence\nof our new deficiency is the same as that of the animals’ long-standing\none. When making a decision, we will less frequently enjoy the luxury\nof a fully consid-ered analysis of the total situation but will revert in-\ncreasingly to a focus on a single, usually reliable feature of it.\nWhen those single features are truly reliable, there is nothing inher-\nently wrong with the shortcut approach of narrowed attention and\nautomatic response to a particular piece of information. The problem\ncomes when something causes the normally trustworthy cues to counsel\nus poorly, to lead us to erroneous actions and wrongheaded decisions.\nAs we have seen, one such cause is the trickery of certain compliance\npractitioners who seek to profit from the rather mindless and mechan-\nical nature of shortcut response. If, as seems true, the frequency of\nshortcut response is increasing with the pace and form of modern life,\nwe can be sure that the frequency of this trickery is destined to increase\nas well.\nWhat can we do about the expected intensified attack on our system\nof shortcuts? More than evasive action, I would urge forceful counter-\nassault. There is an important qualification, however. Compliance\nprofessionals who play fairly by the rules of shortcut response are not\nto be considered the enemy; on the contrary, they are our allies in an\nefficient and adaptive process of exchange. The proper targets for\ncounteraggression are only those individuals who falsify, counterfeit,\nor misrepresent the evidence that naturally cues our shortcut responses.\nLet’s take an illustration from what is perhaps our most frequently\nused shortcut. According to the principle of social proof, we often decide\nto do what other people like us are doing. It makes all kinds of sense\nsince, most of the time, an action that is popular in a given situation is\nalso functional and appropriate. Thus, an advertiser who, without using\ndeceptive statistics, provides information that a brand of toothpaste is\nthe largest selling or fastest growing has offered us valuable evidence\nabout the quality of the product and the probability that we will like\nit. Provided that we are in the market for a tube of good toothpaste, we\nmight want to rely on that single piece of information, popularity, to\ndecide to try it. This strategy will likely steer us right, will unlikely steer\nus far wrong, and will conserve our cognitive energies for dealing with\nthe rest of our increasingly information-laden, decision-overloaded\nenvironment. The advertiser who allows us to use effectively this effi-Robert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 209\ncient strategy is hardly our antagonist but rather must be considered a\ncooperating partner.\nThe story becomes quite different, however, should a compliance\npractitioner try to stimulate a shortcut response by giving us a fraudu-\nlent signal for it. The enemy is the advertiser who seeks to create an\nimage of popularity for a brand of toothpaste by, say, constructing a\nseries of staged “unrehearsed-interview” commercials in which an array\nof actors posing as ordinary citizens praise the product. Here, where\nthe evidence of popularity is counterfeit, we, the principle of social\nproof, and our shortcut response to it, are all being exploited. In an\nearlier chapter, I recommended against the purchase of any product\nfeatured in a faked “unrehearsed-interview” ad, and I urged that we\nsend the product manufacturers letters detailing the reason and suggest-\ning that they dismiss their advertising agency. I would recommend\nextending this aggressive stance to any situation in which a compliance\nprofessional abuses the principle of social proof (or any other weapon\nof influence) in this manner. We should refuse to watch TV programs\nthat use canned laughter. If we see a bartender beginning a shift by\nsalting his tip jar with a bill or two of his own, he should get none from\nus. If, after waiting in line outside a nightclub, we discover from the\namount of available space that the wait was designed to impress pass-\nersby with false evidence of the club’s popularity, we should leave im-\nmediately and announce our reason to those still in line. In short, we\nshould be willing to use boycott, threat, confrontation, censure, tirade,\nnearly anything, to retaliate.\nI don’t consider myself pugnacious by nature, but I actively advocate\nsuch belligerent actions because in a way I am at war with the ex-\nploiters—we all are. It is important to recognize, however, that their\nmotive for profit is not the cause for hostilities; that motive, after all, is\nsomething we each share to an extent. The real treachery, and the thing\nwe cannot tolerate, is any attempt to make their profit in a way that\nthreatens the reliability of our shortcuts. The blitz of modern daily life\ndemands that we have faithful shortcuts, sound rules of thumb to handle\nit all. These are not luxuries any longer; they are out-and-out necessities\nthat figure to become increasingly vital as the pulse of daily life quick-\nens. That is why we should want to retaliate whenever we see someone\nbetraying one of our rules of thumb for profit. We want that rule to be\nas effective as possible. But to the degree that its fitness for duty is\nregularly undercut by the tricks of a profiteer, we naturally will use it\nless and will be less able to cope efficiently with the decisional burdens\nof our day. We cannot allow that without a fight. The stakes have gotten\ntoo high.210 / Influence\nNOTES\nCHAPTER 1 (PAGES 1–16)\n1. Honest, this animal researcher’s name is Fox.

Although several important similarities exist between this kind of\nautomatic responding in humans and lower animals, there are some\nimportant differences as well. The automatic behavior sequences of\nhumans tend to be learned rather than inborn, more flexible than the\nlock-step patterns of the lower animals, and responsive to a larger\nnumber of triggers.\n4. Perhaps the common “because…just because” response of children\nasked to explain their behavior can be traced to their shrewd recognition\nof the unusual amount of power adults appear to assign to the raw\nword because.\nThe reader who wishes to find a more systematic treatment of Langer’s\nXerox study and her conceptualization of it can do so in Langer (1989).\n5. Sources for the Photuris and the blenny information are Lloyd (1965)\nand Eibl-Eibesfeldt (1958), respectively. As exploitative as these creatures\nseem, they are topped in this respect by an insect known as the rove\nbeetle. By using a variety of triggers involving smell and touch, the rove\nbeetles get two species of ants to protect, groom, and feed them as larvae\nand to harbor them for the winter as adults. Responding mechanically\nto the beetles’ trick trigger features, the ants treat the beetles as though\nthey were fellow ants. Inside the ant nests, the beetles respond to their\nhosts’ hospitality by eating ant eggs and young, yet they are never\nharmed (Hölldobler, 1971).\n6. These studies are reported by Kenrick and Gutierres (1980), who\nwarn that the unrealistically attractive people portrayed in the popular\nmedia (for example, actors, actresses, models) may cause us to be less\nsatisfied with the looks of the genuinely available romantic possibilities\naround us. More recent work by these authors takes their argument a\nstep farther, showing that exposure to the exaggerated sexual attract-\niveness of nude pinup bodies (in such magazines as Playboy and Playgirl)\ncauses people to become less pleased with the sexual desirability of\ntheir current spouse or live-in mate (Kenrick, Gutierres, and Goldberg,\n1989).\nCHAPTER 2 (PAGES 17–56)\n1. A formal description of the greeting-card study is provided in Kunz\nand Woolcott (1976).\n2. Certain societies have formalized the rule into ritual. Consider for\nexample the “Vartan Bhanji,” an institutionalized custom of the gift\nexchange common to parts of Pakistan and India. In commenting upon\nthe “Vartan Bhanji,” Gouldner (1960) remarks:\nIt is…notable that the system painstakingly prevents the total\nelimination of outstanding obligations. Thus, on the occasion of\na marriage, departing guests are given gifts of sweets. In weighing\nthem out, the hostess may say, “These five are yours,” meaning\n“These are a repayment for what you formerly gave me,” and then\nshe adds an extra measure, saying, “These are mine.” On the next\noccasion, she will receive these back along with an additional\nmeasure which she later returns, and so on.\n3. The quote is from Leakey and Lewin (1978).\n4. For a fuller discussion, see Tiger and Fox (1971).\n5. The experiment is reported formally in Regan (1971).\n6. The statement appears in Mauss (1954).\n7. Surprise is an effective compliance producer in its own right. People\nwho are surprised by a request will often comply because they are\nmomentarily unsure of themselves and, consequently, influenced easily.\nFor example, the social psychologists Stanley Milgram and John Sabini\n(1975) have shown that people riding on the New York subway were\ntwice as likely to give up their seats to a person who surprised them\nwith the request “Excuse me. May I have your seat?” than to one who\nforewarned them first by mentioning to a fellow passenger that he was\nthinking of asking for someone’s seat (56 percent vs. 28 percent).\n8. It is interesting that a cross-cultural study has shown that those\nwho break the reciprocity rule in the reverse direction—by giving\nwithout allowing the recipient an opportunity to repay—are also dis-\nliked for it. This result was found to hold for each of the three national-212 / Influence\nities investigated—Americans, Swedes, and Japanese. See Gergen et al.\n(1975) for an account of the study.\n9. The Pittsburgh study was done by Greenberg and Shapiro. The\ndata on women’s sexual obligations were collected by George, Gournic,\nand McAfee (1988).\n10. To convince ourselves that this result was no fluke, we conducted\ntwo more experiments testing the effectiveness of the rejection-then-\nretreat trick. Both showed results similar to the first experiment. See\nCialdini et al. (1975) for the details of all three.\n11. The Israeli study was conducted in 1979 by Schwartzwald, Raz,\nand Zvibel.\n12. The TV Guide article appeared in December 1978.\n13. The source for the quotes is Magruder (1974).\n14. Consumer Reports, January 1975, p. 62.\n15. Another way of gauging the effectiveness of a request technique\nis to examine the bottom-line proportion of individuals who, after being\nasked, complied with the request. Using such a measure, the rejection-\nthen-retreat procedure was more than four times more effective than\nthe procedure of asking for the smaller request only. See Miller et al.\n(1976) for a complete description of the study.\n16. The blood-donation study was reported by Cialdini and Ascani\n(1976).\n17. The UCLA study was performed by Benton, Kelley, and Liebling\nin 1972.\n18. A variety of other business operations use the no-cost information\noffer extensively. Pest-exterminator companies, for instance, have found\nthat most people who agree to a free home examination give the exterm-\nination job to the examining company, provided they are convinced\nthat it is needed. They apparently feel an obligation to give their business\nto the firm that rendered the initial, complimentary service. Knowing\nthat such customers are unlikely to comparisonshop for this reason,\nunscrupulous pest-control operators will take advantage of the situation\nby citing higher-than-competitive prices for work commissioned in this\nway.\nCHAPTER 3 (PAGES 57–113)\n1. The racetrack study was done twice, with the same results, by Knox\nand Inkster (1968). See Rosenfeld, Kennedy, and Giacalone (1986) for\nevidence that the tendency to believe more strongly in choices, once\nmade, applies to guesses in a lottery game, too.\n2. It is important to note that the collaboration was not always inten-\ntional. The American investigators defined collaboration as “any kindRobert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 213\nof behavior which helped the enemy,” and it thus included such diverse\nactivities as signing peace petitions, running errands, making radio\nappeals, accepting special favors, making false confessions, informing\non fellow prisoners, or divulging military information.\n3.

It is not altogether unusual for even some of our most familiar\nquotations to be truncated by time in ways that greatly modify their\ncharacter. For example, it is not money that the Bible claims as the root\nof all evil, it is the love of money. So as not to be guilty of the same sort\nof error myself, I should note that the Emerson quote from “Self-Reli-\nance” is somewhat longer and substantially more textured than I have\nreported. In full, it reads, “A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of\nlittle minds adored by little statesmen, and philosophers, and divines.”\n21. See Zajonc (1980) for a summary of this evidence.\n22. This is not to say that what we feel about an issue is always differ-214 / Influence\nent from or always to be trusted more than what we think about it.\nHowever, the data are clear that our emotions and beliefs often do not\npoint in the same direction. Therefore, in situations involving a decision-\nal commitment likely to have generated supporting rationalizations,\nfeelings may well provide the truer counsel. This would be especially\nso when, as in the question of Sara’s happiness, the fundamental issue\nat hand concerns an emotion (Wilson, 1989).\nCHAPTER 4 (PAGES 114–166)\n1. The general evidence regarding the facilitative effect of canned\nlaughter on responses to humor comes from such studies as Smyth and\nFuller (1972), Fuller and Sheehy-Skeffinton (1974), and Nosanchuk and\nLightstone the last of which contains the indication that canned laughter\nis most effective for poor material.\n2. The researchers who infiltrated the Graham Crusade and who\nprovided the quote are Altheide and Johnson (1977).\n3. See Bandura, Grusec, and Menlove (1967) and Bandura and Men-\nlove (1968) for full descriptions of the dog-phobia treatment.\nAny reader who doubts that the seeming appropriateness of an action\nis importantly influenced by the number of others performing it might\ntry a small experiment. Stand on a busy sidewalk, pick out an empty\nspot in the sky or on a tall building, and stare at it for a full minute.\nVery little will happen around you during that time—most people will\nwalk past without glancing up, and virtually no one will stop to stare\nwith you. Now, on the next day, go to the same place and bring along\nfour friends to look upward too. Within sixty seconds, a crowd of\npassersby will have stopped to crane their necks skyward with the\ngroup. For those pedestrians who do not join you, the pressure to look\nup at least briefly will be nearly irresistible; if your experiment brings\nthe same results as the one performed by three New York social psycho-\nlogists, you and your friends will cause 80 percent of all passersby to\nlift their gaze to your empty spot (Milgram, Bickman, and Berkowitz,\n1967).\n4. Other research besides O’Connor’s (1972) suggests that there are\ntwo sides to the filmed-social-proof coin, however. The dramatic effect\nof filmed depictions on what children find appropriate has been a source\nof great distress for those concerned with frequent instances of violence\nand aggression on television. Although the consequences of televised\nviolence on the aggressive actions of children are far from simple, the\ndata from a well-controlled experiment by psychologists Robert Liebert\nand Robert Baron (1972) have an ominous look. Some children were\nshown excerpts from a television program in which people intentionallyRobert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 215\nharmed another. Afterward, these children were significantly more\nharmful toward another child than were children who had watched a\nnonviolent television program (a horserace). The finding that seeing\nothers perform aggressively led to more aggression on the part of the\nyoung viewers held true for the two age groups tested (five-to-six-year-\nolds and eight-to-nine-year-olds) and for both girls and boys.\n5. An engagingly written report of their complete findings is\npresented in Festinger, Riecken, and Schachter’s (1956) book When\nProphecy Fails.\n6. Perhaps because of the quality of ragged desperation with which\nthey approached their task, the believers were wholly unsuccessful at\nenlarging their number. Not a single convert was gained. At that point,\nin the face of the twin failures of physical and social proof, the cult\nquickly disintegrated. Less than three weeks after the date of the pre-\ndicted flood, group members were scattered and maintaining only\nsporadic communication with one another. In one final—and ironic—dis-\nconfirmation of prediction, it was the movement that perished in the\nflood.\nRuin has not always been the fate of doomsday groups whose predic-\ntions proved unsound, however. When such groups have been able to\nbuild social proof for their beliefs through effective recruitment efforts,\nthey have grown and prospered. For example, when the Dutch Ana-\nbaptists saw their prophesied year of destruction, 1533, pass unevent-\nfully, they became rabid seekers after converts, pouring unprecedented\namounts of energy into the cause. One extraordinarily eloquent mission-\nary, Jakob van Kampen, is reported to have baptized one hundred\npersons in a single day. So powerful was the snowballing social evidence\nin support of the Anabaptist position that it rapidly overwhelmed the\ndisconfirming physical evidence and turned two thirds of the population\nof Holland’s great cities into adherents.\n7. From Rosenthal’s Thirty-eight Witnesses, 1964.\n8. This quote comes from Latané and Darley’s award-winning book\n(1968), where they introduced the concept of pluralistic ignorance.\nThe potentially tragic consequences of the pluralistic ignorance phe-\nnomenon are starkly illustrated in a UPI news release from Chicago:\nA university coed was beaten and strangled in daylight hours near\none of the most popular tourist attractions in the city, police said\nSaturday.\nThe nude body of Lee Alexis Wilson, 23, was found Friday in\ndense shrubbery alongside the wall of the Art Institute by a 12-\nyear-old boy playing in the bushes.216 / Influence\nPolice theorized she may have been sitting or standing by a\nfountain in the Art Institute’s south plaza when she was attacked.\nThe assailant apparently then dragged her into the bushes. She\napparently was sexually assaulted, police said.\nPolice said thousands of persons must have passed the site and\none man told them he heard a scream about 2 P.M. but did not in-\nvestigate because no one else seemed to be paying attention.\n9. The New York “seizure” and “smoke” emergency studies are re-\nported by Darley and Latané (1968) and Latané and Darley (1968), re-\nspectively. The Toronto experiment was performed by Ross (1971). The\nFlorida studies were published by Clark and Word in 1972 and 1974.\n10.

Data of this sort give credence to the claim of some Richard\nNixon backers that the failure that contributed most to the loss of the\n1960 TV debates with John F. Kennedy—and thereby to the elec-\ntion—was the poor performance of Nixon’s makeup man.\n2. See Mack and Rainey (1990).\n3. This finding—that attractive defendants, even when they are found\nguilty, are less likely to be sentenced to prison—helps explain one of\nthe more fascinating experiments in criminology I have heard of (Kur-\ntzburg et al., 1968). Some New York City jail inmates with facial disfig-\nurements were given plastic surgery while incarcerated; others with\nsimilar disfigurements were not. Furthermore, some of each of these\ntwo groups of criminals were given services (for example, counselingRobert B. Cialdini Ph.D / 217\nand training) designed to rehabilitate them to society. One year after\ntheir release, a check of the records revealed that (except for heroin\naddicts) those given the cosmetic surgery were significantly less likely\nto have returned to jail. The most interesting feature of this finding was\nthat it was equally true for those criminals who had not received the\ntraditional rehabilitative services as for those who had. Apparently,\nsome criminologists then argued, when it comes to ugly inmates, prisons\nwould be better off to abandon the costly rehabilitation treatments they\ntypically provide and offer plastic surgery instead; the surgery seems\nto be at least as effective and decidedly less expensive.\nThe importance of the newer, Pennsylvania data (Stewart, 1980) is\nits suggestion that the argument for surgery as a means of rehabilitation\nmay be faulty. Making an ugly criminal more attractive may not reduce\nthe chances that he will commit another crime; it may only reduce his\nchances of being sent to jail for it.\n4. The negligence-award study was done by Kulka and Kessler (1978),\nthe helping study by Benson et al. (1976), and the persuasion study by\nChaiken (1979).\n5.

The insurance sales data were reported by Evans (1963). The\n“mirroring and matching” evidence comes from work by LaFrance\n(1985), Locke and Horowitz (1990), and Woodside and Davenport (1974).\nAdditional work suggests yet another reason for caution when dealing\nwith similar requesters: We typically underestimate the degree to which\nsimilarity affects our liking for another (Gonzales et al., 1983).\n8. See Drachman et al. (1978) for a complete description of the find-\nings.\n9. Bornstein (1989) summarizes much of this evidence.\n10. The mirror study was performed by Mita et al. (1977).\n11. For general evidence regarding the positive effect of familiarity\non attraction, see Zajonc (1968). For more specific evidence of this effect\non our response to politicians, the research of Joseph Grush is enlight-\nening and sobering (Grush et al., 1978; Grush, 1980), in documenting a\nstrong connection between amount of media exposure and a candidate’s\nchances of winning an election.\n12.

In truth, little in the way of combat takes place when the salesman\nenters the manager’s office under such circumstances. Often, because\nthe salesman knows exactly the price below which he cannot go, he\nand the boss don’t even speak. In one car dealership I infiltrated while\nresearching this book, it was common for a salesman to have a soft\ndrink or cigarette in silence while the boss continued working at his\ndesk. After a seemly time, the salesman would loosen his tie and return\nto his customers, looking weary but carrying the deal he had just\n“hammered out” for them—the same deal he had in mind before enter-\ning the boss’s office.\n20.

All of these variations on the basic experiment, as well as several\nothers, are presented in Milgram’s highly readable book Obedience to\nAuthority, 1974. A review of much of the subsequent research on obed-\nience can be found in Blass (1991).\n3. In fact, Milgram first began his investigations in an attempt to un-\nderstand how the German citizenry could have participated in the\nconcentration-camp destruction of millions of innocents during the\nyears of Nazi ascendancy. After testing his experimental procedures in\nthe United States, he had planned to take them to Germany, a country\nwhose populace he was sure would provide enough obedience for a\nfull-blown scientific analysis of the concept. That first eye-opening ex-\nperiment in New Haven, Connecticut, however, made it clear that he\ncould save his money and stay close to home. “I found so much obedi-\nence,” he has said, “I hardly saw the need of taking the experiment to\nGermany.”\nMore telling evidence, perhaps, of a willingness within the American\ncharacter to submit to authorized command comes from a national\nsurvey taken after the trial of Lieutenant William Calley, who ordered\nhis soldiers to kill the inhabitants—from the infants and toddlers\nthrough their parents and grandparents—of My Lai, Vietnam (Kelman\nand Hamilton, 1989). A majority of Americans (51 percent) responded\nthat, if so ordered, in a similar context, they too would shoot all the\nresidents of a Vietnamese village. But Americans have no monopoly\non the need to obey. When Milgram’s basic procedure has been repeated\nin Holland, Germany, Spain, Italy, Australia, and Jordan, the results\nhave been similar. See Meeus and Raaijmakers for a review.\n4. We are not the only species to give sometimes wrongheaded defer-\nence to those in authority positions. In monkey colonies, where rigid\ndominance hierarchies exist, beneficial innovations (like learning how\nto use a stick to bring food into the cage area) do not spread quickly\nthrough the group unless they are taught first to a dominant animal.\nWhen a lower animal is taught the new concept first, the rest of the\ncolony remains mostly oblivious to its value. One study, cited by Ardry\n(1970), on the introduction of new food tastes to Japanese monkeys\nprovides a nice illustration. In one troop, a taste for caramels was de-\nveloped by introducing this new food into the diet of young peripherals,\nlow on the status ladder. The taste for caramels inched slowly up the\nranks: A year and a half later, only 51 percent of the colony had acquired220 / Influence\nit, and still none of the leaders. Contrast this with what happened in a\nsecond troop where wheat was introduced first to the leader: Wheat\neating—to this point unknown to these monkeys—spread through the\nwhole colony within four hours.\n5. The experiment was performed by Wilson (1968).\n6. The study on children’s judgments of coins was done by Bruner\nand Goodman (1947). The study on college students’ judgments was\ndone by Dukes and Bevan (1952). In addition to the relationship between\nimportance (status) and perceived size that both of these experiments\nshow, there is even some evidence that the importance we assign to\nour identity is reflected in the size of a frequent symbol of that identity:\nour signature. The psychologist Richard Zweigenhaft (1970) has collec-\nted data suggesting that as a man’s sense of his own status grows, so\ndoes the size of his signature. This finding may give us a secret way of\ndiscovering how the people around us view their own status and im-\nportance: Simply compare the size of their signature to that of their\nother handwriting.\n7. Subhumans are not alone in this regard, even in modern times. For\nexample, since 1900 the U.S. presidency has been won by the taller of\nthe major-party candidates in twenty-one of the twenty-four elections.\n8. From Hofling et al. (1966).\n9. Additional data collected in the same study suggest that nurses\nmay not be conscious of the extent to which the title Doctor sways their\njudgments and actions. A separate group of thirty-three nurses and\nstudent nurses were asked what they would have done in the experi-\nmental situation. Contrary to the actual findings, only two predicted\nthat they would have given the medication as ordered.\n10. See Bickman (1974) for a complete account of this research. Similar\nresults have been obtained when the requester was female (Bushman,\n1988).\n11. This experiment was conducted by Lefkowitz, Blake, and Mouton\n(1955).\n12.

Without wishing to minimize the advantages of\nthis type of shortcut or the dangers associated with it, I should note\nthat these advantages and dangers are essentially the same ones we\nhave examined in previous chapters. Accordingly, I will not focus on\nthis theme in the remainder of the present chapter, except to say at this\npoint that the key to using properly the shortcut feature of scarcity is\nto be alert to the distinction between naturally occurring, honest scarcity\nand the fabricated variety favored by certain compliance practitioners.\n4. The original reactance-theory formulation appeared in Brehm\n(1966); a subsequent version appears in Brehm and Brehm (1981).\n5. Brehm and Weintraub (1977) did the barrier experiment. It should\nbe noted that two-year-old girls in the study did not show the same\nresistant response to the large barrier as did the boys. This does not\nseem to be because girls don’t oppose attempts to limit their freedoms.\nInstead, it appears that they are primarily reactant to restrictions that\ncome from other people rather than from physical barriers (Brehm,\n1983).\n6. For descriptions of the two-year-old’s change in self-perception,\nsee Mahler et al. (1975), Lewis and Brooks-Gunn (1979), Brooks-Gun\nand Lewis (1982), and Levine (1983).\n7. The occurrence of the Romeo and Juliet effect should not be inter-\npreted as a warning to parents to be always accepting of their teenagers’\nromantic choices. New players at this delicate game are likely to err\noften and, consequently, would benefit from the direction of an adult\nwith greater perspective and experience. In providing such direction,\nparents should recognize that teenagers, who see themselves as young\nadults, will not respond well to control attempts that are typical of\nparent-child relationships. Especially in the clearly adult arena of mat-\ning, adult tools of influence (preference and persuasion) will be more\neffective than traditional forms of parental control (prohibitions and\npunishments). Although the experience of the Montague and Capulet\nfamilies is an extreme example, heavy-handed restrictions on a young\nromantic alliance may well turn it clandestine, torrid, and sad.\nA full description of the Colorado couples study can be found in\nDriscoll et al.

Cialdini Ph.D / 263\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nAn array of people deserve and have my appreciation for their aid in\nmaking this book possible. Several of my academic colleagues read and\nprovided perceptive comments on the entire manuscript in its initial\ndraft form, greatly strengthening the subsequent version. They are Gus\nLevine, Doug Kenrick, Art Beaman, and Mark Zanna. In addition, the\nfirst draft was read by a few family members and friends—Richard and\nGloria Cialdini, Bobette Gorden, and Ted Hall—who offered not only\nmuch-needed emotional support but insightful substantive commentary\nas well.\nA second, larger group provided helpful suggestions for selected\nchapters or groups of chapters: Todd Anderson, Sandy Braver, Catherine\nChambers, Judy Cialdini, Nancy Eisenberg, Larry Ettkin, Joanne Gersten,\nJeff Goldstein, Betsy Hans, Valerie Hans, Joe Hepworth, Holly Hunt,\nAnn Inskeep, Barry Leshowitz, Darwyn Linder, Debbie Littler, John\nMowen, Igor Pavlov, Janis Posner, Trish Puryear, Marilyn Rall, John\nReich, Peter Reingen, Diane Ruble, Phyllis Sensenig, Roman Sherman,\nand Henry Wellman.\nCertain people were instrumental at the beginning stages. John Staley\nwas the first publishing professional to recognize the project’s potential.\nJim Sherman, Al Goethals, John Keating, and Dan Wegner provided\nearly, positive reviews that encouraged author and editors alike. William\nMorrow and Company’s then president, Larry Hughes, sent a small\nbut enthusiastic note that fortified me importantly for the task that lay\nahead. Last and hardly least, Maria Guarnaschelli believed with me\nfrom the start in the book I wanted to write. It is to her editorial credit\nthat the finished product remains that book, much improved. For her\ninsightful direction and her potent efforts in the book’s behalf, I am\nmost grateful.\nIn addition, I would be remiss if I did not recognize the skill and effi-\nciency of Sally Carney at manuscript preparation and the sound counsel\nof my attorney, Robert Brandes.\nFinally, throughout the project, no one was more on my side than\nBobette Gorden, who lived every word with me.\nAbout the Author\nRobert B.
