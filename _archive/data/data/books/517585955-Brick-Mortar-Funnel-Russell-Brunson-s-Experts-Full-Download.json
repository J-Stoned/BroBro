Before  devoting  his full-time work to\nPhysician  In Charge,  Dr. Sewell  successfully  built his own\n7-figure  medical  clinic.  Dr. Sewell  has written  or co-created\nthree anesthesia  textbooks.  In addition  to being  an esteemed\nphysician  by both his patients  and peers,  Dr. Sewell  loves\nmarketing,  business,  and computer  programming.  Before\nattending  the University  of Texas  Medical  Branch,  Dr. Sewell\ngraduated  from the University  of Florida  as their youngest\ngraduate in history at the age of 18.\n| DR. AD AM  SE W EL L  4\nThe 7-Step Framework  To Attract  Your Ideal\nCustomers,  And Create  Your Ideal  Practice\n“You have to make  a choice!”  I vividly  still recall  this conversation  and the ultimatum  from the chief\nanesthesiologist  and my direct  supervisor,  Dr. Evenson.  It was a typical  crazy  day in the operating  room.\nI was about  to put a very sick patient  to sleep  for a high risk surgery  and at the same  time needed  to\nmake  a life-changing  personal  decision.  Dr. Evenson  was pushing  me for an answer.  He wanted  to know\nwhen  I would  be leaving  my full-time job as an anesthesiologist.  In the preceding  three  months,  I had\nbuilt my own clinic  working  nights  and weekends  to see patients.  At the same  time,  I had maintained  a\nfull-time job as an anesthesiologist  taking  a 24-hour overnight  call every  third night.\nI was in a difficult  situation.  The newly -formed  clinic  was not making  any profit.  In fact, the majority\nof my anesthesiologist  salary  was used to pay for the expenses  of my clinic.  From that day forward  I\nneeded  to make  a decision.  The hospital  and the chief  anesthesiologist  knew  I would  likely  soon be\nresigning from my staff anesthesiologist position if my clinic continued to grow. A local physician\nanesthesiologist  was finishing  residency  and wanted  to return  home  to the area to practice.  If I was\ngoing  to leave,  they needed  to hire her before  she accepted  a position  elsewhere.\nThe chief  anesthesiologist  was right.  I could  not continue  to work as a full-time anesthesiologist  and\nrun my full-time practice  for much  longer.  My future  came  down  to this one question:  would  I take the\nrisk of losing  all my money  and savings  to continue  to build  my own medical  practice,  or would  I close\nmy clinic  and stay with my anesthesiologist  job? It was a very lucrative  guaranteed  salary,  but I knew  I\nwould  not be personally  challenged  or experience  personal  growth.\nWhile I was weighing my options, I recalled one of my favorite quotes, “Great ships are safe in the\nharbor, but they are not created to stay in the harbor.” In that moment, I made my decision. I would\ntake the road unknown. That day, I placed my resignation and made a promise to myself: I would  give\neverything  I had to make  the clinic  work,  or I would  die trying.  That day I decided  my fate and destiny\nwould  no longer  be determined  by an employer  or a large hospital  system.\nMy journey  was a long and difficult  one, and I made  many  mistakes  and faced  many  obstacles.  What\nfollows  is my plan for anyone  who might  be in a similar  situation.  Because  you are reading  this chapter,\nnow is the time for you to embrace  your destiny  and head out into the choppy  open seas,  because\ndeep down  you know  you were meant  for more  than the safe harbor.\nThe challenge  that Russell  has set forth  for us is to get 100 new patients  in 100 days or less. Many\nmedical  doctors  starting  their own practice  will finish  their training  and assume  if they hang a shingle\nwith their name  and title outside  a shop,  patients  will come.  For most physicians,  especially  those  in\nmore  populated  settings,  this is not the case.\nMy intention  for this chapter  is to provide  a game  plan that can be used by anyone  who is providing\nexpert  level services,  a proven  game  plan that will work in any market.  Given  that I am a physician  I will\nstart this process  with a scientific  approach.  First I must examine  the challenge.\n100 days is a little more than 14 weeks. I’m going to start by breaking down my tasks by week so I can\n| DR. AD AM  SE W EL L  5\nstart with an overview  of the journey  I will be taking.  I will start by breaking  the 14 weeks  into 7 two-week\nblocks.  Why two-week  blocks?  I want  to set a sustainable  pace where  I can build  and then implement\nthe task at hand.  Like you and most other  physicians,  I’m already  very busy!\nHere is the outline of major tasks that need to happen in each of the 7 two -week blocks:\n• Define  my target  patient  and validate  the market.\n• Build  my message,  and determine  my 3 secrets.\n• Determine  the location  for an event,  and build my presentation.\n• Build  a landing  page and follow -up sequence.\n• Build a follow -up phone  call sequence,  and have the event  day.\n• Schedule  patients  at the event,  and collect  testimonials.\n• Follow -up with attendees  and non-buyers.\nDEFINE MY TARGET PATIENT (PROSPECT)\nThe first step in my process  is to figure  out who exactly  it is I want to recruit  as a patient  to my practice.\nMost physicians and practitioners usually start out with a broad message because they believe they\nwant to ca st a wide net to reach the most patients as possible. For example, an internal medicine\ncollege of mine wanted to recruit anyone who needs healthcare. When you are trying to reach such a\nlarge audience, you can’t speak specifically to anyone. Furthermore, we can’t even define who we  are\ntargeting. Unfortunately, when this is done it doesn’t recruit many people as the messaging from the\nlarge audience  is bland  and does not pertain  to the specific  needs  and emotions  a person  is feeling.\nInstead,  I should  consider  a smaller,  more  specific  audience.  For example,  I could  focus  on patients\nwith thyroid  problems.  Consider  the difference  in who I am trying  to reach:  “everyone  who needs\nhealth  care”  vs. those  that have thyroid  issues.  In this example,  I already  know  that women  are eight\ntimes  more  likely  than men to have thyroid  problems.  (Approximately  one woman  in eight  will develop\na thyroid  disorder  during  her lifetime,  according  to cancer.net.)  I know,  for example,  that I would  be\ntargeting  my messaging  to women  only, and I would  target  my messaging  to the common  symptoms\nof women dealing with thyroid problems such as fatigue, weakness, intolerance to cold, muscle\naches  and cramps,  constipation,  and weight  gain or difficulty  losing weight.  Consider  how difficult\nthese  symptoms  would  be to identify  if I were trying  to reach  “anyone  who needs  health  care”.  What\nsymptoms  would  I discuss?  Well,  technically,  it could  be anything,  and that makes  it difficult  to write  a\ncompelling  message.\nVALIDATE THE MARKET\nFor the sake of this chapter,  I’ll stick with thyroid  patients  for my 100 patient  goal.  My next step is\nto perform  what is known  as “market  validation”.  What  is market  validation  and why do I need to do\nit? Market  validation  is just a fancy  phrase  that means  “checking  out the market  before  I invest  my\nvaluable  time,  energy  and money  into it.” Conducting  market  validation  does not guarantee  that I will\nmake  money  in that market,  but it does decrease  the risk of spending  time,  energy,  and money  on\na market  that doesn’t  work.  With the method  below,  I will show  how to make  sure a market  actually\nwants  what  I’m selling  before  I put my heart  and soul into creating  a product  and offer.  Consider  this\nlike a safety  check  before  I dive into the market.\n| DR. AD AM  SE W EL L  6\nHere are the rules that I am going to live by before I make any offers to a market:\n• Never  create  a product  or offer  unless  I know  there  is demand  for it.\n• It is very risky to be the first person  or only person  in a market.\n• Competition  is a good thing  because  it means  people  are buying  what  I want  to sell.\nIn this day and age, if there’s no one advertising to a market, it’s likely because there is not a market\nthat is interested in it. The other common fear among professionals is that if there are many people\nselling to a market it would be too competitive to enter. The truth is that most markets are nowhere\nnear saturation. If there is a lot of competition, it means that there are a lot of people buying in that\nmarket.\nThe criteria of the market for which I am researching are:\n• The market  must be buying.\n• There  must be lots of people  in the market.\n• Those  people  must be easy to reach  by advertising.\nThe first thing  I will do is use Google  to see if people  are advertising  to this market.  I conduct  a Google\nsearch  for “thyroid  doctor”  and find:\n| DR. AD AM  SE W EL L  7\nI want to focus  on only what paid ads show up in my search  results.  Here in my area,  I can see there  are\nthree  ads just targeting  the keyword  “thyroid  doctor”.\nThere  are a couple  of things  to realize  here.  First,  there  are three  clinics  in the area that are all paying\nfor advertising  for the keyword  “thyroid  doctor”,  and all of them  have dedicated  landing  pages  for just\nthyroid  patients.  This is a really  good sign. The fact that three  local clinics  have taken  the time to dedicate\na page for just thyroid  concerns  indicates  a strong  amount  of traffic  and demand.  I would  review  these\npages  and read the copy of these  pages  carefully.  In this case,  the three  clinics  have almost  identical\ncopy and all lead to either  a phone  number  or a “contact  us” form on their pages.\nNext,  I test other  keywords  such as “thyroid  help”  and “low thyroid.”  In these  cases,  I find the following\nresults:\n| DR. AD AM  SE W EL L  8\nWhat  I see above  is a trend.  As the terms  become  more  generic,  I see offers  for supplements  and a\nfocus  on hair loss. Even though  these  other  businesses  are online  retailers  selling  supplements,  I can\nstill learn  a lot from them.  For example,  I know  that hair loss is likely  going  to be a hot button  topic  I\nshould  consider  including  in my messaging  and future  presentation.\nBased  on the above,  I know  there  is a thriving  market  place  to treat  patients  who have thyroid  issues.\nAdditionally,  I also see that most clinics  are putting  up very similar  information  and driving  potential\npatients  to either  the phone  or to a “contact  us” form.\nWhat can I do to build a relationship with these patients and get them into my clinic now that I know\nthere is a market for them? I start by doing a better job of educating the patient.\nBUILD MY MESSAGE, AND DETERMINE MY 3 SECRETS\nMy next tasks are to build my message  and determine  my “three  secrets”.  Before  I jump  into that, I will\nstart by sharing  how I am going  to build that message.\nEducation -Based Marketing vs. Traditional Marketing\nEducation -based marketing is the sharing of knowledge with the purpose of building trust. It is a\nstrategy  that establishes  credibility  and trust with your customers  by using  educational  messages.\nToday’s  consumer  lives in a highly  digital  and immediately  gratifying  consumer  environment.  They\ndon’t  have to buy unless  it is on their  terms  and their  timetable.\nFurthermore, today’s consumer will not do business with people they don’t trust. In order for them to\ntrust you, they need to be assured  they are dealing  with the right company  who has their best interests\nin mind.\nEducation -based marketing is the direct opposite of traditional marketing, which is done  through\nselling -based  messages  (like what  was seen in my Google  search).  Many  consumers  have had enough\nof traditional  marketing  approaches  and have grown  tired of hearing old and worn  out sales pitches.\nHowever, when important, useful information and facts that help customers make good buying\ndecisions  are shared,  they listen.\nThe challenge  exists  in how to bring  the consumer  to a level of confidence  without  having  to go through\nyears  of trial and error.  This is where  an educational  approach  comes  into the picture  in a very dramatic\nfashion.\nMaintaining an educational presence and relationship with your patients is probably the single most\nimportant element necessary to remain relevant today. Successful marketers want to always be on the\nlookout  for how they can continue  to educate  their existing clients  as well as potential  customers,\nincluding  ways to help them  with their problems  and ways to achieve  their goals.\n3 SECRETS\nOne of the most important  and often  overlooked  concepts  that Russell  Brunson  teaches  is “The Three\nSecrets”.  The Three  Secrets  are focused  around  changing  the belief  patterns  of an individual.  My first\nstep is to identify  my prospective  patient’s  current  beliefs  around  each of the following  areas:\n| DR. AD AM  SE W EL L  9\nInternal Belief Pattern\nThis is a belief  pattern  that the prospective  patient  would  have regarding  themselves.  For example,\nthey may believe  that my solutions  wouldn’t  work for them  as they have tried several  treatment  options\nin the past and those  haven’t  helped  them . One way of combating  such a belief  pattern  would  be a\nstatement about the success of my treatment plans, such as “treatment improves 92% of  patients\neven if other  treatments  have failed  in the past.”  Of course,  this statement  needs  to be true and backed\nby data.\nExternal Belief Pattern\nExternal belief patterns are beliefs that prospects have about how others, external to themselves,\nwould perceive or judge them. A prospective patient may be concerned that others, such as a family\nmember or spouse, would judge them  negatively for trying my services if they didn’t get better. The\nbest way I have found to combat this is to use social proof and testimonials. Additionally, providing\nsome  literature  or a handout  that they can take with them  to help them  explain  why they would  like to\ntry my services  often  helps  them  justify  their decision  to others.\nVehicle Belief Pattern\nThe vehicle  belief  pattern  is the most important  pattern  to address,  especially  in the healthcare  space.  I\nfind that, most often,  patients  have been to a healthcare  provider  and either  had a negative  experience\nor have tried various treatments from other providers or over -the-counter solutions with lackluster\nresults.  My services  need to be presented  as a new opportunity  or a new vehicle  to prospe ctive patients:\nsomething  they have not yet tried which  will turn out differently.\nOnce I have determined my topic and built my three secrets, I will use these in the next step of the\noverall process on my way to obtaining 100 new patients.\nDETERMINE THE LOCATION FOR AN EVENT,\nAND BUILD MY PRESENTATION\nAt this point in the process, I will have determined my target patient, validated the market, built my\nmessage  and determined  my three  secrets.  Up to this point,  primarily  everything  I have done has been\nabstract  or conceptual.  Now comes  what is probably  the scariest  and most exciting  step. This is where\nthe abstract  becomes  a reality.\nI will search  in my area for an event  center.  These  presentations  can be done just about  anywhere:\nchurches,  event  centers,  just about  any place  big enough  for a gathering.  If my office  is large  enough,  I\nwill host it there  as I will also have the added  benefit  of being  local and being  comfortable  with my staff\nnearby.\nWhen  I determine  the location  for my event,  I must also determine  the date and time.  I still remember\nthe first time I did this. I went to an event  center  close  to where  my office  is located  and inspected  the\nmeeting room to make sure it had the AV setup I needed. I remember putting down the deposit and\ncommitting  to the date of my presentation.  When  I walked  out of the office,  it suddenly  hit me. This was\nreal now! I had to make sure everything was ready. Soon I would be standing in front of a room full of\npotential  patients.\nWith live events, timing is everything. It is important to host your events at times that work for your\naudience. In general, the best days for events are Thursday evenings followed by Tuesday evenings.\n| DR. AD AM  SE W EL L  10\nI usually have events start between 6pm and 7pm. Once I have figured out the day and time, it is\nimportant to book my event at least two weeks in advance as I will need time for marketing to build\nup excitement and get potential patients registered for the  event. As a rule of thumb, I like to start\nmarketing about 7 to 10 days before the day of my event.\nThe venue should be comfortable and easy to reach. It should be simple for patients to get to. I will\nplace signs that point to the room throughout the bui lding so the patients don’t have to guess where\nit is being  held.  I will place  lawn signs outside  the building  with the name  of the event  that point  to the\nevent center with arrows as well. As one of my mentors, Dan Kennedy, taught me, “no one ever went\nbroke making  things  easier  for the public.”\nI will also consider  offering  food at my event.  Many  event  centers  offer  catering  and will incentivize  their\ncustomers  (that’s  me!) to order  catering  for their events  by decreasing  the cost of the room  rental.  By\nadding  food to my event,  I will also likely  attract  more  people.  However,  I will also attract  some  people\nthat have no interest  in learning  about  my presentation  and spend  time going  from event  to event\nevery  other  night  looking  for meals.  I would  recommend  offering  a light dinner  or snack  food.\nThe timing of the food is very important. Here are the two schools of thought regarding the timing of\nthe food:\nMake ‘Em Wait so They Stay\nThis is what the majority of presenters do in their events. They start the presentation, and sometime\nduring the presentation they serve food either while they are giving the presentation or stop the\npresentation  for food service.  I find that this interrupts  the flow of the presentation  and the momentum\nthat naturally  occurs  during  the presentation.  Additionally,  I find that when  audiences  are hungry  they\ndon’t focus well. In fact, there have been a few studies on decision making processes and food. One\nsuch study  analyzed  the decisions  made  by judges  and showed  that if a defendant  were to be sentenced\ndirectly  after lunch  the defendant  was far more  likely  to receive  a lighter  sentence  than if the defendant\nis sentenced  another  time during  the day. (Good  to know,  right?)\nFood First Then Presentation\nThis is what I do during my presentation. I have the food ready and available when attendees arrive. If\nsomeone wishes to eat and leave prior to the presentation I am fine with that; I consider it charity.\nThis way, the food service  is out of the way and potential  patients  are fed and are able to focus  on the\npresentation.  Therefore,  they are more  likely  to make  favorable  decisions.\nFinally,  I don’t  think  that if you serve  food or just serve  some  refreshments  such as coffee,  tea, or water\nit will make  that much  of a difference  if you have a great  presentation.\nMy next step is to make  a presentation  worth  seeing.  First,  let me take a step back and get some  clarity\naround  what  I’m aiming  for. Below  there  is a spectrum:\nEducation  Entertainment\n< ----------------------------------------------------- x -------------------------------- ------------------  >\n(Reviewing  Research  Studies)  (Cracking  Jokes)\n| DR. AD AM  SE W EL L  11\nI’m aiming  for my presentation  content  to be something  that is useful,  but not too detailed  or scientific.\nHave you ever been enthralled in a Discovery Channel television show? If you notice, they talk a little\nbit about the science at hand but keep the conversation very high -level and don’t get bogged down  in\nthe research.  I would  consider  this “edutainment”  - interesting,  high-level,  and focused  on the outcome\nfor the  patient.\nBUILD A LANDING PAGE AND FOLLOW -UP SEQUENCE\nNow I have a location  and date set. I’ve built my presentation  which  is part education,  part entertainment.\nI am now ready  to fill my presentation.  So, how do I get people  to my presentation?\nFirst things  first:  I need to build  a landing  page.  Simplicity  is key here.  I want  to provide  some  basic\ninformation  about  my event  and entice  my prospective  patients  to spend  their time.  In my experience,\nthe more  complicated  the landing  page the less likely  it is to be effective.  I want  to keep this simple  and\nto the point.  I will just state  the main premise  that will attract  attention  and share  the 3 secrets  that\nI’ve designed.\nTo start out my page,  I’ll think  about  something  really  attention -grabbing  related  to the example  above\nabout thyroid issues. I’ll think for a second on what people are looking for and what they need. The\nlate Gary Halbert  said that if he could  only have one thing  to build a business  on, it would  be a starving\nmarket. So what are people starving for? As much as I wish I were psychic, I am not. So, I will use Google\nto tell me what people are looking for and then see if it can line up with what I am selling. My favorite\nsearch  phrase  is, “why  can’t  I…?”. Below  is a picture  of the Google  search  I did with this phrase:\nInterestingly,  issues  with your thyroid  can cause  many  of the problems  on the list including  sleep  cycle\nalteration and difficulty losing weight. Sure enough, the top two listings correspond to two very large\nindustries. Since I know that thyroid illnesses are more likely to occur in women (5 to 8 times more\nlikely),  I will go with the weight  loss as this matches  the market  I am serving  a little better.\nNext,  I start to build  a hook.  A hook is something  that would  get the attention  of my prospective  patients.\nIn this case,  that is a female  who is concerned  or already  has a thyroid  disorder.  How could  I phrase\nsomething  that would  get the interest  of my prospect?  The two most common  symptoms  that could\n| DR. AD AM  SE W EL L  12\nindicate that someone has thyroid issues (particularly hypothyroid) are feeling tired and weight gain.\nI’ll use this to make a compelling hook:\n• “Feeling  tired and gaining  weight  even though  you diet and exercise?”\n• “Diet  and Exercise  WON’T  work if you have this condition”\n• “Do you have D.E.R.F.  (Diet and Exercise  Resistant  Fat)?”\n• “If you are tired and can’t  lose weight  .. here’s  why”\nThese  are 4 hooks  that I made  up while  writing  this chapter.  I would  test all of them  and lead them  to a\npage that looks  like this:\nIn the video  on this landing  page I would  explain  the situation  that I believe  my prospect  is in, reiterate\nthe three secrets, and explain the benefits that prospects would gain from attending my event. This\ncould include learning exactly what tests they need to have to determine if they are suffering from a\nthyroid disorder and a simple machine that i s found in the majority of doctors offices that can catch\nan autoimmune attack when it is happening, even if the labs don’t show it yet. I want to give them\nsomething of value and educate them so that even if they don’t buy anything from me, they benefit\nfrom the time they spend  with me.\nNext, I will build some Facebook ads. There are a lot of tutorials on how to build Facebook ads, and it\nis outside  the scope  of this chapter  to walk through  every  detail  of how to build and run Facebook  ads.\nAlso, please realize that if you made it to this point, you can hire out the Facebook ad construction,\nrunning and optimization. Making some useful videos and delivering good information using the hooks\nI made  above  will get me enough  attention  to get some  registrants  for my event.\nNext,  I need to build an email  follow -up sequence  to keep prospects  interested  until the presentation.\nAdditionally, I need to give them an option to go ahead and book an appointment with me before  they\neven come to the presentation . A large percentage of prospects, somewhere between 40 - 60%\n(depending  on the market  and if the services  are covered  by insurance ), will actually  go ahead  and book\nan appointment to come and see you even though they signed up for your presentation, so let  them!\n| DR. AD AM  SE W EL L  13\nFor the follow -up sequence,  the best thing  to do is to keep “edutaining”  the patients  about  why it is\nso important  to treat  an underactive  or overactive  thyroid.  I will teach  them  about  the most common\nsymptoms of having a thyroid problem and explain why sometimes lab tests don’t detect thyroid\nproblems,  especially  cyclical  thyroid  problems.  This will help build  trust with my prospects,  and I can\nreally  help some  people.  This communication  series  is great  for case reports  and testimonials,  so if I\nwill make  sure to include  them  in the communication  if I have them.  I will make  sure that every  time I\ncommunicate  with my prospects  I give them  an option  to reach  out and schedule  an appointment  so\nthey don’t  have to wait for the presentation.\nI also like to have someone  reach  out to patients  that have given  us their numbers  and remind  them  of\nthe upcoming presentation and answer any questions they might have about where the presentation\ntakes place. If they are not sure they can attend, I of course, offer to schedule them an appointment\nright there  on the phone  as well. This usually  works  well and often  I will get quite  a few people  who want\nto go ahead  and make  an appointment  even though  they won’t  be attending  the presentation.\nPRESENTATION TIME\nNow I have registrants, and if I have done everything right, I am starting to get a list of people that\nare going to attend my presentation, a decent portion of whom have already been scheduled for\nappointments. It’s both exciting and scary to see the list  grow.\nWhen it comes time to deliver the presentation, here is the format I would recommend: Explain\nwhat your presentation  is going  to be about  and for whom  it is designed.  For example:\n“Hello, I am Dr. Sewell, and we are going to be talking about the rec ent breakthroughs in  thyroid\ntreatments  tonight.  You are going  to learn  about  the types  of thyroid  issues  that are out there  and what\nare the best treatments  available.”\nI won’t  oversell.  Often  for medical  practitioners  it may feel uncomfortable  to “sell”  or be part of a sales\nprocess. This is not a problem and is normal. After testing this myself, I have found the best place to\ncome from is that of being an educator and just providing information. I don’t believe in putting on\npressure or hard selling anyone. Not only is this cheesy, but it doesn’t create a good physician -patient\nrelationship. While there is something to be said for urgency and scarcity to be used in marketing,  for\nmost medical  professionals  the only scarcity  you need to use is to mention  that your schedule  is filling\nup.\nI’ll make  concepts  easy to understand.  So often  as medical  professionals  we can get into using  our\nlingo,  using  the proper  terms  for everything.  Most people  don’t  understand  medical  terminology.  My\npower  is in my ability  to take the complex  and make  it simple.  The best way to explain  complex  subjects\nis to find a subject  that the patient  would  understand  and make  an analogy.  For example,  your kidneys\nare like filters  cleaning  out the waste  products  in your blood  and eliminating  them.\nIn order  for my presentation  to work,  I will need to make  a call to action.  The best way to make  a strong\ncall to action  is to make  an offer  they can’t  refuse.  To do this, I will think  about  what  my potential  patient\nwould  need.  For example,  tell your prospects  that if they schedule  an appointment  that evening,  they\nwill get everything  they need to evaluate  their thyroid,  including  blood  labs and an ultrasound  scheduled\nso they won’t  have to make  two trips to the doctor’s  office.\nThe final step is to follow  up. Often  potential  patients  who come  across  my presentation  may not take\naction  even though  I made  a really  great  offer.  These  people  that have attended  my presentation  should\n| DR. AD AM  SE W EL L  14\nbe given some type of follow up. It is often quite surprising the length of time potential patients will\nspend  researching  you and the subject  before  taking  action.  The best example  of this I can share  was a\ntime I was once reviewing  the profile  of a patient  who had recently  purchased  a large procedure  at our\nclinic.  I tracked  back to the first time the patient  had come  to our website  and was stunned  to find that\nthe patient  had first visited  our website  more  than 12 months  prior to coming  in for a consultation.  The\npatient  had visited  the site a total of 11 times  prior to engaging  with any of our staff.  The lesson  of the\nstory is: always follow up with leads. You can invite them to other seminars in the future or just  place\nthem  on your list and keep educating  them.\nHere are a couple of other things to keep in mind during this process:\nDone > Perfect\nPeople that are highly technically trained, like physicians, healthcare practitioners and engineers,  are\nespecially  vulnerable  to perfectionism.  Most academic  training  reinforces the idea that your success  is\ndependent  on how close  you can achieve  perfection.  In school,  if you get within  10 points  of perfection\nyou get an “A”, 20 points  you get a “B”, etc. In real life, this is not the case.  In fact, often  the people  that\nare the most successful are those that don’t have all the answers but proceed anyway and are willing\nto fail enough to go forward. Very often we have to silence the voices we have learned to listen to and\nremember our mission is to help others. Are there times where I have made a spelling error in a\ndocum ent or social media post? Yes. Have there been people who have been critical of typos, even my\nown peers?  Yes and yes. The best way to look at this is to realize  two things:\n1. I don’t  listen  to anyone  who isn’t in the arena.  By arena  I mean  someone  who is out there  trying\nto make  something  happen.  If someone  isn’t putting  themselves  out in the public  eye, then\nthey really  don’t  know  what  they are talking  about  and should  not be listened  to.\n2. 99% of the time the person  that is criticizing  you is someone  who has an issue with themselves.\nThe person  who unloads  on your typo with heavy  criticism  would  only do so because  they are\ntrying  to unload  their own issues.\nMarketing for Healthcare Practitioners\nAs a physician  in Russell  Brunson’s  Inner  Circle  I have a unique  perspective.  Understanding  the medical\nsystem and having built, scaled, and sold a medical practice, I can often see how out -of-date we are\nin the medical industry. While technology in medicine has been increasing, we as practitioners have\nlost the art of marketing and self -promotion. We wrongly think that we are above self promotion and\nmarketing, as we think of those terms as negative or slimy. Perhaps we imagine the typical used car\nsalesman in the plaid suit yelling during a TV commercial about low, low prices. Medical marketing\nshould be viewed differently. I look at the way our forefathers used to practice medicine before the\nimplementati on of a mass standard insurance system. The ideals of this generation of physician\nincluded the idea of a community expert role. The local physician was often one trusted source of\ninformation  for the entire  community.\nWhether  you are a physician  or not, the role of healer  is always  open.  A healer  often  facilitates  patients\nhelping  themselves.  Many  times  healers  help patients  deal with difficult  emotions  and help them  see\ntheir challenges  from a new perspective.\nThe role of physician education is very important and has almost disappeared. In an ideal world, a\n| DR. AD AM  SE W EL L  15\nphysician  would  be able to educate  the members  of his community  and people  would  have plenty  of\ntime for get-togethers  and to attend  events.  This is getting  less likely  as the hectic  pace of the average\nAmerican’s  life increases.  Thanks  to technology,  we can fill this role to help the population  and help\npatients  who are suffering  from illnesses  that you can heal.\nMedicine  is being  disrupted.  The future  of healthcare  is around  the corner  with most of the medical\nindustry  undergoing  consolidation.  This is evident  by the expanding  health  care Mega  systems  such as\nBaylor  Scott  and White,  Presbetryian  Health  system,  and Mercy  Health  system  just to name  a few. When\nyou look at the medical  marketplace  it is quite  dated,  the fundamental  way medicine  was practiced  in\nthe 1970s  and 1980s  is still being  practiced  today.  When  you look around  the world  and look at different\nindustries,  every  industry  has been changed  by advances  in technology  and communication  systems.\nHealthcare  is beginning  to see these  changes  take effect  as well.\nNow is the time to take back healthcare.  So often  it is forgotten  that the patients  are what make  up a\nhealthcare  system.  As a physician  or practitioner  it is your job to find your group  of patients  that need\nyour help and then help them.\nIf you are a physician or healthcare practitioner and follow the steps laid out in these pages you will\nfind success,  but more  importantly  you will help a massive  amount  of people.  If you are not a physician\nor practitioner, but are the owner of any brick and mortar business, you can apply the same system  to\nyour business.  It will serve  you as well.\nThe following is the way anyone who has a message can make an impact:\n1. Come  from a place  of caring\n2. Figure  out who you want  to help\n3. Get a message  that resonates  with the person  you want  to help\n4. Determine  how to get that message  to your person\n5. Educate  that person  as if they were your family  member\nSo that’s  it! The above  system  will get your first 100 patients  in the door and set you up for success.\nThe task may seem  daunting,  but remember  that as you work on this challenge,  the challenge  works\non you and gives  you increased  clarity  and the ability  to communicate  with people  who need your help.\nDuring  this process,  realize  that done is better  than perfect,  and expect  to make  a few mistakes.  When\nmistakes  happen,  just laugh  about  them  and move on. Just by reaching  out and helping  people  by\neducating  them,  you will be improving  the world  and healthcare.\n| BR ICK & MOR TAR FU N N E L  S 16\nAlex Hormozi\nCEO of Gym Launch\nAlex Hormozi is the Co -CEO of Gym Launch, a consulting\nprogram  that helps gym owners  achieve  personal  and financial\nfreedom  with sustainable  gym management  processes.\nHormozi’s  leadership  has positioned  Gym Launch  as one of the\nnation’s fastest -growing businesses. Since launching in 2016,\nHormozi  has helped  gym owners  drive more than $1 billion  in\nsales,  led a team of 100+  internal  employees,  impacted  more\nthan 2,000 small business owners, published an industry -\nleading  book,  Gym Launch  Secrets,  produced  a weekly  podcast\nfeaturing  entrepreneurial  insight,  and launched  “Prestige\nLabs,” a Best in Class supplement company.\nGymLaunch.com\n| ALEX  HO R MO  ZI 17\nHow To Get 100 Gym Members  With Only\n$1,000 In Your Pocket In  The Next 100 Days\n2,100 GYM OWNERS CAN’T BE WRONG\nI feel I have an unfair  advantage  being  asked  this exact  question  because  getting  gyms  to full capacity\nis the only thing  my team  and I have done for the last 3 years  at Gym Launch.\nTo us, this question is not hypothetical.\nI was first asked  to speak  at ClickFunnels  4 years  ago as a gym owner  because  I was able to open up\nevery  gym after  my first (I had 6) at full capacity  on the first day using  funnels  and digital  marketing.\nPlus, I was able to do so off of cash flow in under  3 years.\nAfter  selling  my gyms,  we began  flying  around  the country  “launching  gyms”  and getting  each to full\ncapacity  in a month.  We even did the sales for the gyms  we worked  with.  All the while,  we were refining\nthe marketing  and acquisition  processes  so that they would  be bulletproof  across  different  markets\nand countries.\nAfter  documenting  the process  and refining,  our business  exploded.  Today  we have over 2,100  gyms\nwho use our acquisition  system  because  it works . THAT  is the “fill your gym”  acquisition  system  I am\ngoing  to outline  for you in this chapter.\nAdditionally,  I’ll add another  constraint  to the premise  to get 100 customers  in 100 days.  The majority\nof gym owners  we have worked  with only have $1,000  to spend  on advertising .\nSo I am going to show you how we turn $1,000 into 100 customers in 100 days or less .\n| ALEX  HO R MO  ZI 18\nHOW THIS WORKS\nThe cornerstone  of this process,  what  makes  it work,  is something  we call “Client  Financed  Acquisition ”\nwhich  basically  just means  we make  more  at the point  of sale than it costs  to acquire  that customer\nAND THE NEXT. So, the customer who buys gives us enough money to get the next one. Once we\nrecoup  our initial  investment,  it’s essentially  “playing  with the winnings”  and doubling  down.\nIf it costs  me $300 to make  a sale and I make  $1,100  at point  of sale (not including  the customer’s\nlifetime value [LTV] of membership and continuity), then I will be able to spend $300 to get one\ncustomer,  have another  $300 to get the next customer,  and ALSO  have $500 left over to fulfill  services\nand make  a profit.  $300 + $300 + $500 = $1,100.  Again,  this excludes  the lifetime  value  of the member\nas they transition  to continuity.\nThis creates  a virtuous  cycle.  The more  people  we bring  in, the more  money  we have to bring  even\nmore people  in.\nThis is how I would  open all my gyms with no money  down.  I would  let the customers  fund the build out\nof each gym and pay for the staffing for the first 6 weeks before recurring revenue kicked in and took\nover. This is how I scaled from 0 to 6 locations as a 23 year old, in a place I knew no one, in the most\ncompetitive  fitness  market  (southern  California)  in 3 years.\n| ALEX  HO R MO  ZI 19\nWHAT I AM SELLING\nThe single  greatest  advantage  we have as brick & mortar  gym owners  is trust. Use it! Trust means  high-\nticket, high -value  services.\nAnd no, a $130 per month  membership  is not a high-value  service.  It is a commodity.  That’s  why gyms\nstruggle  so much.  They have an undifferentiated  product  which  makes  them  compete  on price.  They\nalso lose customers  left and right because,  well,  easy-in-easy-out.\nWhen you maximize the initial transaction, an agreement is made between both parties that they are\ncommitting. The customer commits to seeing it through, and you commit to giving them an amazing\nexperience.\nBefore I can get started, I need to know what I a m selling and how to maximize the immediate cash\nvalue per customer.\nI do this by not just selling  “the one” thing,  but all the things  that someone  getting  fit might  want.\nHere is a chart  visually  breaking  down  cash value  per prospect  who walks  in the door:\n| ALEX  HO R MO  ZI 20\nHalf the people  are not buying.  That is ok. It would  be better  to close  50% at 5x the price  than 100%\nat 1x the price.\nThis makes  for better  customers,  and most importantly,  gives  me more  profit  to reinvest  in my business\n(or just stack  into my bank account,  which  is kind of the point).\nIn order  to maximize  customer  value,  especially  immediate  cash value,  I need to have a choreographed\nsales process.\nIn my business, we have five sales over a client’s first 6 weeks:\n1. Day 0: Service  Sale\n2. Day 2: Food Sale\n3. Day 16: Supplement  Sale\n4. Day 30:  Commitment\n5. Day 44:  PIF\nNote that they are all spaced  14 days apart  roughly.  Why?  Because  most people  get paid every  14 days.\nI know  what  you are thinking:  FIVE SALES?!?!\nYes, we attempt five sales because:\n• People  like buying  things,  so we let them.  They’re  going  to buy them  anyways,  so they may as\nwell get them  from us.\n• We aren’t selling from our own wallet. Just because you wouldn’t buy fitness services  doesn’t\nmean someone else won’t or values them the same as you. It’s the same reason mechanics\ndon’t  pay for others  to change  their car’s oil. I may not value  it because  I already  know  how to\ndo it, but that doesn’t  make  it not valuable  to others.\n• If there were a way for me to make your life 5x easier, wouldn’t you want me to at least give\nyou the opportunity to decide for yourself? I don’t let my fear of rejection get in the way of\nsomeone else’s  favor.\n• The more  money  I make,  the bigger  I can grow and the more  people  I can help.  Wanting  to stay\nsmall  helps  no one.\nSo, I am able to collect  all these  dollars  in the first 6 weeks  which  is well within  my 100 day window.\nHoorah!  Let me dive into how this is done.\nFirst,  I need to understand  what  I am selling  in order  to know  how I am going  to market  (and make\nmoney doing  it).\nSALE #1: SERVICE SALE\nIn a service sale, the only thing that you have to fulfill is service. The rest of the sales are all add -on\nrevenue streams that I should definitely be capturing.\nWhy do you think  every  athlete  is sponsored?  Brands  value  endorsements  from trusted  sources.  You\nare their trusted  source,  and you should  monetize  these  things.\n| ALEX  HO R MO  ZI 21\nFrom the service angle alone the average gym should sell:\n$149 per week Semi -Private + 1 -1 Accountability/Nutrition\n$99 per week Semi -Private Only\n$99 per week Group Training + 1 -1 Accountability/Nutrition\n$49 per week Group Training Only\n$49 per week 1 -1 Accountability/Nutrition Only\nThis allows  me to sell to the goal of the individual  rather  than fitting  them  into a box.\nIt will allow  me to maximize  the revenue  per customer.\nI will determine for my sale what services my leads need based on what they struggle with: usually\nnutrition, workouts, and accountability. Then I will match my service levels with what they struggle\nwith.  I will determine  how long it will take them  to reach their goal, and then I 2x that to determine  how\nlong it will take them  to maintain  it. Finally,  I will sell them  all of that time up front.\nEXAMPLE:\nMy leads struggle with sticking with stuff. They prefer the group workout environment. The service\nlevel I will pitch is group plus 1 -on-1 accountability for $99 per week.\nIf my lead’s  goal is to lose 50 lbs, I know  that the weight  loss time is 25 weeks  at 2 pounds  per week.\nThen,  I double  that to 50 weeks  total to allow  for metabolism  recovery  and maintenance  time.\n50 Weeks x $99 = $4,950\nI will pitch this offer, but I’ll add a 20% discount if the lead pays in full on that same day and 10%\ndiscount for paying half down.\nEven if they don’t  take that offer,  my price  anchor  is so high, I can downsell  12 weeks  at $1,200,  and it’ll\nfeel practically  free to the potential  customer.\nHere are some benchmarks I’m aiming for:\n• 10 Prospects\n• 5 No Sales\n• 5 Sales\nOf those 5 sales, I’m expecting:\n• 1 Whale  $2,500  Up front  + Continuity\n• 1 Above  Average  $1,200  Up front  + Continuity\n• 3 Normal  Folks $600 Up front  + Continuity\nI have made  $5,500  off 5 sales.  That is an $1,100  average  immediate  cash value  per customer.\nThen,  I set appointments  with each of those  clients  for a nutrition  orientation  24-48 hours  later.\n| ALEX  HO R MO  ZI 22\nSALE #2: FOOD\nThis is where  I onboard  the client,  set the schedule,  assign  trainers,  go over eating  habits,  and depending\non the promotion  they came  in for, give them  a starter  meal plan of some  sort.\nOnce that occurs, I will be able to sell 60 - 80% onto some sort of meal delivery service.\nTo facilitate  this, my company  made  Done-For-You Meals  to ship fresh  meals  out to our gym owners’\ncustomers  nationally.  We did this so our gyms  didn’t  have to deal with a local guy who is inconsistent,\ncan’t  track  and doesn’t  pay out commissions  aggressively.  This will make  the gym on average  an extra\n$110 per month per customer who takes the offer.\nAre you noticing  how we are blowing  the standard  $130 per month  out of the water?  It’s all because  we\nare providing  more  value  and solving  more  problems.\nSo let’s be conservative  and say 60% of new customers  (3 out of 5) at my gym take my offer  of meal\ndelivery.  I’m going  to get $110 x 1.5 (6 weeks)  x 3 Customers  = $165 x 3 = $495.\nThis gives me another $100 pure profit per sale, increasing my $5,500 to $5,995.\nSALE #3: SUPPLEMENTS\nPeople  who run businesses,  not passion  projects,  are always  happy  to sell supplements.  Why?  Business\nowners  don’t  ignore  data.\n75%+ of USA residents  buy supplements.  They are going  to buy them  anyways,  and your philosophical\nissues will never overshadow the fact that when someone spends more money, they are more\ninvested.  Period.  The more  invested  they are, the more  likely  they are to succeed.  As coaches,  it’s our\nresponsibility  to use every  tool in our arsenal  to get our clients  great  results.\nTypically,  4 of 5 buyers  will buy supplements.  Based  on our average  stats at Prestige  Labs,  the average\nsale is $225 per month  on continuity.  Payouts  on that are roughly  $100 per month.\n$100 x 2 Months x 4 Clients = $200 extra profit per sale, increasing my $5,995 to $6,995.\nSALES #4: 12 -MONTH COMMITMENT\nThis sale would only apply to people who were downsold in the beginning: the 3 people who may not\nhave opted for continuity right off the bat, and just want to start with 6 weeks, 4 weeks, etc.\nThis is where I recap their goal. I explain to them that there  is no way they will accomplish what they\ncame  in for in the next “X” weeks.  I give them  an offer to commit  to the year, get a discounted  rate just\nfor making  the commitment,  and for doing  that, I can give them  a guarantee  around  results.\nI do this to make sure that everyone gets on continuity and to also set up sale #5.\nSALE #5: PAID IN FULL\n14 days later,  20%-30% of clients  will take an offer  to save some  money  and pay in full for the year. It\nhinges  on the fact that they are already  committed  to making  the payments,  so they might  as well save\n| ALEX  HO R MO  ZI 23\nthemselves  some  money.  This will be the fourth  meeting  they have had with me, so this meeting  should\nbe primarily  providing  value.\nAt the end of it, I simply  ask if they knew  about  my “Year of Change”  program.\nThey will say  no.\nThen I will say:\nSince you already locked in your 12 -month commitment, if you want, you can do what a\nlot of our members do to save money and join the Year of Change program. I think you\nwould  be a good fit for it. Our year of change  clients  get the best results  and it’s better\nthan free. You actually  save $500-$1000  if you want to pay in full today.  Just gives us less\nadmin  work and it’s easier  on the wallet  for you. It would  lower  your effective  rate to XX.\nYou wanna do  that?\nIt’s a very low key sale. At this point, I should have a lot of rapport and trust with this person.\nClients  who pay in full churn  less, refer more,  cost less to fulfill,  tend to be more  engaged  and also tend\nto be higher  participants  in upsells  and cross -sells.\n1 out of 5 buys a $2,000  sale.\nThis adds another  $400 per sale in up front  cash,  taking  my $6,995  to $8,995  in revenue from five\nsales within  the first 6 weeks.\nSUMMARY OF WHAT I AM SELLING\nI’ve covered a lot so far, but what does this have to do with getting people into my gym?\nIn short: everything.\nIn the famous words of the late Dan Kennedy,“he who can spend the most to acquire a customer, wins.”\nThis sales conversion  process  allows  you to take any promotion  and maximize  immediate  cash value,\nwhich,  especially  for people  who don’t  have a lot of money  in their pocket,  is how you win.\nBased on perfect execution, I would make ~$1,100 per client in immediate cash value and $1,799 per\nclient in the first 6 weeks.\nCompare this to most of my competitors who are giving away a free month then only making $135.\nThey make  $135 in 6 weeks  while  I’m making  $1,799.  It’s not even close.  That is how our gyms  make\nmoney  acquiring  new customers,  make  enough  to acquire  the next customer , and have plenty  left over\nto stack  cash.\nThe reason  our gyms  have been able to grow so big so quickly  is because  they can spend  whatever\nthey want  in the acquisition.\nGetting customers is no longer the bottleneck in the business on my quest to get 100 new clients in\n100 days with less than $1,000 initial investment.\nFor those  of you who think  “no one in my market  would  spend  that”,  I probably  have 5 gyms  in your\nmarket,  and people  are indeed  spending  that and more.\n| ALEX  HO R MO  ZI 24\nWHAT WOULD I DO? THE STEP -BY-STEP OF OBTAINING CLIENTS\nNow that I know  I can sell anyone  who comes  in the door on a service  package  that will solve  their\nproblem  (not just the promotion  they came  in for) and a number  of cross -sells they will value,  there  are\na number  of different  promotions  that work.\nThe equation is determining how much I can pay in total for all of the following to occur:\n• Ad Gets Impressions  (aka eyeballs)\n• Click\n• Opt-In\n• Schedule\n• Show\nNow that I know  how much  I make  in immediate  cash value  (~$1,100  per sale),  I need to determine  how\nmuch  I can pay per show .\nIf I am the average gym owner and close 50%, then I make $550 per show.\nThis means  I could  spend  $275 per show  and have enough  money  to acquire  that customer  and the\nnext.\nThat would  be the max amount  I could  pay. Anything  under  that,  and I’m taking  home  money  on top of\ngetting  new customers  to buy us more  customers.\nI will reverse engineer the numbers:\n$275 PER SHOW\n70% SHOW\n$192 PER SCHEDULE\n70% SCHEDULE\n$134 PER OPTIN/LEAD\n30% OPT-IN\n$40 PER  CLICK\nIf I am maintaining  a cost of under  $40 per click,  I am winning  and getting  free customers  into my gym.\nHoorah!  By the way, that happens  a lot. These  are my MAXes.\nSo what does the process look like?\n| ALEX  HO R MO  ZI 25\nSTEP ONE : Ad Gets Impressions (a.k.a. eyeballs)\nTo make this easier, I have a visual that gives all the variables for making a campaign for your gym:\n| ALEX  HO R MO  ZI 26\nI am going  to use a combination  of these  things  that have been found  to work best.  You will constantly\nneed to vary the promotions  to keep things  fresh,  and so I will likely  launch  multiple  promotions  of\nsimilar  duration  to see which  headlines  work best,  like:\n• 28-Day Bikini  Blueprint\n• 6-Week Mommy  Makeover Challenge\n• 42-Day Detox\nHere is example copy I might use:\nHi, my name  is Alex.  I just opened  my gym around  the corner  from you. That means  if you\nare seeing  this, you are awesome.\nClick here if awesome: LINK\n...and  to commemorate  how awesome  you are, and the opening  of my new gym, I am\ngiving  INSANE  rates  away  so I can cover  my new rent.\n(sweating emoji faces)\nI will be giving  a “founders  discount”  on training  to my first 20 new customers  so that I can\ncover  my rent.  #realtalk\nAnd I need to do this FAST! :)\nIf the link still works, then there are still spaces.\nI will honor the commitment if you opt -in before I end it.\nIf you are interested,  I’m giving  my 28 Day Bikini  Blueprint  to all new customers.  Which  I\nhave never done befor e.\nIf you want in:\n1. Click here:  LINK\n2. Opt-in\n3. Schedule  A Time  To Come  in\n4. Keep being  awesome.\nPS - you should  click the link and sign up. The deal will expire,  and I’ll go back to normal\nrates  soon.  Which  are exorbitantly  expensive.  :P\nPPS - I will also text you to confirm  your appt,  so don’t  be frightened.  I’m a normal  guy, and\nI am afraid  of spiders  like every  other  sane person.\nSimple enough?\nThe image may be a picture of me waving and making a funny face, a picture of me with clients, or a\nvideo of me training clients all together in unison.\nThe combinations are limitless.\n| ALEX  HO R MO  ZI 27\nSTEP TWO : Build a Simple 3 -Step Funnel\nOnce a lead clicks, they then go to a simple 3 -step funnel:\nHere are the funnel steps:\n• Step 1: They opt in.\n• Step 2: They land on a ‘scheduling  page’.  I want  to make  3 - 8pm available  for sales consults\nMonday  through  Friday  and 9am - 12pm  Saturday.  Yes, even Friday.  It’s proven  to be one of the\nhighest  closing  percentage  days.\n• Step 3: Leads  are re-routed  to a free Facebook  group  where  they can be given  content  for free\nand get to know  me better.\nAt this point,  I now have a certain  percentage  of leads  who opted  in and scheduled,  and others  who did\nnot schedule.\nI treat  them  both the same.  Why?  People  don’t  show  up to appointments  just because  they scheduled\na time.  They need someone  to reach  out, confirm  their time and get them  excited  to come  in. People\nare intimidated  to come  into the gym. It’s the same  reason  they haven’t  been in to work out in a few\nyears.  So, they need a little  love.\nMy best practice  is to “double  dial” (call the same  number  2x in a row),  then follow  up with a text. I do\nthat 3x per day for each lead.\nSpeed  is king with working  leads.  The faster  you get in contact  and confirm  their appointment  (also\nmake  them  laugh,  compliment  them),  the more  likely  they are to show  up and buy.\nThis is all there is to it:\n• Place the  ads.\n• Point them  to the funnel.\n• Work the leads.\n• Get them  in.\n• Sell them the  dream.\n| ALEX  HO R MO  ZI 28\nSTEP THREE : Rinse and repeat this process until my gym is full\nWhen I spend $1, I am aiming to make $3.\n• $1 goes to pay back the advertising.\n• $1 goes to getting  the next customer.\n• $1 goes to the bank.\nThe more  I spend,  the more  I make.  Shrewd  investors  know  that if they can get 2:1 returns  in a 30 day\nwindow,  they would  be jumping  for joy. This allows  you to do that and so much  more.\nThe biggest difference between our top gyms and our struggling gyms is how much they spend.\nThey understand if they get 3:1 on their ad spend, they will make $30,000 if they spend $10,000 and\ntherefore net $20,000 in the acquisition of a new customer .\nThe struggling gyms fail to do this. They spend $1,000, make $3,000 and the $2,000 leftover gets\neaten up by other business costs. They fail to take advantage of absolute margins.\n#limitlessleads\nBest of luck and happy hunting!\n| BR ICK & MOR TAR FU N N E L  S 29\nAndrew  Argue\nCEO of AccountingTax.com\nAndrew  Argue,  CPA is the CEO of AccountingTax.com\nand has helped  over 7,000 accountants acquire\nclients,  provide  higher  value  services,  and build\nteams  to deliver  exceptional  client  service.\nAccountingTax.com\n| ANDR E W AR G UE 30\nHow To Attract  100 Clients  In 100 Days\nUsing  Your “New  Opportunity”\nThe biggest problem most accountants have is their offer. They’re offering “tax preparation and\nbookkeeping”.\nBookkeeping and tax preparation are not interesting to most small business owners. They dread it.\nThey see it as a cost. They resent it.\nThey need something new. A “new opportunity.”\nTherein  lies your “Free  Tax Assessment  Funnel”,  which  is the method  I would  use to get 100 new clients\nin 100 days using  ClickFunnels.\nAs an accountant, I have to switch my mindset. I’m no longer marketing compliance. I’m marketing\nvalue . When I sit down with a small business owner for 30 to 60 minutes, I should ask them a ton of\nquestions about:\n• Deductions\n• Legal Entity  Structure\n• Retirement\n• Insurance\n• Loopholes\n• Tax Cuts & Jobs Act Updates\n• Niche  Strategies\n• Advanced  Strategies\nIn that one hour call, I should be able to give them:\n• Prior year estimated  overpayment\n• Current  year estimated  overpayment\n• Future  years  estimated  overpayment\nNow, I can sense some readers are already in a panic. Rightfully so. This strategic shift means you’re\ngoing  to have to focus  mostly  on “business  owners”  not the run-of-the-mill 1040 clients  you might  have\nbeen used  to.\nWhile  marketing  ‘tax planning’  does work for individuals,  the opportunities  for business  owners  are far\nbetter.\n| ANDR E W AR G UE 31\nLet’s start off with who I actually need to target, the persona, to make this strategy work:\n• Business  owners  => individuals\n• 250-500k+  revenue  => people  starting  out\n• Local  ads to general  businesses  or niche  ads across  the country\nWhat I am offering is a 45-minute free tax assessment. I will give them an estimated savings on the first call.\n(Yes, even if I were a bookkeeper, CFO, or had never done tax planning before in my life. Contrary to\npopular  belief,  you do not need a license  to do tax planning  or tax preparation.  Not a CPA license.  Not\nan Enrolled  Agent.  Not even a college  degree.)\nAt the end of that call, I want  to give my lead an estimated  savings  for prior year, current  year, and\nfuture tax  years.\nWhatever  the current  year estimated  savings  is, I’ll take 30% of that estimated  savings  as a tax planning\nfee (generally  $2,500  to $9,800).  That’s  just the first service.\nAfter that, I’m going to upsell them into other services including:\n• Tax Preparation\n• Accounting,  Controller,  Chief  Financial  Officer  Services\n• Wealth  Management\n• Other commissionable  services\nThe switch from marketing ‘compliance’ to this more strategic model is night and day. If you stick to\nbasic services, your lifetime value of the client is $15,250 over 5 years.\nWhen  you choreograph  the experience  from the free tax assessment  and ascend  your clients  into a\nmultitude  of other  services,  you maximize  the value  of that client  10 to 20 fold.\nWhile not every client will use all the services, the principle of starting with planning makes all the\ndifference.\nHere’s  an example  of two accountants  serving  the same  client  who might  benefit  differently  by using\nthe two methods:\nThe Client Pays For...  “John Smith”  Accountant  The New  You\nTax Plan  – $16,000 ($22k saving -$6k fee)\nBusiness Preparation  $650  $2,000 (min.)\nIndividual Preparation  $350  $1,000 (min.)\nImplementation  – $1,000 (min.)\nAccounting, CFO  $2,400 (bookkeeping)  $12,000 (min.)\nTotal Cost  $3,400  (Free)\nAccountant Fees  $3,400  $22,000\n| ANDR E W AR G UE 32\nIn this example, I’m charging 640% more than “John Smith” accountant who is still marketing\ncompliance to his audience.\nThe key to this entire  strategy,  though,  is that the client  doesn’t  care about  the additional  cost because\nI have saved  them  $22,000  in taxes  (in the example  above).\nYes, I am charging  them  $22,000,  but that makes  the process  break  even for the client.  John Smith  is\nstill charging  them  $3,400,  so his services  are seen as a cost - an expense.\nThat’s  how most small  business  owners  view their accountants:  as a cost center.  For that reason,  they\nconstantly  want  to chip away  at my fees or ask more  of me for the same  fee.\nThis new way to market my services is to become a profit center .\nI want  to start off the engagement  by making  or saving  the client  money  instead  of providing  just a\nservice.  Services  are commodities,  but outcomes  are invaluable.\nThe key, though,  is to provide  tangible  and specific  value  to the client  in the first engagement  so they\nrecognize  my worth.  This allows  me to charge  more  for every  single  engagement  I offer  in the future.\nNow, why is all this being shared in a book about ClickFunnels?\nWell, here’s  the thing.  If I’m only charging  $250 to complete  a 1040 tax return,  I can’t  spend  time and\nmoney  on marketing.  I’m not providing  much  value,  and I don’t  have a high lifetime  value  of the client.\nBut, once my clients’ lifetime value starts to grow, you can spend money on advertising.\nHere’s  an example  of one of my clients  spending  $30-40 per day after  just a few weeks  of launching\ntheir ClickFunnels  Tax Planning  Funnel:\nTotal Spend: $2,774.44\nClicks: 532 ($5.21)\nLeads: 94\nCost Per Lead: $29.52\nStrategy Session: 52\nCompleted Appointments: 26\nSold: $19,750 - 6 unique tax plan clients (What service? Are there more services?).\nCash Collected: $17,650\n711% ROI, $16,976 to break even “houses money”\n| ANDR E W AR G UE 33\nThis is just on the first service. She went on to upsell two clients in these ways:\nFirst client:\n$2,700  Tax Plan\n$7,000 Tax Prep\n$26,000 Annual Recurring Accounting\n= $35,700 Y1 Fees\nSecond Client:\n$7,000 Tax Planning\n$3,750 Onboarding Fee\n$4,000 Tax Prep\n$30,000 Annual Recurring Accounting\n= $41,750 from just two clients!\nThat’s a total of $77,450 from just 2 clients!\nAll of this revenue  was generated  from a few thousand  dollars  in advertising  spend  to drive  traffic  to\nher ClickFunnels  landing  pages.\nIf you were only selling  1040 services,  you could  have only sold less than a dozen  clients  at $250 each\nand broken  even on your ad spend,  leaving  no profit.\nWhen you make the switch to “Free Tax Assessments,” you can afford to market and start serving\nclients at the highest levels!\nHere is a closer look at the funnel:\nFacebook  Ads ClickFunnels  Tax Plan\nAttract  Engage  Acquire\nWe use Facebook Ads to drive targeted traffic to a ClickFunnels landing page.\nLeads  opt-in for a “Free  Tax Assessment”  and schedule  an appointment  on the scheduling  calendar.\nThis calendar  is embedded  onto the page from our scheduling  software.\n| ANDR E W AR G UE 34\nOnce we have that appointment, we perform an education -based sales consultation and close the\nclient on a tax plan.\nBAM!\nIf you’re starting over and looking to get as many clients as possible as a tax or accounting firm:\n1. Switch  to serving  business  owners.\n2. Switch  to tax plans  as the first offer.\n3. Launch  Facebook  ads to a ClickFunnels  page.\n4. Perform  a “Free  Tax Assessment”  and close  a tax plan.\n5. Upsell  clients  into other  services.\nDo that, and you’ll knock the socks off the competition and have 100 new clients in no time!\n| BRICK & MOR TAR FUN N EL  S 35\nDr. Anissa  Holmes\nFounder of Delivering  WOW\nDr. Anissa  Holmes,  a Dentist,  Business  Acceleration  Coach,\nSocial  Media  Strategist,  and Best Selling  Author,  is a leader\nin the dental  industry.

ANIS S A HOLME  S 36\nUsing Dental Marketing Funnels To\nGenerate  A Steady Flow Of New Patients\nNot too long ago, dental practices only used traditional sources of advertising to attract clients. They\nwould place an ad in a newspaper or phone book. They put together a local radio or TV ad. They sent\ndirect  mailers  to people  who lived near their office.  Aside  from these  methods,  practices  asked  patients\nfor referrals  to friends  and family  or collaborated  with local businesses  to promote  each other.\nFor many  years,  I used these  traditional  methods  to market  my practice,  too. Although  those  traditional\nmethods  were helping  me attract  patients,  I had a much  bigger  vision  for my practice  than just another\ndental  practice.  I wanted  more  for my patients,  team  members,  and myself.  I wanted  more  for my\nfamily.  I had a big vision.\nUsing Dental Marketing Funnels to Fulfill My Big Practice Vision\nI wanted to build a profitable dental practice that delivered such WOW experiences that patients\nactually looked forward to their next appointment. I wanted to build a workplace that attracte d and\nretained  the best team  members,  and I wanted  to build a practice  that could  operate  just as profitably\nwithout  me working  as it did when  I was physically  there.  I wanted  to take vacations  and attend  dance\nrecitals,  sports  events,  and school  plays.\nTo help me design and implement a plan to achieve that vision, I went outside of the dental world and\nhired a premier business coach to work with me over a year. Throughout that year, we worked on\nredesigning everything from operations to the patien t experience to become the #1 dental practice\nknown  for “Delivering  WOW.”\nFrom delivering  WOW  experiences  to patients  to breaking  the traditional  marketing  mold,  my coach\nand I redesigned  every  part of my practice.  The results  were nothing  short  of extraordinary.  Profits\nsoared.  Patients  raved,  and we set up our team  members  to succeed.\nAlthough we revolutionized operations and patient experiences, the most impactful changes we  made\nwere how we marketed our practice. We transitioned from traditional marketing to online marketing,\nand our results  were fast and furious.\nWe no longer  had to spend  thousands  of dollars  and wait weeks  or months  for an ad to run. Instead,  we\ncould reach thousands of potential patients for pennies. Using Facebook marketing, we could get the\nphone  to start ringing  in a matter  of minutes  or hours.\nEven better, we could set up a series of automated messages delivered using ClickFunnels pages\nand email sequences to nurture relationships with potential patients. Those sequences answered\nfrequently  asked  questions,  showed  potential  patients  what  makes  our practice  different  from others,\nand gave potential  patien ts a glimpse  into who we are.\nWe could  build  relationships  with people  that were much  deeper  than a traditional  ad could  ever do.\nIn answering  questions  and nurturing  relationships  automatically,  we could  spend  less time on the\n| DR. ANIS S A HOLME  S 37\nphone  with prospects,  too. Our automations  also filtered  out people  who were not patient  candidates\nwhile  funneling  to our practice  those  who were right for us. Even better,  when  people  made  it through\nour funnels,  they already  knew,  liked,  and trusted  us, making  it much  more  likely  that they would  move\nforward  with the treatment  plans  we recommended.\nHelping Other Practices Attract New Patients on Autopilot\nAfter  mastering  the art and science  of using  Facebook,  followed  by automated  sequences,  my team\nand I started  helping  other  practices  do the same.  We helped  everything  from start-up practices  to\nones that have been operating  for decades.  The results  were the same.\nWith the right systems, processes, and marketing, any brick and mortar business can use Facebook and\nfunnels to attract a steady flow of new, ideal patients or clients on just a few dollars a day. In fact,\nmany of my clients get better results on a $500 monthly marketing budget with Facebook ads and\ndental marketing funnels than they did when they spe nt thousands of dollars every month on traditional\nadvertising.\nGetting 100 New Patients in Just 100 Days: A Four -Phase Approach\nIf I needed  to generate  100 new patients  in just 100 days,  I would  use the same  four-phase  process  I\nhave used for my practice  and with thousands  of others.\nThe first phase  would  last 45 days,  during  which  I would  focus  on building  relationships  with potential\npatients  and other  local businesses,  setting  up our advertising  audiences  for future  efforts,  and training\nmy team  to convert  leads  into patients.\nThe second phase would run from day 46 through day 50. During these days, I would run three\ncampaigns. Each campaign would promote one procedure that is proven to attract new patients,\nincluding  cavity  risk assessments,  Invisalign,  and dental  implants.  The campaigns  would  direct  people\ninto a simple  dental  marketing  funnel  designed  to help them  understand  whether  they are a candidate\nfor the procedure.  It would  also give people  an opportunity  to schedule  an appointment  or learn  more\nabout  the procedure  while  being  added  to an audience  for future  advertising  efforts.\nThe third phase  would  run from day 51 through  day 80. During  this phase,  I would  introduce  additional\ncampaigns  to nurture  relationships  we built during  the first two phases.  As with the earlier  phases,  I\nwould  continue  to evaluate  performance  and identify  ways to improve.\nThe fourth  phase  would  run from day 81 through  day 100. By this time,  my ads would  be performing\nwell,  and my dental  marketing  funnels  would  be answering  all the frequently  asked  questions  and\nbuilding  strong  relationships  with the leads  generated  in the earlier  phases.\nHere is the step -by-step process I would use to generate at least 100 p atients in 100 days.\nPHASE 1: Building A Warm Audience For Facebook Ads (Days 1 –45)\nDuring the first forty -five days, I would focus on four key activities:\n• Running a community -engagement campaign with local businesses where I give away gift\ncards  from local businesses  on social  media.\n| DR. ANIS S A HOLME  S 38\n• Running a smile makeover competition, where I generate buzz through giving away a life-\nchanging  smile  transformation  to one person  in need.\n• Setting up Facebook marketing “retargeting” audiences, which are saved audiences in\nFacebook’s  advertising  platform  that places  ads to people  who have engaged  with my practice’s\nonline  platforms.\n• Training  my team  on using  the phone  to convert  leads  generated  from our phase -one activities\ninto new  patients.\nHere is how I would implement each of these four activities:\nRunning a Community -Engagement Campaign with Local Businesses\nRunning  a community -engagement  campaign  with local businesses  helps  establish  partnerships  with\nlocal businesses,  builds  a common  goal for my team,  and generates  big, warm  advertising  audiences\non Facebook  and Instagram  to use in the future  for digital  marketing  campaigns.\nBy building  warm  audiences,  I can get more  people  to respond  to future  ads because  the people  seeing\nmy ads will already  know  me. Thus,  I get a higher  percentage  of people  to respond.\nAdditionally,  the cost I pay to Facebook  when  using  a warm,  retargeting  audience  for my ads will be\nmuch  lower  than when  I send ads to cold audiences  I put together  based  on demographics  alone.\nAs a result,  with retargeting  audiences,  I get better  results  at a lower  cost. Here is a step-by-step\nprocess  for running  an effective  community  engagement  campaign.\nFirst,  I make  a list of local businesses  in my community  that I can partner  with on a gift card giveaway.\nMy goal is to get twelve  local businesses  to donate  a gift card so that I can give away  one gift card a day\nfor twelve  days.  Ideally,  these  businesses  would  have a large  social  media  following  of their own.\nWith the help of my team,  I reach  out to these  businesses  and ask them  to donate  a gift card that can\nbe given  away  in a community  social  media  campaign.  The business  will get social  media  exposure  as\nthey will be tagged  in my Instagram  and Facebook  posts  during  the campaign.\nThe process  of procuring  these  gift cards  should  take no more  than a week  (Days  1 - 7).\nHere is the script  my team  uses when  requesting  prizes  from local businesses.\nSubject: Re: Collaboration to Increase Your Social Media Following & Give Back to\n<community name here>\nDear <contact name>,\nHi, I’m Dr. from <practice name>, and we love to give back to and engage with our\ncommunity.

ANIS S A HOLME  S 40\nWhen  I reach  out to local businesses,  I always  get more  than enough  gift cards  to use for our giveaway.\nLocal  businesses  get promoted  by my firm without  having  to do anything  other  than donate  a gift card.\nOnce  I collect  the gift cards,  the next twelve  days (Days  8 - 19) will be spent  running  my giveaway  on\nFacebook.  Here are the action  items  I will complete:\n• Give away one prize (gift card)  each day.\n• Do a Facebook  Live video  announcing  the campaign  on Day 8. In the video,  I let people  know\nI will be giving  away  a gift card to local businesses  every  day for the next twelve  days,  starting\nthat day.\n• Edit the Facebook  post (once  the video  is complete)  using  the language  below  for my post.\n• Announce  the winner  of the prize  on Facebook  Live video  the following  day. Let people  know  to\nlook for that day’s  giveaway  on that video.\n• Use an image  post to start that day’s  giveaway  in a separate  post.  Generally,  to be eligible\nto enter,  I ask people  to share  the post and comment  with something  specific,  such as their\nfavorite  food,  best vacation  spot,  or a specific  word or phrase.  This helps  improve  engagement\non the post so it is shown  in more  people’s  feeds.\nHere is language I will modify, then post for my Facebook Live announcing the giveaway campaign:\n🎉 Our 12-Day [Name  of Month]  GIVEAWAY  is here!\n🎉 Don’t  miss your chance  to win BIG! 🎁🎁\nDAY 1: Today our prize is a [Enter Prize] from [Enter Company]! 👜\nSimply  SHARE  and to be eligible  to WIN this PRIZE,  COMMENT  [What  they must comment]  to\nbe entered  to win!\nDon’t miss your chance to win BIG! 🎁\nMake  sure to check  back each day until Friday  to enter  to win that day’s  prize!\nPrizes  Include\n• [Business  Name]  — Prize  👜👑\n• [Business  Name]  — Prize\n• [Business  Name]  — Prize\n• [Business  Name]  — Prize  🦷🦷\n• [Business  Name]  — Prize  🍤🍔🥙\n• $500.00  [Name  of Practice  Gift Card]  to be used for ANY procedure!!!!\n🦷🦷🔥🔥🦷🦷🔥🔥\nGood luck! 👑\n| DR. ANIS S A HOLME  S 41\nOnce done, I post the first prize post on Facebook and Instagram using the same language. With\nInstagram, people can’t easily share the post like they can on Facebook. Thus, I modify the I nstagram\npost to remove the sharing requirement, using these as the terms to enter:\nTo be eligible  to WIN this PRIZE,  simply  COMMENT  [What  they must comment]  to\nbe entered  to win!\nBy the end of the first 19 days of my 100 day plan,  I will have built relationships  with local businesses,\nincreased  my social  media  following,  and generated  buzz and good will with potential  new patients.  My\nphone  will likely  already  be ringing  with people  wanting  to make  appointments.\nThe best part is I haven’t  spent  a penny  yet. I have leveraged  relationships  with local businesses  and\nsocial  media  engagement  to reach  potential  patients  in a positive  light,  and I have engagement  from\npeople  on my practice’s  Facebook  page that I can use with future  campaigns.\nRunning a Smile Makeover Competition\nWith my local business giveaway complete, I am now ready to run a smile makeover competition.\nInstead  of giving  away  one small  prize  each day for twelve  days,  I will give away  one life-changing  smile\ntransformation  treatment  to someone  in need.\nConducting the smile makeover competition after the local business campaign allows me to reach more\npeople for the smile makeover competition than I would have if I did it first.\nThe objective of a smile makeover competition is to generate buzz around the practice while truly\nchanging  one person’s  life with a free smile  makeover.  To do so, I simply  collect  submissions  and decide\na winner  to receive  free dental  services.\nTo enter, I will ask candidates to submit an email with their picture and story of what a free smile\nmakeover would mean to them. I select the winner and work with them directly to determine the\nlogistics  of their treatment.  I like to set up a new email  for submissions  to be sent to, so they are all in\none place. Once I have my new email address for collecting submissions and the date my promotion\nwill end (30 days after it begins), I start spreading the word. For maximum exposure for my smile\nmakeover  campaign,  I spread  the word everywhere  I can, including:\n• Announce  the contest  using  a Facebook  ad targeting  people  who have engaged  with your page\nin the  past.\n• Announce  the contest  in a Facebook  Live video.\n• Send an E-Newsletter  to patients.\n• Print a flyer to hang in my office.\n• Post follow -up posts  on my Facebook  page.\n• Conduct  follow -up ads to retargeting  audiences.\n• Reach out to the local businesses I partnered with on the gift card giveaway, and ask them to\nshare the  post.\nHere is a script I will modify and use for my smile makeover announcement:\nDo you want a FREE smile makeover? 😁😁\nEnter  to win our Smile  Makeover  Competition  for a chance  to have your smile  and dentistry\nneeds paid  for!\nTo enter our Smile Makeover Competi tion:\nSend an email  to smiles@xyz.com.\nInclude  a picture  of your smile.\nInclude  your story  and why you want  a FREE smile  makeover.\nThe winner  will be announced  [DATE].\nGood luck! 🙌\nHere is a second script:\nHey, [CITY]! 👋 Do you want to win a FREE Smile Makeover? 😁😁😁\n[PRACTICE NAME] is giving away a FREE Smile Makeover to one lucky person.

To do so, I go to Facebook’s  advertising\nplatform.\nHere are the audiences I set up:\n• People  who have engaged  with my Facebook  or Instagram  pages.\n• People  who have visited  my website.\n• Current  patients.\n• People  who have viewed  my Facebook  videos.\nDR. ANIS S A  HOLME S   | 42\n| DR. ANIS S A HOLME  S 43\n• High-income  earners.  I can create  this audience  based  on income  information  that Facebook\ncollects  as well as by targeting  people  who live on specific  streets  I know  to be in affluent  areas.\n• “Lookalike”  audiences,  which  are audiences  Facebook  auto-generates  at your request.  They\nare designed  to be full of people  who share  common  characteristics  with other  audiences  I\ncreate.  For example,  creating  a lookalike  audience  based  on my current  patients  will generate\na list of people  who share  characteristics  with my current  patients.\nEach of these  categories  of people  offers  distinct  advantages  when  posting  Facebook  or Instagram  ads.\nMany  of them  are people  who know  me already,  such as people  who have engaged  with my content  or\nwebsite.  High-income  earners  are people  who likely  value  and have an ability  to afford  quality  dental\ncare.  Lookalike  audiences  are colder  audiences  that are more  likely  to be interested  in my practice\nbecause  they share  characteristics  with patients  or people  who have engaged  with me already.\nOnce these audiences are set up in Facebook’s advertising platform, they will continue to grow. As\nmore people engage with my content, they will be added to the appropriate audience. Similarly, as\npeople visit my website, they will be added to my audience of people who visit my website.\nAfter I announce my smile giveaway, I set up these Facebook retargeting audiences.\nTraining My Team to Use the Phone to Convert Leads into Patients\nWith my Facebook and Instagram engagement rolling and my retargeting audie nces building, my\nphone  is going  to start ringing.  I need to make  sure my team  members  know  how to convert  those\nphone  calls into patients.\nTo do so, I invest  in training  my team  to ask potential  patients  powerful  questions  and then frame\nthe conversation  around  the potential  patients’  words.  For example,  if a potential  patient  calls about\nreplacing  dentures,  the typical  dental  practice  would  ask a patient  how long they have had the dentures\nand then suggest  dental  implants  as a solution.  While  that might  be where  the patient  ultimately  lands\nfrom a treatment  perspective,  it’s very cold from a conversational  perspective.\nInstead,  I would  train my team  to ask why they are interested  in replacing  their dentures.  My team\nshould  ask follow -up questions  about  how the dentures  are impacting  their life. If the potential  client\nanswers  that they are embarrassed  by having  to remove  them,  my team  member  should  invite  the\ncaller  in for a consultation  to help find a better  option  for their lifestyle.  This lets the patient  know  my\nteam  and I are focused  on helping  them,  rather  than just trying  to sell them  dental  implants.\nSimilarly,  many  times,  callers  will explain  that they want to solve a problem  with their teeth  or smile  but\nare concerned that they cannot afford it. Instead of responding with a cost, my team can instead ask\nwhether  they are ready  to move  forward  if we can help them  fit their treatment  into their budget.  This\nlets patients  know  we work hard to help patients  afford  the best care possible.\nHere are four questions my team should be prepared to ask potential patients when they call:\n• “What  is your biggest  challenge  that you are facing  with your teeth  or smile?\n• “What  do you feel would  be the biggest  benefit  if you could  get XYZ procedure  done?”\n• “Imagine  how you will look and feel when  you are smiling  with confidence  and you never  ever\nhave to worry  about   again.”\n• “If you can fit  into your budget,  are you ready  to start right away?\n| DR. ANIS S A HOLME  S 44\nIn addition  to demonstrating  empathy  for patients,  these  questions  help my team  and I pre-qualify\nleads  so we can get higher -value  patients.  For example,  if a patient  says they do not know  how the\nprocedure  will benefit  them,  they are likely  not ready  to move  forward.  If they are not ready  to start\nright away,  it’s probably  not a great  use of chair  time to invite  them  in for a consultation.  Instead,  my\nteam  can offer  to send them  information  and keep in touch  over email.\nPHASE 2: Start Running Funnels And Email Nurture Sequences\n(Days 46 - 50)\nIn Phase 1, I generated buzz, built advertising audiences, grew my reputation in my local community,\nand trained  my team  to pre-qualify  and convert  leads  into patients.  At this point,  I will likely  have begun\ngenerating  leads  and scheduling  new patients.  That’s  a natural  result  of the Phase  1 activities.\nIn Phase  2, I want to get even more  intentional  and strategic  about  using  the good will and audiences  I\nhave set up to generate  new patient  leads.  The specific  types  of patients  I target  include  dental  implant\npatient  leads,  Invisalign  patient  leads,  and patients  who are at risk of cavities  or more  advanced  tooth\ndecay.  In just five days,  I will start generating  results  from all the effort  we put in during  Phase  1.\nFor dental  implant  patients,  I would  post a Facebook  ad targeting  people  who visit my website’s  dental\nimplant page, which can be done using our website traffic retargeting audience. I would also send  out\nan email  to all patients  on our email  list. With both the ad and the email,  I would  invite  people  to take a\nquiz to learn  whether  they are a candidate  for dental  implants.\nThe following is a script I can modify and use in my email campaigns and Facebook ads:\nSubject Line: Are You a Good Candidate for Implants?\nHi, [First Name],\nThank you for your interest in dental implants!!\nA dental  implant  seems  like a good option  for you.\nLet’s talk a little  more  about  it!\nWho is a good candidate for dental implants?\nMost people with missing teeth are candidates for dental implants.\nThe most important  factor  is if you have enough  bone in your jaw to support  the implant.\nEven if the bone has deteriorated,  your oral surgeon  may still be able to perform  dental\nimplant  surgery  by using  bone grafting  to rebuild  the jaw.\nYour dentist can determine this during the planning process for the procedure. You may\nalso be asked to undergo medical tests to ensure that you don’t have a condition that\ncould interfere with your recovery.\nIf you’re  considering  a dental  implant,  you may be eligible  for a free consultation.

ANIS S A HOLME  S 45\nOur Location:\n[Address]\n[Phone  Number]\nAnd feel free to reply  to this email  with any questions  you may have.\nAll the  best,\n[Dentist/Dental Team Member Name]\nP.S. Want to check up on us? Read our amazing reviews! {LINK}\nWhen people click the link in my email or ad, it should allow them to take a simple quiz that answers\npre-qualification  questions  for dental  implant  patients.  This can be set up very simply  using  many  quiz\nsoftware  platforms.\nAs you saw in the script  above,  I also give people  an opportunity  to schedule  an appointment  right\naway.  Finally,  I also put up a frequently  asked  questions  post about  dental  implants  on my website.  By\ndoing  so, I can invite  potential  patients  to learn  more  about  whether  they are a candidate  for dental\nimplants  without  scheduling  an appointment  or taking  a quiz.  And because  I have already  set up your\nretargeting  audiences,  when  people  read the article,  they will be put in my “website  visitors”  retargeting\naudience  for future  dental  implant  ads.\nI include  an invitation  to schedule  an appointment  or take the quiz to see if they’re  a candidate  for dental\nimplants on the frequently asked questions post. Sometimes, people are unsure whether they are ready\nto take a quiz or make  an appointment  but want more  information.  After  reading  my frequently asked\nquestions  post,  some  of those  leads  will be ready  to take the quiz or make  an appointment,  but they\nmight  not go back to the email  or ad where  I invited  them  to take a quiz or appointment.  So, I give them\na prominent  call to action  to take the quiz or make  an appointment  right in the frequently  asked\nquestions  post.\nI do the same for Invisalign and cavity risk: send an email and post a Facebook ad inviting people to\ndetermine whether they are a good candidate for Invisalign or cavity risk assessment, give them an\nopportunity to schedul e an appointment, and post an article of frequently asked questions on my\nwebsite so visitors will be added to retargeting audiences on Facebook.\nIn just five days,  I will start to get patients  taking  quizzes,  scheduling  appointments,  and being  added\nto retargeting  audiences.\nPHASE 3: Building Buzz And Nurturing Leads (Days 51 – 80)\nDuring phase three, I will focus on nurturing relationships with leads and continue to target potential\npatients for high -value services. To nurture relationships, I will run a 30 -Day Floss Challenge and run\nvideo ads of patient testimonials.\nThe purpose  of the Floss Challenge  is to inspire  patients  and social  media  followers  to take a 30-Day\nFloss Challenge  as well as to continue  the process  of building  warm  audiences.  To encourage  people  to\nenter,  I would  offer  weekly  prizes,  such as Starbucks  gift cards,  movie  theater  gift cards,  free electric\ntoothbrushes,  gift cards  to my own practice,  Amazon  gift cards,  Apple  watches,  or tickets  to a local\namusement  park.\n| DR. ANIS S A HOLME  S 46\nI don’t have to tell you about the importance of flossing. You know the stats. Studies find patients are\nmore likely  to floss if there’s  an incentive.  And no, unfortunately,  most people  don’t  find good oral health\nto be much  of an incentive.  So, this campaign  is designed  to promote  good oral hygiene  habits  while  offering\na fun incentive,  and when  people  start focusing  on flossing,  they will have their oral health  top of mind.  This\nallows  me to get people  to schedule  appointments  without  asking  them  to. It will happen  naturally.\nTo enter, I have participants sign the Floss Pledge and take a photo of themselves holding their signed\npledge. Here are two options for pledge graphics you can use.\nPledge  Graphic  Option  1\nPledge  Graphic  Option  2\nTo keep the momentum  going,  I have participants  upload  pictures  throughout  each week  of them  and\ntheir families  flossing.  I choose  a photo  entry  at random  at the end of each week  for weekly  prizes.\n| DR. ANIS S A HOLME  S 47\nCandidates  who submit  a picture  each week  will be entered  for the grand  prize.  As with the other\nchallenges  and giveaways,  I spread  the word in as many  ways as I can, including:\n• Announcing  the contest  on Facebook,\n• Sending  an E-Newsletter  to patients,  and\n• Having  a flyer printed  for my front office.\nWhile my 30 -Day Floss Challenge is running, I also start running video ads of patient testimonials. To\nget patient  testimonials,  I ask every  patient,  “How  was your experience  today?”  When  they say “great,”\nI say, “awesome! Would you be willing to share you r experience through a quick video? It just might\nchange someone’s  life.”\n(If you’re  not comfortable  asking  every  patient  for a video  testimonial,  start by asking  your most loyal\nand outgoing  ones first.)\nOnce  I collect  a few testimonials,  I post those  videos  as ads for my practice.  Video  testimonials  are\npowerful,  even more  powerful  than online  reviews  because  potential  patients  can feel and see the\nenthusiasm  with which  my patients  express  their excitement  for my practice.\nFinally,  I also run video  ads for high-value  services  I want to offer.  For example,  I could  record  a video  of\nthree  ways to replace  missing  teeth.  In the video,  I explain  the three  options  and invite  people  to take\nthe quiz I set up to see if they’re  a candidate  for dental  implants,  schedule  an appointment,  or read my\narticle  answering  frequently  asked  questions.\nPHASE 4: Driving Traffic And Converting Leads Into Patients\n(Days 81 –100)\nWhen  I follow  the first three  phases,  I will likely  be generating  patient  leads  on a regular  basis.  I may\nhave already  generated  more  than 100 patients.  When  I help practices  walk through  these  phases,  we\nsee tremendous  growth,  not only in patient  growth  but also in profitability  and practice  culture.\nNo matter  what  my results  are to date,  however,  during  Phase  4, I get even more  focused  on driving  the\nright traffic  to my dental  marketing  funnels  and converting  the leads  those  funnels  generate  into new\npatients.\nFor a refresher, here is just some of what I accomplished during the first 80 days:\n• Built relationships  with local businesses,\n• Organized multiple giveaways to build relationships with social followers and community\nmembers,\n• Conducted  a smile  makeover  promotion  to help transform  the life of someone  in need,\n• Set up Facebook  retargeting  audiences  to get better  results  for my dental  marketing  campaigns\nat lower  costs,\n• Trained  my team  members  on how to convert  leads  into patients,\n• Run campaigns for dental implants, Invisalign, and cavity risk, or whatever other high -value\nprocedures  I decided  to grow,  and more!\n| DR. ANIS S A HOLME  S 48\nIn Phase  4, I focus  on running  additional  traffic  to my campaigns.  I can do this by running  additional\ncampaigns,  such as clothing  drives  around  the holiday  seasons,  or by placing  additional  ads specific  to\nthe campaigns  I have already  put in place  - or both!\nFor example,  if I want  to run a clothing  campaign  around  Christmas,  I could  modify  and use the following\ntext for Facebook  ads or email  marketing  efforts:\nHey, [INSERT CITY, if using a  Facebook ad] or [First Name, if on email]! 👋\nNeed to make room for all your new clothes from Christmas?\nWe’re hosting a clothing drive with [DONATION RECIPIENT COMPANY]. 👕👖👗\nAs a thank  you, all participants  will be entered  for a chance  to win 🎉 $250 worth  of\nFREE Dental Care!  🎉\nTo participate  and be entered  to win, simply  bring  your clothes  to [PRACTICE  NAME]  at\n[ADDRESS]  before  [DATE].  😁\nAfter you experience success following this simple program, please tell me about it so I\ncan celebrate with you!\nI keep my traffic running to my quizzes and FAQ articles with prominent invitations for people to\nschedule appointments throughout these final 20 days.\nI also celebrate  as my phone  keeps  ringing  with new patients  coming  in for cavity  risk assessments,\ndental implants,  Invisalign,  or whatever  other  procedures  I decide  to promote!\nConclusion\nIf you follow  these  four phases  consistently  over 100 days,  you will likely  have grown  your social  media\npresence significantly while generating more patient leads than you imagined possible in such a short\nperiod of  time.\nThis is the exact  four-phase  process  I would  follow  if I needed  to generate  patients  fast, and it’s the\nexact  four-phase  proven  process  we have used to help dental  practices  around  the world  do the same.\nBest of luck with your funnel!\n| BR ICK & MOR TAR FU N N E L  S 49\nDr. Chad  Woolner\nCEO of Align Integrated  Medical\nDr. Chad Woolner  is the go-to guy for creating  online\nChiropractic  marketing  funnels  that effectively  attract\n& convert  high quality  new patients.

CHAD  W O O L N E R  50\n100 New Chiropractic  Patients  In 100 Days\nHoly Cow!  I was so honored  when  Russell  invited  me to participate  in such a cool project  like this. It\nhas been amazing  to see just what  has transpired  with ClickFunnels  since  the good ol’ beta testing\ndays.  You see, I was one of the first 20 people  to ever use ClickFunnels  in “the real world”.  I saw it from\nits original  inception  to the full-blown  movement  it’s become  today.  I have seen first hand just how\npowerful  ClickFunnels  is for us brick  and mortar  business  owners.  I feel like sometimes  we get lost in\nthe shuffle  with all the glitz and glamour  of all the online  business  world.  I’m biased,  I know,  but I believe\nthat us brick  and mortar  business  owners  are the coolest  business  owners  out there!  (No offense  to\nthe online  guys and gals; I have an online  business,  too.)\nMy story is unfortunately all too common for many brick and mortar business owners, especially\nprofessional,  service -based  businesses  like chiropractors,  dentists,  lawyers,  etc. We didn’t  go to school\nfor business. We went to school to become professionals, and yet, for many of us, we unknowingly\nentered  the world  of entrepreneurship.  Some  (few)  are able to figure  things  out. Most however,  struggle.\nI was one of the ones in that latter  group.  I struggled  for years  in the practice.  I knew  Russell  way back\nwhen I was just getting started in the practice. He got a front row seat, so to speak, of all the various\nthings  I tried (mud  I threw  experimentally  against  the wall to see what stuck).  Most of which  were,  let’s\nsay, less than effective.  He was there  for the entire  ride and saw the struggle.  When  and where  he could,\nhe’d offer encouragement and advice, but at the end of the day, it was my business and therefore my\nresponsibility  to make  things  happen.  I hired  (and fired)  multiple  consulting  groups.  You name  it, I tried\nit. For nearly  5 years,  I was barely  scraping  by. I know  firsthand  the pain of trying  to bring  your vision  to\nlife only to seem  to fail every  step of the way. I know  it might  sound  perhaps  a bit cliche,  but I was literally\non the verge  of throwing  in the towel  altogether.  My wife and I were very seriously  contemplating  selling\nmy chiropractic  practice,  hoping  we could  at least pay off the debts  I had incurred  and break -even and\nthen move  to another  state to try something  new.\nIt was right around  this time that I was about  to abandon  my dream  of a successful  chiropractic  practice\nthat Russell suggested I try using this new software he had developed called, ClickFunnels. I started\nplaying  around  with it, and it got my mental  wheels  turning.  I came  up with an idea of how I could  use\nit to put a new spin on a relatively old -school marketing strategy known as a “lunch and learn”. I put\ntogether  my first funnel  and the rest, as they say, is history.  The end….\n…C’mon  now! You don’t  think  I’d leave  you hanging  did you? Nope.  I wanted  to properly  set the stage\nfor you if for no other  reason  than to show  you that what  I am about  to share  with you is born out of\nreal life experience.  I’ve been in the trenches  from the beginning.  I’ve got all the battle  scars  to prove  it,\nso what  I will share  with you from here on out is 0% fluff and theory  and 100% total tactical  MEAT.  You\ncan have complete  confidence  in what  I am going  to teach  you here because  it has not only worked  for\nme in my practice  but literally  hundreds  of other  chiropractors  (and other  healthcare  professionals)  all\nover the world!  The path that I’m going  to show  you is dead-simple,  but it requires  some  hard work.  For\nme, anything  that fits this criteria  is music  to my ears because  I know  that although  I may not be the\nsmartest,  most talented  guy in the world,  I know  I can work hard.\nI’m going  to break  my plan down  into weekly  increments.  If I take 100 days and divide  that by 7 days per\nweek,  that roughly  works  out to be just over 14 weeks.  So, I’ve got 14 weeks  to get 100 new patients,  or\nan average  of 7 new patients  per week.  No problem!  Let’s go!\n| DR. CHAD  W O O L N E R  51\nThe Three Primary Phases\nI’m going to divide my overall strategy into 3 primary phases:\nPhase #1: The Sprint Phase,\nPhase #2: The Surge Phase, and\nPhase #3:  The Marathon Phase.\nI’m going to do this intentionally because this helps me avoid what I call “The New Patient  Roller\nCoaster”.  This sucks.  I need to create  a series  of funnels  that work together  to help provide  greater\nconsistency  and stability  for generating  new patients.\nYou see, if all I did was treat funnels  like some  new gimmick  or quick -fix band-aid to simply  get a “bunch\nof new patients”, then I’d seriously be underutilizing a powerful tool for helping me grow and scale my\npractice.  I don’t  simply  want to get a bunch  of new patients  really  quickly  only to see things  fizzle and\nfade.  So rather  than that, I’m going  to set up a funnel  growth  strategy  to help myself  capitalize  on\nmomentum  so I can leverage  my results  to help fuel business  growth.\nPHASE #1: THE SPRINT PHASE\nThe objective  of The Sprint  Phase  is simple:  get as many  high quality,  paying,  new patients  to my practice\nas quickly as  possible.\n| DR. CHAD  W O O L N E R  52\nWeeks 1 and 2: Begin The Reboot Workshop Funnel\nThe Reboot  Funnel  is an entirely  new approach  on a familiar  strategy  that most docs refer to as “lunch\nand learns”  or “lunch  workshops.”  I call it the Reboot  Funnel  because  it’s based  on a workshop  I do in\nmy community  known  as “The 30-Minute  Reboot.”  I also call it the Reboot  Funnel  because  it’s literally\nthe funnel  I used to “reboot”  my practice  so to speak.  When  I first began  developing  this funnel,  I\nthought  back to some  of the more  effective  strategies  for acquiring  new patients  up until that point.\nI knew  that doing  lunch  workshops  was by far one of the more  effective  strategies  that I had used.  I\nhad a consulting  group  that told me to start doing  them.  I did, and they produced  some  pretty  good\nresults.  There  were just two big problems  with the typical  approach  that most chiropractors  are taught\nregarding lunch  workshops:\nProblem #1: The “Thinly Veiled Sales Pitch”\nThe way I had been taught by most of the various consulting groups, coaches and “gurus” out there\nwas to do a passionate speech about the wonders and benefits of chiropractic care and why everyone\nshould go see a  chiropractor. I thought It made sense at the time. But looking back, I realized that I\nwasn’t  providing  any real, substantive  value  for my audiences  besides  a free lunch.  It was nothing  more\nthan a cheap excuse to jump in front of group and capture their attention just long enough to make a\nquick  sales pitch,  which  inevitably  lead me to problem  #2.\nProblem #2: The “One Shot Is All You Got” Approach\nThere  I would  be, making  the transition  from the “valuable”  presentation  portion  of the lunch  workshop\nto the “pitch”  portion  of the workshop.  I could  always  sense  when  the pitch  was approaching.  I could  feel\nit, and I am sure my audience  could  too. I felt a tremendous  amount  of pressure  to make  sure I “nailed”\nthe pitch  just right because  I only had one shot to get it right.  I had lucked  out on getting  their attention\nfor just long enough,  so I now had to strike  then and there  while  I still had their attention  so I could  get the\nhighest  percentage  of sign-ups possible.  Sometimes  we’d get people  to sign up, but often  we wouldn’t.\nIt created  quite  a bit of pressure  to perform.  As a result  of this pressure,  I often  found  myself  clumsy  and\nawkward  and usually  frustrated  with the inconsistency  of the results.  It was awful,  and I hated  it.\n| DR. CHAD  W O O L N E R  53\nThe Reboot  Funnel  helped  to eliminate  both of these  common  problems  by first creating  immense,\nreal value  for my audience  besides  just a free lunch  as a cheap  excuse  to pitch  the group.  Second,\nit provided  a more  consistent  framework  to follow  that allowed  me to create  an authentic  ongoing\nconversation  with my audience.  We made  the shift from the “One  shot is all you got” approach  to now\nproviding ongoing value -based communication with the group through our “Re -Invite Sequence”,\nshown  on the Funnel  Map diagram.\nYou’re  probably  saying  “Okay,  that sounds  all good and fine in theory,  but how does this look in reality?”\nPretty simple  actually.\nFirst, I create a value -based workshop. When I say value -based, I don’t mean a boring “techno -jargon\nbased”  presentation  that tries to cram a decade  of education  down  their throats  in one sitting.  I’m not\ntalking  about  a thinly -veiled  sales pitch  either.  No! I have to start with one simple  question:  “What’s  a\nbig (and common) problem that I can teach people to solve through my workshop?” From there I can\nuse this as a springboard for creating new, exciting, engaging worksh ops that will provide value for my\ncommunity independent of myself, my clinic and the free lunch. What might be some examples of\nvalue -based  workshops?  Here are some  ideas  off the top of my head:\n1. The “10 Minute Headache Solution” Workshop: Teach a simple, natural routine or solution\nthat will help them  both prevent  and eliminate  headaches\n2. The “Back Hacks” Workshop: Show the best “hacks” for preventing back injuries in the\nworkplace  and getting  relief  from work related  back problems.\n3. The “Energizer ” Workshop: Give 3 incredible tips for quickly boosting energy and enhancing\nproductivity in the  workplace.\n4. The “Tension  Reset”  Workshop:  Provide  some  simple,  quick  and easy to implement  strategies\nto reduce  muscle  tension  and stress.\n5. The “Brain  Boost”  Workshop:  Share  some  of the best food,  supplements  and tools attendees\ncan use to boost  their mood  and overall  brain  function.\nNotice how these workshops were not intended to be general, catch -all “Improve Your Health” type\npresentations. Nope. They were  designed to solve specific but common problems. By approaching    it\nthis way, I’m narrowing my messaging to help provide a much higher level of perceived value. At the\nsame time, I’m keeping my topic broad enou gh to apply to the vast majority of my audience. My\nworkshop isn’t going to simply be some “rah-rah”, “fluff” presentation. It will give real value upfront\nfirst. I am going to employ the classic strategy that Robert Cialdini refers to in his book, Influence , as\n“The Law of Reciprocity.”  It simply  states  that if we give value  first, we will receive  value  in return.  No\nwhere  have I found  this to be more  true than with my funnels,  and especially  the Reboot  Funnel.  What\nhappened  when  I made  the transition  from the old-school  “thinly -veiled  sales pitch,  one shot is all you\ngot” approach to a value -based approach? It led to far more consistent predictable results. Once I\nfinish  the “delivery”  portion  of the workshop,  I then transition  to the “invit e” portion.  Simply  put, at the\nend of every workshop, I extend what I refer to as a “special invitation” to everyone in attendance.  To\navoid  making  it feel the least bit salesy  (like a time-share  pitch),  I always  use total transparency  right\nup front by saying  something  like this:\nHello  and thank  you so much  for allowing  us this opportunity  to present  to you the\nworkshop.  We’re  really  excited  to be able to share  this information  with you because  we\nknow  that this can change  people’s  lives.  You might  be wondering  why we’re  here,  so let\n| DR. CHAD  W O O L N E R  54\nus just share  with you right up front  what our goal is for today.  Anytime  we go out and do\nthese workshops, our primary goal is to provide as much value as possible. Let me get\nmore  specific  with you. What  we’re  going  to be sharing  today  are some  strategies  that you\ncan use, independent  of us, that will have an immediate  impact  for good on your health  as\nwell as your productivity  at work.  At the end of every  workshop  that we do, we want to be\ntotally  transparent  and let you know  that we always  extend  a special  invitation  to anybody\nwho would  like to come  in and see us at our clinic.  But understand  first and foremost  that\nour primary goal today is to provide you with as much value as possible. You should be\nseeing  a signup  sheet  going  around  right now. If you’ll  put down  your name  and your email,\nwe’re  going  to provide  you with all of the notes  from today’s  workshop.  That way you can\njust enjoy your lunch and not have to worry about taking notes. And then in addition  to\nthat,  we’re  also going  to be sharing  with you a lot of resources  that we covered  today,  and\nwe’ll  be sending  those  to you absolutely  free. Cool?  Alright!  So, let’s get started.\nWhen the introduction is done correctly, it takes so much pressure off of the new patient acquisition\noffer! When they accept the invitation, they become new patients (NPA on the Funnel M ap above\nstands for “New Patient Acquisition”).\nBeyond  the actual  workshop  delivery  itself,  I will also now continue  with an ongoing,  value -based  follow\nup (shown  on the Funnel  Map as “Re-Invite  #1-Re-Invite  #3”).  The way I do this is quite  easy.  Once  the\nworkshop  is done,  I then provide  an automated  series  of emails  that take them  to additional  pages\nwe’ve  created  in ClickFunnels  that will deliver  the notes  and free resources  that I promised  I’d send\nthem.  With each of these  communications  I yet again  provide  real value  as well as another  opportunity\nto “re-invite”  them  into my clinic.\nNow that I have my workshop created, it’s time to get in front of a group and present it. Some of you\nmight be thinking “Okay, so how do we do that?!” Good question. I realized that if the key to more\nhigh quality new patients was in doing more consistent workshops, then the key to more consistent\nworkshops  was a predictable  system  for setting  them  up. I developed  both online  and offline  strategies\nfor setting up the workshops themselves. Specifically, I have 3 different approaches or offers, both\nonline  and offline,  as seen on the Reboot  Funnel  Workshop  Map where  it says “Offer  x 3”.\nMy next step once I’ve created  my workshop  is to then build  a simple  landing  page in Clickfunnels  for\nmy workshop  like the one shown  below.\n| DR. CHAD  W O O L N E R  55\nOnce  my page has been created,  I’m going  to need to drive  traffic  to it to begin  setting  up workshops.\nNow,  I’m going  to assume  here that,  in this scenario,  I don’t  have any extra  money  at the moment  to\nspend  on ads to drive  traffic  to this funnel  yet, so I’ll start with some  quick  wins first.\nYou might  be saying“Okay,  but what  do I do when  people  sign up for a workshop?”  Don’t  overcomplicate\nit. Stay organized.  Follow  up. Get through  to the proper  decision  maker.  Sell the value  of the workshop,\nand get it scheduled.  It’s that simple.\nLow-Hanging Fruit\nFirst,  I will begin  driving  traffic  to this page by leveraging  my existing  relationships.  I will use social  media\n(not paid traffic,  organic  first),  email,  postcards  and flyers  in my office  and face-to-face communication\nto begin setting up my first series of workshops. I should be able to easily setup at least 3 within the\nfirst 2  weeks.\nIf I average 2 new patients per workshop that I do, I now have 6 new patients! Not bad, only 94 to go!\nWeeks 3 and 4: Driving More Traffic To My Workshop Funnel\nNow that I have a couple  workshops  under  my belt, it’s time to see if I can build  some  momentum  by\nscheduling  even more  workshops.  If I’m really  looking  to “sprint”  and get as many  new patients  as\npossible,  as quickly  as possible,  then I think  it’s a good goal,  and very realistic,  to set up an average  of\n3 workshops  per week.  This means  that if I’m sticking  with the low average  of only 2 new patients  per\nworkshop,  that I’m now going  to start averaging  6 new patients  per week  from this funnel  alone.  That\nmeans  that,  assuming  this funnel  only produced  6 new patients  per week,  then I’d have around  84 new\npatients  by the end of 14 weeks!  Again,  not bad at all, especially  considering  that this is all coming  from\njust one funnel.  I guess  that old saying  “You’re  just one funnel  away”  is true after  all. But, the good news\nis that I’m just getting  started!\nNow I’m going  to add in both the “Lead  Box Method”  and the “Welcome  Guest  Approach”  to set up\nsome  more  workshops.  These  two are the logical  next steps  as they are again  very low to no cost.  First,\nThe Lead Box Method:\nThe Lead Box Method\nI will purchase a couple lead boxes and start talking to local restaurants. Usually I try and start with\nlocally -owned, popular lunch destinations. The approach to the restaurant is really simple. If they’ll\nallow me to put up a lead box offering a chance for people to “Win a FREE Lunch” for  them and their\nco-workers  or employees  from the restaurant,  then I’ll pay for the catered  free lunch.  This is a true win/\nwin. They get more catering, and I get more lunch workshops! BOOM! I’m shooting for around 2 to 3\nlead boxes  at first. This should  easily  result  in at least 10 quality  workshop  leads  per week  per location,\nultimately  giving  me greater  odds of averagin g at least 3 workshops  per week.\nThe Welcome Guest Approach\nWhat’s  the difference  between  an “Annoying  Pest”  and a “Welcome  Guest”?  At this point,  the answer\nshould  be dead obvious:  VALUE!  This is a super -simple,  bootstrap  approach  to getting  more  workshops\n| DR. CHAD  W O O L N E R  56\nsetup.  I’ll simply  set a goal of weekly  business  contacts  each week.  I like to wire this at a 90% failure\nrate. Not only is this more  than realistic,  but it allows  me to reverse  engineer  the math  for success.  I\ntry to treat  each individual  traffic  source  for the lunch  workshop  funnel  as though  it’s the only one I\nam relying  on. If I approach  it this way, I know  I’m virtually  guaranteed  to hit the goals  I am setting.\nSo assuming a 90% failure rate, if I am wanting to average 3 workshops per week, then how many\ncontacts  do I need to make  each week?  I need 30. If I can average  30 community/business  contacts\nper week,  then I know  I can safely  assume  I’ll wind up with at least 3 lunch  workshops  (again,  assuming\nthis is the ONLY  traffic  source  I am using).  If I need to hit 30 contacts  per week,  then I only need to\nmake  6 contacts  per day if I am making  contacts  5 days per week!  EASY!\nWeeks 5 and 6: Driving Paid Traffic To My Workshop Funnel And Growing My Audience\nAt this point, the math and the process might seem a bit overly simplistic, and I’ll be the first to say\nthat that’s  true. I do this not because  it’s not realistic,  but because  it’s honestly  the easiest  way to help\nyou get a clear picture of how this all works. If you knew me, I always try to wire things as absolutely\nrealistically  as possible  and try to factor  in real-life (the worst  case scenario).\nNow it’s time to begin  looking  into paid traffic  sources  for my funnel.  You may be wondering  why it is\nnecessary  to add in paid traffic  on top of all these  other  traffic  strategies,  especially  if the others  are\nfree. The answer  is simple.  First,  diversity  of traffic  creates  stability.  If we have a variety  of workshop\nsetup  systems  in place,  we aren’t  nearly  as negatively  impacted  if one traffic  source  begins  to be less\neffective  or stops  working  all together.  Adding  paid traffic  into the mix is a good way to create  more\nstability.  Second,  paid traffic  is an effective  way to scale  faster.  Paid traffic  may include  Facebook  ads\nand/or other social media ads. It might include Google Pay-Per-Click or other various online paid\nplatforms.  But before  we even get into that,  we need to understand  something  fundamental  to paid\ntraffic.  One of the most common  questions  that chiropractors  will ask me when  they first consider  paid\ntraffic  is “How  much  should  I spend  on ads?”  We can’t  even begin  to arrive  at an accurate  answer  to\nthis question  without  first understanding  what  a new patient  is worth.\nPaid Traffic Cost Estimating 101\nKnowing  how much  a patient  is worth  to you is the key to understanding  how much  you can spend  on\npaid traffic.  We can arrive  at your case value  (how  much  each new patient  is worth)  by simply  dividing\nyour monthly  (or better  yet, yearly)  collections  by your total number  of new patients.  For instance,  if\nyou collected  $20,000  for the month  and you saw 20 new patients  that month,  then your average  case\nvalue  would  be $1,000.  Or we’ll  say divide  $240,000  in annual  collections  by 240 annual  new patients\nfor a case value  of $1,000.  Ideally  the more  time you can look at the more  accurate  your average  will\nbe. Make  sense?  So now that you know  that your average  case value  is $1,000  you can now begin  to\nmake  smarter,  calculated  decisions  on how much  you can and should  spend  to acquire  a new patient.\nNow,  that being  said, I would  make  sure to start small  and not simply  throw  a bunch  of money  into paid\ntraffic  sources  right out the gate just because  you know  what  a new patient  is worth  to you. You want to\nstart small,  and scale  from there.\nI would begin with a safe bet of around $500 or so on Facebook, Instagram or LinkedIn ads to drive\ntraffic to my lunch workshop funnel. The interesting thing, though, is that I can start asking an even\ndeeper  question  later down  the road:  “what’s  a lunch  workshop  worth  to me?”  In reality  I’m not actually\ndriving  patients  to a “new  patient”  funnel  just yet. I’m driving  traffic  to a lunch  workshop  funnel.  So, to\ncalculate what a lunch workshop is worth,  I multiply my average new patient value by the number of\n| DR. CHAD  W O O L N E R  57\nnew patients  I average  per workshop.  If I average  2 new patients  per workshop,  then a workshop  is in\ntheory  worth  at least $2,000.\nGrowing My Audience\nMeanwhile,  now that I am at around  weeks  5 and 6 of this process,  something  else has been occurring\nsomewhat  behind  the scenes  that is pretty  exciting.  Whether  I realize  it or not, I’ve been growing  an\naudience!  At each workshop  that I do, I’m collecting  emails  which  will then be put into a funnel  follow -\nup email  sequence.  Beyond  that,  what  else? This is where  they get put into some  type of an “Ongoing\nCommunication  System”  (see The Reboot  Funnel  MAP where  it says “OCS”).  The OCS is simply  a way\nto continue  an authentic,  value -based  conversation  with my audience.  I could  use a “Soap  Opera”\nsequence like Russell teaches in his book DotComSecrets , or I could model some of the “Seinfeld\nemails”  in that same  book.  Ultimately,  I want to treat  my audience  like they’re,  well….people!  One of\nthe most natural  byproducts  of establishing  an OCS is that I will see over time an increase  in passive\nnew patients coming to my clinic from prior workshops (see the Reboot Funnel Map where it says\n“Increased  % of passive  NPs”).  Imagine  for a minute  that average  group  I’m providing  my workshop\nfor is an audience  of 10. I can safely  assume  around  30 new contacts  put into my OCS per week.  That\nmeans  at this point  I already  have an audience  of 180 people!  If I can continue  a sincere,  authentic\nconversation  with my audience,  I’ll have much  greater  success  with any and all future  funnels  I create.\nTrust me, there  are plenty  more  funnels  to create  and use!\nPHASE #2: THE SURGE PHASE\nThe objective  of The Surge  Phase  is to dramatically  boost  my growth  by capitalizing  on my new greatest\nasset: My  Audience!\nWeeks 7 through 12: Continue Running My Workshop Funnel And\nAdding In “The Epic Event Funnel ”\nOkay,  so this is where  things  start to get really  fun! At this point,  assuming  a bare minimum  of a $1,000\ncase average, and an average of 6 new patients per week, that should mean that I’m somewhere in the\nballpark of $48,000 gross  collections so far (6 patients per week x 8 weeks = $48,000). Now,         I\nunderstand that if I’m billing insurance and having to collect on the money that not all of that will\nactually  be in your bank,  but for our purposes  here,  I’m just going  to keep it simple,  cool?\nI should now have the ability to invest some money into what I refer to as “An Epic Event”. The secret\nto an epic event  is getting  a large enough  group  of people  to the event  to make  it, well, epic! It makes\nno sense investing any money into advertising your event, renting a venue for your event, and all the\nother  stuff that goes into it without  getting  a ton of people  there.  That would  be a huge waste.  I typically\nspend around $2,000 -$3,000 on an Epic Event. That might seem like a lot of money, but I average\naround  20-30 new patients  per event!  Tell me, would  you spend  $2,000 -$3,000  to make  $20,000 -\n$30,000? I’m basically going to show you a way to 10x your investment, fair enough?\nNow,  I DO NOT want  to simply  throw  an event  together  last minute.  Don’t  make  the mistake  of rushing\nan event. I always recommend that you give it at least 6 to 8 weeks, whi ch is perfect timing  here\nbecause  that puts me right near week  14 (the 100 day mark).  What  greater  way to celebrate  the “100\nnew patients  in 100 days”  goal by having  a totally  EPIC Event?\n| DR. CHAD  W O O L N E R  58\nWhat’s  funny  about  this funnel  is that Russell  was there  at my very first Epic Event.  My team  and I held\nit at a movie  theater.  We provided  a free showing  of one of the newer  Star Wars movies  to our patients\nand friends in the community (our audience), and we PACKED the theater. I think even Russell was\nblown away by it all. He was especially excited when he saw a flood of people lining up to sign up to\nbecome  new patients  at the end of the movie.  At the end of it all he came  up to me and asked,  “How’d\nyou do that man?” That was one of the coolest moments of my entire practice journey. I got to show\nhim the process  we created,  or the funnel,  that had just generated  24 new patients!\nHere’s the layout of the landing page we used to market our Epic Event to patients and friends in the\ncommunity.  Watch  Star Wars in the movie  theater  for FREE?  Talk about  an irresistible  offer!  No wonder\nwe were able to pack the movie  theater.\nHere is the breakdown of the Epic Event funnel, or the Epic Event funnel Map:\n| DR. CHAD  W O O L N E R  59\nAt the top, it starts with a series of invites (Invites #1 -Invite #3).  This should seem pretty straight\nforward.  I’m going  to send out email  invitations  to my new audience.  The emails  will take them  to the\n“Event  Announcement  page”  where  they’ll  RSVP for the event  by clicking  on the button  and filling  out\na simple  form (name,  email,  phone  number,  how many  guests?).\nFrom there,  most might  think  that we simply  wait for them  to now show  up to the movie,  right?  WRONG!\nNo way. That is a recipe  for not getting  half as many  RSVPs  and even worse,  a ton of no-shows!\nIn order to explain the purpose behind the Intensification Sequence emails (I.S. #1-I.S. #3), we first\nneed to understand  something  really  basic.  What  is your greatest  competition  in business?  It’s not who\n(or what)  you may think.  It’s not the other  chirop ractor  down  the road.  It’s not the medical  doctor.  It’s\nnot even the drug companies! Your greatest competition is all of the various things competing for your\naudience’s  time,  attention  and energy.  Think  about  that for a minute!  Which  is easier,  for them  to show\nup to an event, or to stay home and watch TV? Even more common is the fact that you’re competing\nwith family schedules that consist of soccer practices, ballet recitals, church activities, dentist\nappointments, etc. The point is that you have to get your event from the mental space and place of\n“maybe  we’ll go to that”  to “we’ve  got to get to that event!”  The only way that that will ever happen,  is if\nyou actively compete for their time, attention and energy AND give them multiple compelling  reasons\nto show  up.\nSo how do I do that? Enter the Intensification Sequence Emails. These are designed to help create a\ngreater sense of urgency and excitement leading up to the event. I’ll slightly reveal or elude to some\nsurprises  that will happen  at the event.  I’ll provide  little incentives  for the first 20 or 50 people  to show\nup. Simple things like that are designed to create a far greater level of interest and engagement with\nthe event.  Does it work?  The pictures  below  are from a few of our Epic Events.  They don’t  really  do them\njustice, but it’s powerful proof that it works. We average around 200 -500 people  showing up to our\nevents!  Can you imagine  an audience  of 200-500 people  at one of your events?\n| DR. CHAD  W O O L N E R  60\nNow that I have attendees  at my event,  what do I do? How does getting  hundreds  of people  to show up\ntranslate  into new patients  in my practice?  Again,  it doesn’t  have to be complicated.  In fact, it’s quite\nsimple.  I use a process  I refer to as G & O, or “Glue  & Offer”.  This means  I want to “glue”  butts  in seats\nor at least give myself  a sufficient  window  of time to capture  the attention  of the entire  audience  long\nenough to extend a limited -time new patient offer to them. What I’ve found works best and provides\neven more value for them is to hold a raffle drawing at the end of the event. You don’t have to spend\nthousands  on raffle prizes.  In fact I get much,  if not most,  of the cost of our raffle  subsidized  by donations\nfrom other local business owners, or what is referred to in the online world as “JV partners” or “Joint\nVenture  Partners”.  During  the raffle,  I will explain  the new patient  offer,  and I’ll let them  know  that this\nspecial  offer is good for that day only, creating  yet again  more  urgency  and scarcity  to get them  to take\naction  right then and there.  If I am averaging  around  20-30 new patients  per event  that I do, I will sign\nup 20 new patients even on the low side (remember NPA on the funnel map stands for “New Patient\nAcquisition”).  I will hit my goal of 100 new patients  in 100 days!\nRemember,  I am already  averaging  6 new patients  per week  from the Workshop  Funnel  (2 new patients\nper workshop  x 3 workshops  per week  = 6 new patients  per week).  That put us at a total of 84 new\npatients.  84 + 20 = 104! Actually,  I beat it!\nAgain,  the funnel  doesn’t  simply  end there.  There’s  always  a large  group  of people  who weren’t  able to\nmake  it that I should  extend  my offer  to. This is why I add in the “Offer  Extension  Sequence”  (O.E.  #1-\nO.E. #3). This is a simple  series  of emails  that show  some  of the fun highlights  of the event  and provide\na recap  both for those  who attended  and those  who didn’t.  It provides  an authentic  way to extend  out\nthe offer  a bit longer  to those  who were unable  to attend  or were unable  to take advantage  of the offer\nat the event  for whatever  reason.  This simple  step ensures  that we are maximizing  our results  from this\nfunnel.\nPHASE #3: THE MARATHON PHASE\nThe objective  of The Marathon  Phase  is to begin  the shift away from simply  “getting  lots of new patients\nright now”  to creating  greater  stability  through  establishing  superior  positioning  in my community  for\nmy areas of  expertise.\nWeeks 7 through 14: Building My “Portfolio of Proof ”\n“Woah there, Chad! Wait a second. Didn’t we already cover weeks 7 -12?”\nYes, but we need to back up just a second  and cover  some  other  really  important  stuff that needs  to\ntake place  during  this time as well.  There’s  a little overlap  here.  Jump  in a time machine  with me really\nquickly,  and let’s go back to week  7, okay?\nIf you’ve followed Russell for any period of time, one thing you should have seen that he did very\nsoon after  ClickFunnels  launched  is that he immediately  began  gathering  and creating  compelling,\npowerful  success  stories  or “case  studies”.  Remember  his story  about  Drew  Canole  with Organify  or\nGarrett  White  with the Warrior  movement?  Who can forget  the energetic,  always  happy  Liz Benny  with\nher social  media  company  and her trademarked  “KAPOW!”  that she’s  so well known  for? What  are\nall of these?  Social  proof.  Again,  taking  a lesson  out of the book Influence  by Robert  Cialdini,  social\nproof  is one of the very most effective  forms  of influence  we can ever use. The problem  is that most\nchiropractors  use it totally  ineffectively,  or worse  yet, ignore  it entirely.  But not you. You’re  going  to\ncapitalize  on the power  of social  proof  right out of the gate.  This is exactly  what  I began  doing  once I\n| DR. CHAD  W O O L N E R  61\nshifted from “survival mode” to “thrive mode”.\nWhat  I’m going  to do starting  week  7 and onward  is capture  (on video)  at least 1 compelling  success\nstory  from the patients  I’ve been able to help so far. It shouldn’t  be too difficult  to find a good case\nstudy  out of an approximate  42 new patients.\nNow before  we get into the logistics  of this, I feel it’s worth  showing  the marketing  psychology  of why\nutilizing  social  proof  as the means  to boost  your positioning  is such a powerful  tool.\nIf you can achieve  superior  positioning  in your community  (i.e. become  known  as the go-to chiropractor\nfor  , this could be anything, sports chiropractic, pediatrics, nutrition, functional medicine,\nregenerative medicine, etc.), everything else falls into place. Look at what happens as a natural\nconsequence of superior  positioning:\n“THE POSITION ASCENSION LOOP ”\n1. Increased Positioning Leads to Increased  Perception\nPerception  is reality.  At the end of the day, the chiropractor  who is “perceived”  as the best will benefit\nmore  than the chiropractor  who may actually  in reality  be the best. I’m not saying  you shouldn’t  work\nto become  the best.  I’m simply  saying  that perception  is essential!\n2. Increased Perception Leads To Enhanced  Expectation\nWhen peoples’ expectations are enhanced, you are able to break away from feeling like you always\nhave to compete on price. Why? Because their expectations are now different. They don’t expect you\nto be just like every other chiropractor.\n3. Enhanced Expectat ion Leads To Increased  Anticipation\nThe science  behind  anticipation  is so cool. I could  totally  geek out on it BIG TIME,  but I’ll spare  you the\ntechno babble. To put it simply, increased anticipation floods the brain with powerful chemicals that\ncause  an attraction,  or a pull, towards  the thing  they are anticipating.  I first learned  about  this in a really\n| DR. CHAD  W O O L N E R  62\ncool book called,  Suggestible  You, where  they discuss  the deep science  behind  all this and a lot of other\ncool stuff.  The bottom  line is, increasing  anticipation  is powerful!\n4. Increased Anticipation Creates Superior  Outcomes\nAgain,  from that same  book,  we learn  that there  is real science  showing  that if a persons’  anticipation\nincreases,  so does the likelihood  of a superior  outcome  from their experience.  Call it the placebo  effect.\nCall it whatever  you like. At the end of the day, I simply  call it a way to get better  results.\n5. Superior Outcomes  Leads To  Strengthened  Reputation\nOne of the most fundamental  consequences  of achieving  superior  results  for the people  you serve  is\nthat your reputation  will be strengthened.  If you’ve  read the book,  The Thank  You Economy  by Gary\nVaynerchuk,  you know  the importance  of your reputation  online  these  days.\n6. Strengthened Reputation Reinforces Superior  Positioning\nThe power  of strengthening  your reputation  is that it feeds  right back into the end result  we are after,\nand that is superior  positioning.\nWhat’s powerful about this is that it’s the key from shifting away from that new patient roller coaster\nto a far more  sustainable  form of growth  for your practice.  There’s  an almost  “snowball -like” effect  that\ntakes  place  when  you begin  to achieve  superior  positioning.\nBack to capturing  success  stories.  Let’s assume  I went  full steam  ahead  and did my Epic Event  at a\nmovie  theater  somewhere  between  week  12 to 14. This means  that by that time I should  have captured\naround  6 to 8 success  stories.  Wouldn’t  it be far more  effective  for my movie  event  if instead  of playing\nnothing  on the big screen  as people  are filing  into their seats,  they played  my success  stories  that I\ncaptured  on video?  That is exactly  what  I do.\nI don’t use a bunch of fancy equipment. All I need is a smartphone and a good background. First, I\ninterview  my clients.  I get them  to tell me their story in the most raw, real and vulnerable  way possible.\nI want to make  it as natural -feeling  as possible.  Once I’ve finished  the interview,  I get some  additional\nfootage of them doing something they love doing. Maybe it’s skateboarding. Maybe it’s a walk  through\na park. Maybe it’s just some footage of them in my clinic. Once I’ve got both the interview and the\nfootage  of them  doing  their “thing,”  whatever  that might  be, I’ll throw  the footage  into a simple  video\nediting  software  like iMovie  and splice  it together.  I keep the editing  simple,  cutting  out the parts  where\nI’m asking  the actual  questions.  That way, it’s just a series  of answers  from the person.  To keep it from\nlooking like just a bunch of clips cut and pasted together, I’ll overlay the additional footage (known  in\nthe industry  as “B-Roll” footage)  on top of the cuts. It will look like a mix of the interview  with occasional\nclips of them  walking,  biking,  hiking,  fishing,  etc. Last but not least,  I’ll throw  in some  emotional  music.\nI purchase royalty -free music for relatively small costs from AudioJungle.com. And…voila! I’ve got an\nengaging,  emotional  story that I can use to showcase  my business!  Ultimately,  what I want to create  is\nwhat I refer to as a “lifestyle  piece.”  What  this means  to me is that I have created  a powerful  story that\nmany  people  will be able to relate  to. Relatability  = belief.  Belief  = new patients.\nMy mission at this point (from week 7 into infinity) is to create more success story videos. I want to\naverage at least 1 per week. Can you imagine what your practice would be like if you did this for an\nentire year? Can you imagine how powerful it would b e to have nearly 50 case studies showing how\ngreat your clinic is?\n| DR. CHAD  W O O L N E R  63\nWith a wide range  of case studies,  I’ll then be able to have the flexibility  to market  to whatever  niche(s)\nI choose.  This is why the Proof  Funnel  Map is a lot more  simple.  It’s meant  to be flexible.\nI use a wide range  of traffic  sources  and drive  them  to what  I call“Proof  Pages”.  These  are simply  wherever\nI choose to showcase my success stories or case studies. Again, I use the Ongoing Communication\nSystem  (OCS)  as a way to grow my audience,  both patients  and non-patients  alike.  This further  helps\nprovide  stability  through  improving  patient  retention  and re-activation.\nThe purpose  of the marathon  phase  isn’t to rapidly  bring  in more  new patients.  Hopefully  I’ve made\nit clear that the purpose of this phase is to start creating stability. You create stability when you\nestablish  superior  positio ning.  Again,  using  ClickFunnels  as an example,  this is EXACTLY  what  they\ndid. The minute  they started  gaining  some  traction  with their software,  they immediately  went  to work\ncapturing  these  incredible  success  stories.  This allowed  them  to establish  themselves  as the premier\nfunnel building  software.\nYour goal in business  is not to“compete”,  and it’s not even to“dominate.”  No, you want  to go even further.\nYou do this by establishing  superior  positioning  and making  your competition  completely  irrelevant!\nThat should  be your ultimate  goal:  make  every  other  option  completely  and utterly  irrelevant.  Guess\nwhat’s  going  to get you there?  That’s  right,  a solid funnel  strategy.\nCONCLUSION\nIf this chapter  did nothing  else for you, hopefully  it shows  you the power  of what  you can accomplish\nin 100 days.  Seriously,  I wish I had this type of strategy  and direction  in place  when  I first started  into\nmy practice.  I was just trying  to spin my wheels  however  and wherever  I could  to try and make  things\nhappen.  I had no real plan,  so to speak,  but here you now have in front  of you a very real, tactical  plan at\nyour fingertips  that you can use to get at least 100 new patients  (or customers)  in 100 days.  I know  this\nhas been primarily  focused  around  chiropractors,  but hopefully  you see that these  same  strategies\n| DR. CHAD  W O O L N E R  64\ncould  just as easily  be applied  to dentists,  orthodontists,  lawyers,  accountants,  physical  therapists,\nand just about  any service -based  business.\nPhase 1: The Sprint Phase\nIn this phase,  I established  a predictable  workshop  funnel  that was averaging  at least 6 new patients  per\nweek  (2 new patients  per workshop  x 3 workshops  per week).  This was the backbone  (no pun intended\nchiropractors  ;) of my marketing  funnel  strategy.  By the end of 14 weeks,  I should  have totaled  84 new\npatients!  More importantly,  what  this also should  have done is established  a solid,  predictable  way to\ngenerate  an average  of a baseline  of 24 new patients  per month.  Not bad!\nPhase 2: The Surge Phase\nHere I ran an Epic Event funnel and had around 200 -300 people show up, signing up 20 new patients as\na result. This brought me to my 100 new patients goal, woohoo! Again, the power here isn’t just in\nwhat was achieved at that point, but also the fact that I’m now able to rinse and repeat. I’ll  continue\nrunning the Epic Funnel  every quarter or so to bring in a predictable surge of new activity into my\npractice  to help strengthen  my growth.\nPhase 3: The Marathon Phase\nLast but not least,  I established  superior  positioning  in my community.  The key to making  this happen\nis capturing  and creating  a portfolio  of success  stories  or case studies  and then using  the Proof  Funnel\nlong-term to help drive  in niche  specific  patients  into my practice.\nNow go make  it happen  for yourself!  Seriously,  if there  is nothing  else that I have learned  from Russell\nand other successful entrepreneurs, it is this: Action and implementation are the real secret. Ideas are\ngreat,  but unless  there  is sufficient  action  taken  to bring  those  ideas  to life, they are distractions.  I hope\nthat doesn’t  sound too harsh.  I just want you to succeed.  I know  firsthand  the pain and bitterness\nassociated with the struggle of business, and I feel a personal sense of mission and purpose to help\nother entrepreneurs (chiropractors especially) serve more people and have a greater impact on their\ncommunities. I know it might sound a bit cli che, but I sincerely believe that we have all been blessed\nwith a specific set of skills and gifts that were intended to reach and serve a very specific group of\npeople in the world. What a shame it would be if we didn’t do everything within our power to r each\nthose  people  so that we were allowed  to serve  them  at the highest  level possible.\nLastly,  just remember  this: making  money  and serving  others  are not mutually  exclusive  ideas.  On the\ncontrary,  money  can be and must be a direct  reflection  of the value  we create  in the world!\n| BR ICK & MOR TAR FU N N E L  S 65\nDavid Frey\nChief Marketer of FitHealthy\nDavid  Frey lives in Houston,  Texas,  with Ingrid,  his wife of 29 years.\nHe has two amazing,  awesome,  wonderful  children  whom  he adopted\nat birth.

I hoped that we could strike up a\nrelationship  and that person  would  send me referrals.\nUsually  the sponsor  of the networking  event  would  bring  in an educational  speaker  to provide  value\nto the event.  The speaker  was usually  another  local business  owner  who was promoting  their local\nbusiness  through  public  speaking.\nAs I sat through  these  meetings,  I noticed  that the most popular  and most respected  people  in the\nroom  were (1) the promoter  of the event  and (2) the speaker  at the event.  At the end of the meeting,  I\nnoticed  that many  of the attendees  of the event  would  circle  around  the speaker  to ask more  questions\nor just meet  the person.\nWhen  I saw this, I asked  myself,  “Why  can’t  I be the speaker  that gets invited  to speak  at these  events?”\nInstead  of meeting  people  one-on-one, I could  meet  the entire  group  of people  in a way that would\nposition  me as a trusted  local expert.  From that point  on, I vowed  that I would  never  attend  another\nlocal event  unless  I was the speaker.  Quickly  I became  a popular  speaker  on the local speaking  circuit.\nI spoke  at breakfast  meetings,  local association  meetings,  business  office  lunch -and-learns  and large\nnetworking  meetings.  Business  started  booming.\nMy next step was to hold my own local speaking  events.  I’d rent a room  at the local Small  Business\nDevelopment  Center  (SBDC)  and use their logo to promote  my events.  People  flooded  into my events,\nin part,  because  they thought  it was sponsored  by the local SBDC.  Business  went  wild!  (NOTE:  Please\nensure  that business  is okay with you using  their  logo first.)\nWhy am I telling  you all this? Today,  Facebook  gives  you the power  to do what  I was doing  back in the\nday without  even leaving  your home!  You can become  a local business  rockstar  just using  organic  (no\npaid ads) Facebook!  You can meet  local people,  interact  with them,  do webinars,  do Facebook  lives,\nhave private  message  conversations  and develop  real relationships  with people  all from the comfort  of\nyour own home  office.\nStatistics  say that around  7 out of 9 U.S. adults  are on Facebook.  Depending  on where  you live, that\nmeans  that 7 out of 9 adults  who live in your local city are on Facebook.  That’s  a lot of local potential\ncustomers,  patients  or clients  that are on Facebook  right in your local city.\nIn this chapter,  I’m not going  to show  you how to use Facebook  ads. I’m not going  to show  you how to\nuse ClickFunnels  landing  pages.  There  are other  resources  that can do that.  I’m going  to explain  how\nto create  a large  community  of local followers  who live in your city that know,  like and trust you and will\nrefer you to their local friends  and family  members  using  Facebook.\nIf I was starting from scratch in a local city and I offered a service, could be any service, this is what I\nwould do step -by-step.\n| D AVID  FRE Y 67\nSTEP 1: CREATE A NEW FACEBOOK ACCOUNT JUST FOR\nLOCAL FRIENDS*\nDISCLAIMER: Look into Facebook’s Terms of Service to see if they allow this before trying this.\nFirst,  I would  create  a new personal  Facebook  profile  just for my local friends,  prospects  or potential\nreferral  sources.  This is the profile  I’m going  to use to make  a local splash.  Here are some  advantages\nof using  a brand  new local Facebook  profile:\n• I have the potential  of friending  and accepting  friend  requests  from 5,000  local people.\n• I have a much  greater  reach  on my own profile.\n• I can gently  promote  my business  without  any of my followers  complaining.\n• Likes  and comments  will allow  my posts  to be seen by friends  of friends  (more  viral).\n• People  know  there  is a real person  behind  a personal  profile,  so there’s  more  trust.\nWhy not use my existing Facebook account?\nI can if I want, especially if I am already connected to a lot of local people and don’t mind using that\naccount for my own personal business uses, but my long term goal would be to use all 5,000 of those\nfriend al locations that Facebook gives me for local people rather than relatives and past friends that\nlive in different cities.\nWhy not use a business Facebook page?\nI’m not going to use a Facebook page when trying to build my business organically through Facebook\nbecause my Facebook page gets very little reach. When I post something, it’ll only be seen by a small\npercentage of people. Plus, I’ll get a much better response when I promote my business through my\npersonal profile if I do it the way that is explained i n this chapter.\nWhy not use a Facebook  group?\nI won’t  use a Facebook  group  because  I want  to cast a wide net and reach  prospects  that have never\nheard  of my business  and/or  have not yet become  customers.  If I create  a general  local Facebook  group,\nmy local friends  would  expect  me not to promote  my own business  in the group.  Let me explain:  if I start\na local city group  that was open to everyone  called,  “Friendswood  Moms  and Dads”  or “Friendswood\nFriends,”  the people  in my group  would  expect  me not to advertise  or promote  my own business  in the\ngroup  (unless  they could  also).  If everyone  was promoting  their own businesses,  no one would  want  to\nremain  a member  of that group.\nIf I start a company  group  called,  let’s say, “Friendswood  Frey Chiropractic”,  very few would  want to join\nthat group, especially people who have never heard of me. Remember, my objective is to cast a wide\nnet and generate  new leads.\nHOW TO CREATE A LEAD GENERATING PERSONAL  PROFILE\nWhen  I start becoming  more  visible  to people,  they are naturally  going  to visit my profile  page to find out\nwho I am and get to know  more  about  me. The highest  traffic  page on a typical  website  is the “About”\npage. People are curious about people. They want to know details about my personal life. Most, if not\nall, of my Facebook  friends  (especially  potential  friends)  will peruse  my personal  profile.\n| D AVID  FRE Y 68\nCreate a Lead Generation Offer(s)\nThe first thing  I need to do is to create  something  that I can give away  for free that my target  market\nwill want.  This could  be an eReport,  eBook,  audio  MP3, a video  or something  else that would  require\nsomeone  to either  give me their email  address  or private  message  me through  Facebook  Messenger\n(using  ManyChat  software  or something  like it).\nThe next thing I need to do is create a way for people to get access to it. This is where ClickFunnels\ncomes in. With ClickFunnels, I can set up any type of landing page I want to capture leads. There are\nmany different landing page templates from which to choose; ClickFunnels gives you many ‘out of  the\nbox’.\nThe final thing  is to purchase  a domain  or URL from a service  like Godaddy.com  or NameCheap.com.\nThis is important.  I will make  sure the word “free”  and my city’s  name  is in the URL. Doing  that will\ndramatically  increase  the amount  of leads  I will generate.  I’ve tested  this with many  small  business\nprofessionals.  Here are some  ideas  using  my city’s  name  for URLs for different  professionals:\n(Disclaimer: Domain ownership and content may have changed since the time this chapter was\npublished!

On my profile\nbanner,  I’m going  to place  a professional  photo  of myself  and an irresistible  offer  that will entice  my\nperfect  prospect  to request  it from me. Below  is an example  I created  for a local realtor.  Notice  that I:\n• Highlighted  the name  of my local city,\n• Presented an irresistible offer that just about any local person would take me up on, whether\nthey’re  selling  their home  or not, and\n• Choose  a URL to go to that has the word “free”  and the city name  on it.\nThe solid color  background  really  makes  a viewer  focus  on the offer.  Notice  that I have the woman  in\nthe banner  pointing  to the offer  as well.  This is a perfect,  local lead generating  personal  profile  banner.\nWrite a Compelling, Lead Generating “Details About You” Section\nThe most important  section  on my Facebook  profile  behind  my banner  is the“Details  About  You” section.\nThis is the area where  I can write  anything  I want.  I want to make  this area interesting,  captivating  and\nlead generating.  I like to use humor,  so here’s  a great  “Details  About  You” section  I wrote  up:\n(continued)\n| D AVID  FRE Y 70\nDon’t Forget the Website Section\nThere’s also a “website” section where I can list all my lead generating ClickFunnels landing pages /\nfunnels.  With ClickFunnels,  I can create  multiple  funnels  or landing  pages  on one ClickFunnels  account,\nand I can buy multiple  URLs that attach  to each landing  page or funnel.  Here’s  an example  of a website\nsection on a Facebook profile that has several ClickFunnels landing pages / funnels with their own URLs\nthat have the ability  to generate  a lead.\nThat’s all it takes to set up a lead generating Facebook profile. If I become friends with a lot of local\npeople  and create  some  great  content,  which  I’ll talk about  in just a moment,  I’ll generate  a lot of leads\nright through my  profile.\n| D AVID  FRE Y 71\nSTEP 2: START FRIENDING ALL OF MY EXISTING LOCAL FRIENDS\nNext,  I will make  a list of all the local people  I know  or that I have met: teachers,  dentists,  doctors,\nchiropractors,  neighbors,  mail persons,  church  members,  PTA members,  and more.  These  will be the\nfirst people  I will send friend  requests  to.\nWhen  I’m friending  people,  I’ll be careful  not to friend  more  than 20 people  a day. Often  Facebook  sees\nit as spamming  when  a user tries to friend  too many  people  in the same  day.\nIn this step,  I will also send friend  requests  to my previous  customers,  including  newer  customers.\nThese  will become  some  of my best referral  sources  on Facebook.\nSTEP 3: FRIEND MY LOCAL DREAM 100\nWhen  doing  local networking  on Facebook,  I want to find out who the 100 biggest  local influencers  are\nthat participate  on Facebook.  My first duty is to create  an online  relationship  with those  100 people.\nTo do that,  I will start by making  a list of all the business  categories  that are good referral  sources  for\nme. For instance,  if were a carpet  cleaner,  good referral  sources  might  be:\n• realtors\n• carpet  retailers\n• beauty salon  employees\n• home cleaning  companies\n• receptionists  in realtors  and insurance  offices\n• chemical/equipment supply  shops\n• interior  designers\n• contractors\n• home  stagers\n• home restoration  business\n• chamber  of commerce  members\n• title companies\nNow that I have the categories  of companies  that are good referral  sources  for me, I will start finding\nout who the owners  are or who the employees  are. Usually,  the local Chamber  of Commerce  has a\nlisting  of local businesses  and their owners.\nHOW TO PROPERLY DO A FACEBOOK FRIEND REQUEST\n1. Now that I have lists of all the people I want to start friend requesting, I will find them on\nFacebook and make sure they are active. I’ll go to their profiles and see if they are posting\nthings on Facebook. If they aren’t, I’ll scratch them off my list. I only want to f riend request\npeople  I’ll be able to interact  with on Facebook.\n| D AVID  FRE Y 72\n2. Next,  I’ll go to a few of their posts  and add a comment.  I can add an insight,  congratulate  them\nor share a positive thought with them. I’ll do that for a couple of days before I send a friend\nrequest.  I want to warm  them  up by helping  them  to see me before  I send a friend  request.  I’ll\nkeep my friend  requests  organized by  keeping  a list of people  that I want to interact  with that\nday. I can even split my screen on my computer, keeping my spreadsheet open on one half of\nthe screen  and Facebook  open on the other.\n3. After a few interactions with that person, I’ll then send them a friend request. I’ll be sure to\nsend a brief private message with my friend request just letting them know that I’ve just\nstarted a local business and am trying to get to know some local people. I’ll always be honest\nwith people;  they’ll  respect  me for that. The chances  of them  approving  my friend  request  will\nincrease.\nWHAT TO DO IN THE FIRST 30 DAYS AFTER FRIENDING A NEW PERSON\nMany times I will accept a friend request from someone else, but then they never interact with me. It\nmakes one wonder why they even sent the friend request in the first place. Whenever I send a friend\nrequest  to someone,  I start interacting  with them  every  day for the first 30 days or so. This allows  them\nto get to see me and know  me as well as recognize  my name  and profile  picture.\nAgain,  I will have a list of people  and track  my daily comments  on their posts  or replies  to their comments\non someone else’s posts, making sure that every one of my interactions are positive. No politics. No\nreligion.  Just positive  comments.\nHere is an example of what a simple tracking spreadsheet might look like:\nPERSON\nJane Smith  Day 1\nX Day 2\nX Day 3\nX FRIEND\nX Day 5\nX Day 6\nX Day 7  Day 8\nJohn Smith  X X X X X X\nJoe Smithers  X X X X X X\nJack Smithington  X X X X X X\nJaime Smithson  X  X\nJon Smythe  X  X\nLest you think  this is a tedious  task, just remember  how people  used to do it in the old days,  and still\ndo it today.  They’d  have to spend  half their day going  to a local networking  event  to meet  maybe  two or\nthree  people.  On Facebook,  you can meet  15-20 and even a lot more  per day. That’s  a pretty  efficient\nuse of your time.  Take your Facebook  networking  seriously!\n| D AVID  FRE Y 73\nSTEP 4: JOIN LOCAL FACEBOOK GROUPS\nThis is the step where I can really ramp up my efforts because there’s lots of local Facebook groups\nthat have hundreds  and even thousands  of local people  interacting  with each other.  I can find hundreds\nand even thousands  of local citizens  that can become  part of my Facebook  network.\nTo do this, I just type in the name  of my city into Facebook  and click on “groups.”  Facebook  will show a\nlot of the biggest  local facebook  groups  in the search  results.  I’ll look for the most active  people  in the\ngroups. I’ll check out their profiles and see if they’re active on Facebook in general and whether they\nhave a lot of friends.  I will look to see if they’re  members  of a local church  or if they have a full time job.\nThese  are the type of people  who interact  with others  a lot and can refer you to a lot of people.\nSTEP 5: START CREATING A COMMUNITY OF LOCAL  FRIENDS\nAND FOLLOWERS THAT KNOW, LIKE AND TRUST ME\nNow it’s time to start ramping  up my efforts  to create  a warm  community  of local Facebook  friends  and\nfollowers  that know,  like and trust me. The way I do that is two fold.\n| D AVID  FRE Y 74\n1. ENGAGE WITH  PEOPLE\nEngage  with lots of people  every  day! I keep friending  at least 20 people  every  day and keep a\ntracking  sheet  of who I am friending.  I will consistently  interact  with them,  especially  in the first\n30 days.  I need to dedicate  and schedule  “Facebook  Networking”  time every  day, spending  2-3\nhours  a day networking  online  in the beginning.  This is the beginning  stage  of creating  a local\ncommunity  of people  that will continue  to send me referrals.\n2. CREATE ENGAGING  CONTENT\nCreating really engaging content for my local friends is how I’m going to become slightly\nfamous  in my local city. When  I create  really  good,  engaging  content,  people  are going  to like\nand comment  on my posts.  When  they do, their  friends  are going  to see my posts  and like and\ncomment  on them,  too.\nNOTE: When someone who lives locally and is not yet a Facebook friend likes or makes a positive\ncomment on my posts, I immediately send them a friend request!\nRULES FOR CREATING ENGAGING CONTENT\nHere are the four rules I follow when creating engaging content on Facebook:\n• NEVER  post political  or religious  stuff.\n• NEVER disagree with anyone on my own posts or when I comment on anyone else’s posts.\nAlways  keep it very positive.  If I can’t  agree  with them  or add something  positive,  I will not\ncomment.\n• Keep it local.  Post funny,  interesting,  valuable  stuff about  my local city.\n• Sprinkle  in indirect  promotional  business  stuff about  every  1 in 10 posts.\n20 UNIQUE IDEAS FOR CREATING ENGAGING LOCAL CONTENT\nUnderstanding why it is critical to post\nengaging  content  isn’t difficult,  but trying  to\ncome  up with ideas  about  what  to post can\nbe! Here are 20 unique  ideas  I will use when\nbrainstorming  posts.\n1. Local Feel Good  Stories\nI will comb through the local television\nstation  websites,  local newspaper  websites\nand anywhere  else I can find local “feel  good”\nstories and then share them or recreate   a\npost about them in my own words with a\nphoto or video. I’ll add my own opinion\nabout  the story  to my post.\n| D AVID  FRE Y 75\n2. Local  Youth  Sports  Achievements\nA lot of local folks are fans of local high school sports teams. They like to keep up -to-date on what’s\nhappening. In my hometown, they go crazy over our local high school’s football team.\n3. Local History  Photos\nI’m a member  of a group  that’s  dedicated  just to posting  old photos  of the city I grew up in. The photos\nalways  capture  my attention,  and I can quickly  tell you the name  of the person  who posts  them.  If I\nwanted  to post the same  thing,  I would  go to my local library  or local places  of government  to see if I\ncan find sources  for old photos  of the city I live in. I would  need to either  scan them  or take photos  of\nthem.  There  are probably  books  about  my local city that have lots of old photos  in them,  too.\n4. Photos of Local  Events\nI’ll get outside  and start attending  local events.  While  I’m there,  I’ll take photos  and post them  on my\nprofile.  I’ll add some  funny  or positive  comments  and ask people  if they attended.\n5. Funny Local  Signs\nIf I ever come across a funny local sign or see\nthat someone else has posted a photo of a\nfunny local sign, I’ll share it. Even if it’s not a\nsign in my hometown,  I can still post it anyway.\nThese  images  get a lot of likes and shares.\n6. Reviews  of Books  and Websites  about\nYour Local  City\nUndoubtedly  there  are books  about  my local city I can read and review.  They might  be history  books,\nsightseeing  books,  local day trip books,  novels  and even cook books.\n7. Local  Historical  Facts  and Stories\nIn the books  I mentioned  in #6 I’ll find interesting  historical  and modern  day facts and stories  about  my\nlocal city. Local  people  would  find this stuff very interesting.\n8. Local  Store  Walkthrough  Videos\nNot everyone has been in all the stores in my local city. If I’m out and about, I’ll whip out my phone\ncamera  and do a walkthrough  video  of the store and stuff I find interesting  there.  If the owner  is there\nand open to doing  a brief 2 minute  interview  with me, local people  would  find that interesting.\n| D AVID  FRE Y 76\n9. People  of [Insert  City Name]\n“Humans of New York” is a popular Facebook\npage which shares stories and photos of people\nof New York. The page has 18 million followers!\nThe people  of my city would  go crazy  over these\ntypes of posts done, of course, about their own\nneighbors.  All I’d have to do is start interviewing\nlocal people about interesting parts of their\nlives.  These  posts  will get shared  like crazy.\n10. Local Restaurant  Reviews\nI will become a “foodie” and start eating out\nmore. While there, I will take photos of the\nrestaurant  and do a review,  trying  to make  it as\npositive  as possible.  I won’t  give the restaurant\na number of stars. I’ll just talk about what I\nliked about the restaurant. If I didn’t like the\nrestaurant, I won’t post a review about it.\nRemember,  I want  to establish  a reputation  as\na super positive, likeable and trusting  person,\nso I need t o stay away from posting anything\ndivisive,  controversial  or negative.\n11. “Where  Am I?” Photos\nPeople like to try and identify places in their\nlocal city. I could have some fun with that and\ntake some selfies in different locations, asking\npeople to tell me where I was when the photo\nwas taken.\n12. Popular Viral  Videos\nPeople love funny, strange, shocking and\nheartwarming viral videos. I can pick out  viral\nvideos from Dailypicksandflicks.com to share\non my Facebook  profile.\n13. Local  “How  Do I” Videos\nI will make  some  simple  videos  showing  people  how to do things  in my local city. How do I renew  my\ndriver’s  license?  How do I challenge  my property  taxes  appraisal?  How do I vote?  How do I rent a pavilion\nat a local park?  How do I find out about  summer  activities  the city offers?  How do I rent a mailbox  for a\nhome  business?  These  are simple  videos  that will get passed  around  to other  local people.\n| D AVID  FRE Y 77\n14. My Favorite  Place  Videos\nI will shoot  simple  videos  or snap selfie  photos\nof my favorite  places,  sharing  what  I like about\nthem. I might even include a short interview\nwith the owners.  What’s  my favorite  local gym,\ngas station,  hair salon,  grocery  store,  pool,  park,\npaper copy shop, hardware store,  electronics\nstore, dance studio, coffee shop, tailor  shop,\ncar wash?\n16. Who Is My Favorite  Professional\nJust about everyone has their favorite service\nprovider or knows a good service provider.\nThese could be great referral sources for me.\nService providers include such professions as  a\ndentist,  insurance  agent,  pest control  service,\nauto repair shop, family doctor, chiropract or,\nhandyman, lawn care service, carpet cleaner,\nfinancial planner, plumber, and pool care\nprovider. When I post a positive review for the\nservice provider, I will make sure they know\nabout  it.\n17. Local Police  Reports\nI will go to my local city’s website and find up -\nto-date news about  my local city and post it on\nmy profile with some words of caution. Local\npeople  will appreciate  me for it.\n18. Fun Local  Memes\nI will take snapshots of local places, things and\npeople to create good -hearted or funny\nmemes. Below is an example of a meme I\ncreated using ToonyTool.com, which was free\nand fast.\n| D AVID  FRE Y 78\n19. Local  Events\nLocal  folks want  to know  about  events  happening  in or near their city. To find local events,  I will just go\nto Google  and type in “[name  of your local city] + events”.  I will get a list of events  happening  in and near\nmy local city. I can click on the tab that says “this month”,  and I’ll get all the events  happening  during\nthe month.  I might  even find a local “Goat  Yoga”  event!  I will screenshot  the event  and post it on my\nFacebook  profile  with a few comments.\n20. Local  City Informational  Posts\nI will go to my local city’s website and find a ton of different information that would be of interest to\nlocal citizens. I just visited my local city’s website, and there’s over a thousand pieces of information\nthat would make for a great informational Facebook post that locals would  be interested in knowing.\nI’ll always  use the name  of my city in my post titles.  Here are some  titles  I came  up with after spending\njust a few minutes  on my local city’s  website:\n• How to Get a Friendswood  Construction  Permit  Before  You Make  Alterations  on Your Home\n• How to Report  a Local  Friendswood  Code  Violation  When  You See It\n• Do You Have a “Junk  Vehicle”  that Is In Danger  of Getting  Towed?\n• If You Live In Friendswood  and Have a Pool,  Read This...\n• Want  to Work for the City of Friendswood?

Perhaps  for every  10 relationship  building  content\nposts,  I can post one business  building  promotional  post.\nOne other  point:  with any of these  information  business  post ideas,  I can ask people  to think  about  a\nfriend  that would  benefit  from  this post,  and ask them  to tag a friend  in the comments.  That is\na referral,  and it’s surprising  how many  people  will actually  do just that.\nHere are 10 examples of good promotional business building posts I will use:\n1. Funny Fiverr Gif  Videos\nI will go to Fiverr.com  and pay $20 to have a local viral video  produced.  Seriously,  people  love strange,\nunusual  and funny  videos.  For instance,  I can send this puppeteer  a photo  of my local business,  and he\ncan use it as a backdrop  in the video.\n(https:// www.fiverr.com/puppetpals )\nI can also have custom rap songs, dance videos, “chatting dog on a laptop” videos, inflatable  dinosaur\ncostume  videos,  singing  videos,  and birthday  videos  made.  I can have videos  made  with people  dressed\nup like flowerman,  an ape, pirate,  twins,  a witch,  and other  strange,  unusual  costumes  all promoting  my\nlocal business.\nYou might  say to yourself,  “I want  people  to take me seriously,  so I’d never  create  a video  like that.”  Trust\nme, people  like people  who make  them  laugh  and who don’t  take themselves  too seriously.  These  are\nthe types  of videos  that get people  talking.  The real key to these  videos  is to write  a funny,  powerful\nscript.  In my videos,  I will talk about  the benefits  of my business  but use humor  throughout  to lighten\nthe mood.\n| D AVID  FRE Y 80\n2. Customer  Stories\nPeople love a good story, and I can tell my\nfollowers what I do through a customer’s\nstory.  When  I write  out the story,  I will use the\n“PBR” formula. PBR stands for “problem,\nsolution, results”. I will explain the problem\nthat my customer was experiencing which\nled them to come to me. I will describe the\nsolution I used to resolve it. I will share the\npositive results they’re now experiencing  as\na result  of working  with me.\n3. Facebook  Lives\nFacebook  allowsusersto“golive”(broadcast\nlive video)  using  their smartphones  with the\nFacebook app. With the press of a button,\nI can broadcast online in real time. As of\nthis writing,  I’ll get more  people  watching\nmy Facebook live videos than reading\nregular  posts  and uploaded  videos.  In fact,\naccording to Facebook, live videos  get an\naverage of 6x as many interactions as\nregular  videos!\nFacebook lives are great to use for Q & A’s,\nshort presentations,  demonstrations,  sharing\ntips, doing  interviews,  broadcasting  an event,\nshowing  off company  culture,  and more.\n4. Time  Lapse  Customer  Videos\nI will ask the customer if I can take a time\nlapse video of myself performing my service\nfor them. It could be anything you do from\nmowing a lawn to dentistry work. Time  lapse\nvideos are captivating and allow my prospects\nto see me or my service  “in action.”\n5. Before  and After  Customer  Photos\nThese posts are just like my “Customer Stories” posts, but I will use before and after photos. These\ntypes of customer photos are often seen in weight loss ads, but they can actually be used in a lot of\ndifferent things such as: teeth whitening and straightening, home painting, cosmetic surgery, roofing,\nlandscaping, auto collision repair, home staging, and more. All that is required is that there is some\ntype of transformation that occurred once my se rvice was performed, and just about every service\ncreates a transformation.\n| D AVID  FRE Y 81\nIf my service or product doesn’t produce\na tangible  transformation  that is visible  to\nthe naked  eye, I can still use the ‘before  and\nafter’  photo  concept.  For instance,  let’s say\nI was a chiropractor.  If my customer  will go\nalong  with it, I can ask if I can take a “sad\nface”  photo  and a “happy  face”  photo  after\ntheir treatment.  In a photo  editor,  I will put\nboth photos side -by-side and put a brief\ndescription under each photo. Here’s an\nexample  to further  illustrate  this strategy:\n6. Behind -the-Scenes\nI will share photos or videos of my\nemployees doing their work behind -the-\nscenes. I will take viewers into my office\nand show  them  what  my workspace  looks\nlike. I will show  them  little  secrets  about  my\nbusiness  that the average  person  wouldn’t\nknow.  All businesses  have them.  I will shoot\na short video of each of my employees\nexplaining briefly what they do in the\ncompany.  I can compile  them  into a single\nvideo.  I have a friend  who charged  $2,000\nper person to have a “behind -the-scenes\noffice visit” with h im and his employees,\nand he has a waiting  list for that offer!  I can\noffer  that same  experience  to my audience\nfor free on Facebook  or as a teaser,  leaving\nthem  wanting  to see more.\n7. Question  and Answer  Videos\nPeople love Q&A videos. In the video, I will\nread the question or create a slide for  each\nof the most common questions and then\nrecord my answers. I will keep my answers\nbrief and to the point to make the video a\nlittle more fast -paced. Then, I will  compile\nthe questi on slides and video answers into\none Q&A video. I can also just keep it to one\nquestion per video if I want. It leaves  a little\nmore  time to go more  in-depth  on the\nanswer and still keep the video to around\n3-5 minutes.\n| D AVID  FRE Y 82\n8. Demo  Videos\nIf I have a product that can be demonstrated, I will create a video showing how it works. If I use my\ncreativity, I can create demo videos for most anything. How about a demo video showing how easy it\nis to buy insurance? I will just shoot a short video goin g through each step and put them all together in\none video. I can do that for about any small business service. Service providers like accountants,\nfinancial planners, marketing consultants, computer repairmen can all do demo videos by just doing\nshort 15 second videos of each step in the process and combining them together in one video.\nCreating demo videos for businesses\nthat have viewable, tangible results  are\neven easier.  Businesses  offering  services\nsuch as carpet  cleaning,  power  washing,\nlandscaping, window washing, tiling\nand pool cleaning can all create simple\ndemo  videos  showing  prospects  how the\nservice is delivered and showing them\nbefore  and after  results.\n9. Giveaway  Posts\nI talked  earlier  about  having  lead magnets\nto give away  to people  to generate  leads.\nI will also do that with a really simple\ngiveaway  post.  I will either  send people  to\na custom URL as I mentioned before, or\nI can use a Facebook  marketing  software\nlike Manychat which uses Facebook\nmessenger  to capture  leads.\nI will make the offer in my post and ask\npeople to comment with a particular\npredetermined word in the comment\nsection of my post. Manychat will then\nsend that person a message and add them\nto a “Messenger chat list.” I can program\nthe software to send a message like, “Hi,\nthank you for requesting my free report.\nClick on the link to  download it now.” The\nlink I will provide is the custom link that\nwill send the person to my landing page\nwhere they’ll have to give their email\naddress in exchange for the report. Doing\nthe giveaway this way, I’ll build my\nMessenger chat list and my email  list,\nwhich  will give me two different ways in\nthe future to follow up with that person.\nTo the right you’ll see a perfect example\nof a giveaway  post.\n| D AVID  FRE Y 83\n10. Tips Posts\nPeople  love to learn  helpful  tips. I will create  all kinds  of “tips posts”  that will add value,  build  trust and\nposition  myself  as a local authority  in my niche.  Let’s pretend  I am a local realtor  living  in my home  town\nof Friendswood.  Here’s  some  different  types  of business -oriented  tips posts  I could  create:\n• Friendswood  Home  Selling  Tips\n• Friendswood  Home  Organizational  Tips\n• Friendswood  Home  Cleaning  Tips\n• Friendswood  Home  Pet Proofing  Tips\n• Friendswood  Home  Maintenance  Tips\n• Friendswood  Home  Decor  Tips\n• Friendswood  Peaceful  Home  Tips\n• Friendswood  Tips for Reducing  Dust,  Toxins  and Chemicals  in Your Home\n• Friendswood  Home  Storm -proofing  Tips\n• Friendswood  Home  Decluttering  Tips\n• Friendswood  Home  Energy  Saving  Tips\n• Friendswood  Home  Security  Tips\n• Friendswood  Home  DIY Improvement  Tips\n• Friendswood  Home  Winterizing  Tips\n• Friendswood  Feng Shui Home  Tips\n• Friendswood  Healthy  Home  Tips\n• Friendswood  Home  Extended  Vacation  Tips\nThere  are all kinds  of tips in my area of expertise  that I can share  to educate  people.  People  will find\nmany  of them  valuable,  and it will be one more  reason  for them  to like and trust me. I will take a sheet  of\npaper  and write  down  as many  areas  of tips as I can, and then I’ll take the time myself  (or hire someone\nonline)  to compile  the tips. One post could  be a list of tips, or it could  be just one tip. For instance,  here’s\nthe title (first  line) for a tips post:  “Friendswood  Home  Maintenance  Tip #21: Ensuring  Your Pipes  Don’t\nBreak  In Cold Weather.”\nBy the way, I used the word “Friendswood” to start off these tips ideas to reiterate again just how\nimportant  it is to use the name  of my city in the first line of my posts.  If I imagine  myself  scrolling  down\nthe Facebook newsfeed,  I know  that seeing  the name  of my local city in the first line of a post is going\nto immediately  catch  my eye. I’ll most assuredly  read the post and so will my local Facebook  friends.\n| D AVID  FRE Y 84\nSTEP  6: HOW  TO GET  A SUPER  FAST  INFLUX  OF NEW  CUSTOMERS\nUSING  FACEBOOK\nNow, I don’t know if I can get 100 customers in 100 days using these methods, but I do know I can get\nsome customers very quickly using these organic Facebook referral methods and ClickFunnels.\nUsing  Facebook  ads to promote  my local business  is undoubtedly  the fastest  way to get new customers,\nbut “referral  traffic”  is the highest  quality  of traffic  I can get. Studies  have found  that traffic  that comes\nto ClickFunnels  landing  pages  through  a referral  from a friend  will buy faster,  spend  more,  buy more\nfrequently  and stay a customer  longer  than traffic  that was purchased.  So, although  I’ll get less traffic\nusing  organic  Facebook  referral  strategies,  I’ll be getting  the absolute  highest  quality  of traffic  there  is.\nHere are five different  organic  referrals  methods  using  Facebook  I will use to quickly  get a surge  of new\ncustomers,  patients  and clients.\n1. The “Refer  a Friend”  Method\nI will ask a friend  to refer me to their Facebook\nfriends. I will let them know that I’ve just\nstarted  a new business  and I’m trying  to get\nmy first customers.  Would  they be willing  to\nhelp me out? If they say “yes,”  I will ask them\nto use one of my customer  success  stories,\nif I have one. As I accumulate  more  customer\nsuccess stories, I can do this method over\nand over. Notice  in the example  below,  I’m\nsharing someone else’s story, not my own,\nbut the post still works really well. I can\ngive my friends stories and accompanying\nphotos to  use.\n2. The “Share  a Post”  Method\nI will create a  customer  success  story  post\nwith a call -to-action and just ask my\nFacebook friends if they’ll do me a huge\nfavor. Would they be so kind as to share it\nwith their friends? People always want to\nhelp other  people,  and all it takes  from their\nfriend  is to hit the “share”  button.  If they can\nadd some positive words to their share, it\nwill be even more  effective.  If the rules allow,\nI can even go into a local Facebook  group,  tell my startup  story,  provide  a link to my post and ask people\nto share  my post with their friends.  I might  get lots of people  sharing  my post and thousands  of local\npeople  seeing  it. Remember,  people  like to help people.\n| D AVID  FRE Y 85\n3. The “Can  I Use Your FB Profile”  Method\nNow this is a bit gutsy but it’s surprising\nhow well it works.  All I will do is create  a post\nthat asks my friends if I can post on their\ntimeline about my business or tag them.\nHere’s an example:\n4. The “Team  12 Referral  Group”  Method\nFor this method, I will find 11 other local\nprofessionals who use Facebook a  lot,  have\na large local following  and have stellar\nreputations.  I will ask them  to join my “Team\n12” referral group and explain to them  how\nit works.\nOnce a month, I will select a day that 11\ngroup members refer the 12th member in\nthe group on their Facebook profile. There\nwill be a system  that dictates  who refers  who. This will occur  once a month  for 12 months.  By the end\nof the year, every  person  in the group  will have been promoted  by the other  group  members.  Once  the\nyear is over, we can start all over again  the next year.\nSince we’re doing it on a specific day of the month, all the group members can go to everyone else’s\nprofile to see if they are participating. It’s built-in accountability. We can expand this idea to 24 local\nparticipants  and refer a local business  or professional  twice a month  as well. I wouldn’t  expand  it much\nbeyond that  number.\n5. The “Viral  Deal”  Method\nThis method is pretty simple. People like to share great deals with their friends, especially if they are\nlocal deals.  First of all, I will create  a deal so good that friends  can’t  help but share  it. Then I will have a\ngraphics  designer  create  a graphic  announcing  the deal.  I want to make  it look like a coupon.  I’ll put a\ndeadline  on the deal so there  is an element  of scarcity  involved.  I will post the offer to my profile  and\nask people  to print it out for themselves  and to share  it with their friends.  As the deadline  gets near, I\nwill keep reposting  the deal and let people  know  they only have a short  period  of time to take advantage\nof the  offer.\nCONCLUSION\nIf I was starting  out fresh with a new business  in a new city (or even one I’ve been living  in for a while)\nand I didn’t  have much  money  to run Facebook  ads, this is the plan I would  implement.  I would  set aside\na minimum of one hour a day every day, and my goal would be to become a social media rockstar in\nmy own  city.\nFacebook is the most powerful referral engine ever created since the dawn of time. I’m convinced you\n| D AVID  FRE Y 86\ncan generate  more  referrals  for your local business  using  Facebook  than anything  else you can do. The\nkey is to:\n• Create  engaging  content  that makes  people  laugh,  cry, think  and inspire\n• Strategically  send and receive  friend  requests  only from people  who live locally\n• Sprinkle  in soft promotional  business  posts\n• Use Clickfunnels  to capture  leads,  build  an email  and chatbot  list that you can contact  over\nand over again\nIn this chapter,  I haven’t  even touched  on how to use ClickFunnels’  email  systems  to follow  up with local\npeople.  That’s  an entirely  different  chapter  in itself,  but since  we’re  here,  I’m going  to share  one local\nemail  tactic  I used with wild success.  It’s called:\nThe Restaurant Fishbowl Method\nI wanted  to build  a large  email  list of local people,  so I went  to all the restaurants  in my city and offered\nto buy two free meals  a week  for their customers  to help bring  them  back to the restaurant.  All the\nrestaurant  had to do was place  a fishbowl  by the cash register  with a sign on it that said, “ENTER  YOUR\nBUSINESS  CARD  TO WIN TWO FREE DINNER  MEALS.”  Below  that headline  it read,  “The Winner  Will Be\nNotified Via  Email.”\nPeople  would  enter  their business  cards,  and I would  go around  each week  to pick them  up. I manually\nput them into the email system and sent out the winning free dinner coupons every week. Most\nrestaurants  turned  me down,  but some  restaurants  thought  it was a great  idea.  They didn’t  have to do\nanything,  and it generated  goodwill.\nThat was how I created  a very large  email  list of local people  pretty  fast. Then  I used that list to do joint\npromotions  with other  local business  people.  They would  promote  my business  to their email  lists, and\nI would  promote  their businesses  to mine.  They all wanted  me to advertise  their local business  to my\nemail  list so I had leverage.\n***\nWe live in a day and age where  you don’t  have to get on the local rubber  chicken  speaking  circuit  or\nwaste  half of your day several  days a week  attending  local networking  meetings.  You can become  a\nlocal influencer  without  even leaving  your office.\nIf you follow  the plan I’ve laid out, you’ll  become  one of the most well known  local people  in the city. Your\nbusiness  will boom  and referrals  will start flowing  in.\n| BR ICK & MOR TAR FU N N E L  S 87\nEmily Gang\nOwner of The Medicare Coach\nEmily  is revolutionizing  the way Americans  make  their\nMedicare  decision  to protect  their health  care rights  and\nfinancial  savings.  What  started  as a desire  to help her\ndad make  his Medicare  decision,  soon transformed  into\nher passion  to change  the way people  navigate  Medicare\nrules and insurance  company  sales tactics  to easily  make\nthe right decision  for their unique  situation.  The Medicare\nCoach  was created  in 2010 and since Emily  joined  two years\nago, she’s more than 10x’d  revenues  and increased  clients\nfrom 3 states  to 49 states  and 4 countries  through  sales,\nmarketing, and funnel strategies.\nTheMedicareCoach.com\n| EMILY  G ANG  88\nHow We Transformed  Our Local  Brick  and\nMortar  Business  Into A Large -Scale  Company\nThat Reaches Clients  Nationwide\nDo you have an insurance agency or financial service company and want to get more clients?\nYou more  than likely  have clients  through  local networks,  so when  you want  to expand  quickly,  it can be\nchallenging  through  traditional  channels.\nI’ve spent my career inside of the finance and insurance industry, and over the last three years I’ve\ngrown a company that originally had clients from 2 states to now having clients from all 50 states and\n6 coun tries.\nI’ve tried a few different programs to build the business, but my business skyrocketed once I found\nClickFunnels.\nIn this chapter,  I share  the exact  steps  I took to transform  our local brick  and mortar  business  to a larger\nscale  company  that reaches  clients  nationwide.  This is what  I would  do to acquire  100 new clients.\nPHASE 1: BUILD  YOUR SUCCESS FOUNDATION WITHOUT\nWASTING YEARS OR THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS\nPhase  1, which  includes  step 1 through  4 of this 10-step process,  is the hardest  part,  but when  done\nright,  it makes  acquiring  100 clients  very easy.\nStep 1: Get Clear on Who I Want to Serve\nOne of the mistakes I made in my first business was assuming that nearly everyone could be a client.\nThis is a critical  mistake  because  if you try to talk to everyone,  you speak  to no one. Therefore,  this first\nstep is to get clear about  who my dream  client  is.\nAction plan:\nI will make  a list of at least 20 people  who I can talk to that are current  clients  or potential  dream  clients.\nI will talk to these  people  in person  or over the phone  so I can get the most value  out of their response.\nI’ll dig deep to get to the underlying  answer  and associated  emotions.\nThe goal of these  conversations  is to understand  what  problem  I solved  for my current  clients  or what\nproblem  the potential  dream  clients  want  me to solve.\nIn my business, I would ask the following questions:\n• When  you approached  making  your Medicare  decision,  what  made  it difficult?\n• What  did you ultimately  want once you finalized  your decision?\n| EMILY  G ANG  89\n• Did other  questions  or concerns  come  up as you were making  your decision?\n• How did you feel as you approached  your decision?\n• Why did you join my program?\n• How did you feel once I was able to help you make  your decision?\n• Would  you recommend  it to your friends  and why?\nThe goal of these  questions  is to understand  the pain point  they had before  I helped  them  and the\ntransformation  I provided.  These  questions  are fundamental  to my marketing  messages.\nWhen speaking with these clients, I will be sure to take excellent notes and always use their exact\nwords,  not restate  what they’ve  told me. These  notes  will be incredibly  valuable  for sales and marketing\ncopy in future  steps.\nArmed  with all my notes,  I will go through  them  to find trends  and ultimately  pick one person  that\nwas interviewed  who I consider  to be “my dream  client”.  I will take note of their demographics  and\npsychographics  so I can easily  find them  and communicate  with them  in the future.\nInitially  when  I went  through  this step,  it felt like a waste  of time because  I wasn’t  making  sales,  but if\ndone right,  the revenue  will come  in very fast once the selling  begins.\nStep 2: Start Building a Relationship with Future Clients through Publishing\nWhether  you want more  local clients  or national  clients,  it’s going  to be essential  to get your name  and\nmessage  to them.  If you’re going  to get 100 clients,  I highly  recommend  you publish  at least five times\na week  and don’t  delay  publishing.  Ideally,  you will be publishing  by day five in this 100 day process.\nThe key to getting clients outside your network is building a relationship, just like how you do when a\nclient  walks  into your office.  Don’t  overthink  this part as it can delay  getting  your message  out, which\nbuilds  the relationship  for future  clients.\nAction plan:\nDecide where to  publish\nFirst,  I will decide  if I am more  comfortable  publishing  written  content  or prefer  video  or audio  content.\nSecond,  I will decide  where  my dream  clients  are “hanging  out online”  and how they prefer  to consume\nmy content.\nMy recommendation is to publish somewhere where you don’t need someone else’s permission to\npost.\nAt first, I was going  to partner  with a local doctor’s  office  because  I knew  my dream  clients  were there,\nbut going  through  their approval  process  was delaying  the content  from going  out.\nTherefore,  since  I decided  to publish  through  video,  and since  my dream  clients  were on Facebook,  I\npicked  Facebook  as my platform.\nNote: Many people I talk to in the insurance and financial services field have compliance rules that can\nmake  it harder  to publish.  However,  get clear on how the rules work and determine  if you must get your\ncompliance group to approve your value posts so you can keep publishing. For most people with\ncompliance  rules,  there  is still a way to publish  despite  additional  policies.\n| EMILY  G ANG  90\nDecide what to  publish\nI would publish three types of content:\n1. Value posts that answer their  questions\nIn Step 1, I heard  people’s  questions.  I heard  their concerns  and what  problems  they want  me to solve.\nNow it’s time to take those  questions  and break  the answers  to them  into bite-sized  pieces.\nFor example,  people  would  come  to me and ask me to recommend  the best insurance  option  for them.\nAs a result, I broke that topic into pieces including “who can join Medicare?”, “what will it cost?” and\n“what to consider.” I eventually had a list of over fifty questions and answers that catered to people’s\ndesired final  destination.\n2. My story\nSharing  my story  is important  because  I want  the person  on the other  end watching  my videos  to get\nto know  me even though  they never  set foot into my office.\nI was amazed  that while  people  liked my value  posts  to solve  their questions,  they were more  than likely\nto become  clients  quicker  once they heard  my story.  You can follow  Russell’s  epiphany  bridge  structure\nin Expert  Secrets  to create  this content.\n3. Stories to address their objections to my service\nVery early on, I began to know some of the objections people had about joining my service. These\ncontent stories are a great way to start knocking the objections down.\nWhile it’s essential to publish based on my research in Step 1, it’s just as important to observe how\npeople react to my publishing. I started to see who was engaging with me and who wasn’t. I saw who\nwas asking questions about my information and stories.\nAs I publish more videos to Facebook, I will look to see who is engaging and what types of content get\ntheir engagement.  Then,  I will create  more  of those  content  pieces.  If there  is little to no interaction,\neither  I am missing  the key issues,  or I am reaching  the wrong  audience.\nWhen  I publish,  I will test different  call to actions  at the end of my published  pieces,  such as instructing\npeople  to email  me to schedule  a free call that covers  the steps  they must take before  finalizing  their\nMedicare  decision.  In this free call, I cover  the ten steps  they should  consider  as they approach  turning\n65. This is an example  of a service  that gets them  results  but doesn’t  necessarily  solve  their whole\nproblem.\nIf you already  have an opt-in page that’s  converting  for you, then you can keep using  that.  However,  the\nkey is to start finding  your new potential  clients  so you can nurture  them  to be buyers.\nWhen  I first started  our business  Facebook  page,  I invited  all of our clients,  friends,  and family  to follow\nand like the page. Having our existing clients on our page gave us the initial social proof that I  needed\nto get  traction.\nAdditionally,  I spent  around  $10/week  for Facebook  ads to help drive people  to my page.  Based  on this,\nI was able to test what resonated  with people  more quickly,  as well as being  able to quickly  connect  with\n| EMILY  G ANG  91\npeople outside of our personal and client network to see if the service we provide works for them too.\nStep 3: Determine the Offer\nAt this point,  I know  who I am going  to serve.  From Step 1, I know  their pain points,  desires,  and emotions.\nFrom Step 2, I have been publishing  video  content  to Facebook,  so I’m also getting  feedback  on my\nmessage.\nIn Step 3, I will start thinking  about  what  I can sell to people.  I know  my new audience  and where  they\nwant  to go from my research.  Now I must confirm  what  they want  to buy.\nThe key here is to know what to offer to people at the end of one -on-one calls.\nAction Plan:\nI will need to confirm the following:\n• What will I  offer?\n• What  is it called?\n• What  transformation  is it providing?\n• How much  will it cost?\n• What  are the specific  deliverables?\n• Will I offer free bonuses?\nI will write  my entire  offer out so that when  I talk to a potential  client,  I can easily  list what they would\nget once they signed  up.\nFor our business,  we had an offer  that was converting  with our local clients.  Therefore,  I started  to offer\nthis exact  service  to our new nationwide  clients.  This was a good starting  point  to get feedback  from\nnew people,  and in our case,  resulted  in us making  slight  changes  to our original  offer.  This is where\nStep 4 comes  in.\nStep 4: Serve Potential Clients and Test Offer\nStep 4 is an exciting  step because  conversations  with new potential  clients  begin  who likely  are outside\nof your network. This is where you get to learn more about your dream clients and how well  your\npublishing  is resonating  with them.  Additionally,  you get to test out offers  to see what  these  new clients\nwant to  buy.\nAction  Plan:\nI’ve been publishing  video  content,  and at the end of that content  have encouraged  people  to sign up\nfor a free call.\nIn my situation, people want to know exactly when to join Medicare and precisely what plan they should\nget. In this free meeting, I don’t solve their entire problem, but I give them the initial steps to get them\nstarted.\nOnce I get some traction here with the free calls, I can charge for this service. The key is to get a potential\n| EMILY  G ANG  92\npaying  client  on the phone  so that I can provide  them  value,  but more  importantly  in these  early stages,\nI want to get their feedback  on my marketing  message  and offer.  At the end of each call, I will make  an\noffer to  them.\nEvery  time I do this, I will get my marketing  and offer  even more  precise,  so I will keep doing  this until I\nget at least five paying  clients.\nIf I can’t get five paying clients, I will go back and look at the following:\n• Am I publishing  the right information  to the right person?\n• Am I publishing  to the correct  audience?\n• What  else am I missing  that is keeping  me from getting  the five clients?\nI will also make  sure to get testimonials  from people  I am already  working  with in this step and publish\nthe stories  of wins to your audience.\nPHASE 2: GET READY TO GROW FAST\nYou’ve done all the research and testing so now it comes down to a numbers game. Show the right\npeople your fantastic offer and get ready for your new clients.\nStep 5: Standardize My Offer and Bonuses\nIt’s essential  to get crystal  clear  on exactly  what  I am selling  so I can start talking  to a lot of potential\nclients.\nAction plan:\nI will look to see what people bought in Step 4.\nIn my experience,  I sold people  similar  services  in Step 4, but there  was some  customization.  I realized\nthat if I wanted  to grow fast, it was best for me to standardize  the offer.  One thing  I learned  is that our\ntraditional brick and mortar business with local clients offered one big package, and people bought   it\nbecause they already had a relationship with us. It w asn’t until I started to find clients online that  I\nhad to change  the offer slightly.  While  at the end of the day it was a very similar  service  and process,  I\nrealized  that some  of the additional  services  we did without  thinking  were valuable  free bonuses.  So, I\ndecided  to highlight  these  bonuses  to our nationwide  online  clients.\nStep 6: Build My Funnel\nNow I have all the pieces to bring in clients, so I will build the funnel to bring in 100 new ones.\nAction Plan:\nFirst, I must decide which type of funnel is best to sell my service\nI used a webinar  funnel  to build our business.  I picked  the webinar  funnel  based  on the price  of the offer\nand the process  I thought  I needed  to take a potential  client  through  to be a paying  client.\nI would create a webinar landing page in ClickFunnels using a webinar template. I wouldn’t start from\n| EMILY  G ANG  93\nscratch  and would  find other  landing  pages  to a similar  demographic  to get an idea of what  converts\nbest considering  my potential  clients.\nI would  connect  all the back-end emails  so people  could  join my webinar  and increase  the chance  of\nthem  showing  up. I would  host my webinar  on Zoom,  but there  are a few different  options  out there.\nOn the webinar  registration  confirmation  page,  I include  a filmed  video  of myself  explaining  who I\nam and also ask people  to send me their number  one Medicare  question.  Doing  so will be extremely\nvaluable  because  I can get more  research  on their pain points,  and it is also a way for me to add a\ncustomized  touch  to my funnel  to make  prospective  clients  feel heard.\nNext,  I must create  my sales page for my offer and a “thank  you for purchasing”  page.\nAfter  that,  my funnel  is complete.\nI could  spend  months  creating  these  pages,  but if I want to get 100 clients  quickly,  I don’t  have time to\nwaste  on this step. I will use the ClickFunnels -provided  templates  to get a page that is good enough,\nbut I will customize  the transformation,  the deliverables,  and other  client -specific  items.\nI can get these pages done in 1 to 3 days if I leverage my past research from Steps 1 through 4.\nStep 7: Write My Webinar\nIt’s time to put into place  Russell’s“Perfect  Webinar”  script.  His“Perfect  Webinar”  framework  catapulted\nmy business.  It’s worked  for thousands  of people,  so I don’t  want to skip this step.\nI primarily  use this script  with my webinars,  but I also use the structure  from my script  when  I’m talking\nto potential  clients  one-on-one. This is just another  reason  why it’s critical  that you don’t  skip this step\nas it can be used in many  different  situations.\nAction Plan:\nI’ll read Russell’s  DotComSecrets  book again,  and build  my webinar  script  step-by-step based  on the\nguidance  provided.\nThe research I did in the early steps  is critical  to writing  my webinar  because  I should  already  have my\n“big domino”,  transformation,  offer,  objections  and corresponding  secrets  ready  to use.\nI want  to have a completed  script  ready  for my first webinar,  but at a minimum  I will have a script  for\nthe sales  portion.\nAfter  I do my first webinar,  I’ll get the recording  transcribed  and then build  on it. Having  a standardized\nscript  has been the only way I continue  to have a consistently  high-converting  webinar.  Scripts  can be\nhard to put together  at first,  but it’s worth  millions  once you have the right framework  and script.\nAdditionally,  I always  have an end-of-webinar  bonus  that people  get when  they join my program  by the\nend of the webinar.  This is one of the things  that Russell  told me to do, and I honestly  didn’t  believe  it\nwould  work.  Of course,  the first time I offered  the webinar  bonus,  I nearly  doubled  my conversions.  Be\nsure to test it out, and make  sure your end of webinar  bonus  is irresistible.\n| EMILY  G ANG  94\nStep 8: Get People to Join My Webinar\nAs I write  my webinar  script,  I should  also be recruiting  people  to join my webinar.  This step is a numbers\ngame.  I need to get people  to show  up to the webinar  so I can pitch  them  my irresistible  offer.\nAction Plan:\nThere  are a few ways to get people  to join my webinar,  but I found  the quickest  way to do it was through\nFacebook  ads.\nFor our business, I knew my clients were on Facebook, so this was a good place for me to find more\nclients. I had a list of emails from 500+ of our then -current clients, so I uploaded those into Facebook\nand created  a “look  alike”  audience  based  on those  people.  I used this audience  to create  targeted  ads\ninviting  people  to my webinar.\nI will use Facebook  ads to send people  to my ClickFunnels  webinar  registration  page,  and once they’ve\nregistered,  a corresponding follow -up email sequence will be sent out to increase the show -up rate to\nthe webinar.\nStep 9: Host My Webinar\nIt’s finally the day to start bringing in many more clients with my webinar presentation. I’m going to\nhave fun with this because it’s the gateway to my 100 new clients.\nAction Plan:\nI will execute the webinar exactly how it’s expla ined in Russell’s book, DotComSecrets .\nThough  you will have to determine  what time works  best for your ideal clients,  I will do my webinars  on\nMondays  at 6pm and Fridays  at 12pm.\nAfter the webinar is over, I will have a deadline by which people can sign up, and I will send an email\nfollow -up the sequence which includes the webinar replay to get even more buyers.\nIn this follow  up sequence,  if people  don’t  buy, I will send them  an email  asking  them  why. Based  on this\nfeedback,  I will tweak  my webinar  script,  offer,  or anything  else necessary.  Then,  I’ll execute  my webinar\nagain.\nMy first few webinars  didn’t  convert  very well,  but I continued  to do my webinar  twice  a week.  I would\nmake  small  changes  primary  to the wording  around  the offer  until I got my first 100 clients.\nStep 10: Serve 100 Clients\nNow I get to serve  my clients.  As I do, I’ll make  sure to get testimonials  and reviews  whenever  possible.\nIf testimonials  aren’t  possible  because  of compliance  rules,  I’ll see where  I can do case studies  which\ncan be equally  as powerful  for future  sales and marketing.\nRemember, you’ve worked hard to get to this point, so be sure to celebrate and enjoy your succes s!\n| BR ICK & MOR TAR FU N N E L  S 95\nJaime Cross\nCEO & Founder of\nMIG Soap & The HER Effect\nTwo years  after leaving  her corporate  banking  career  to be home  with\nher newborn  son, Jaime  Cross  had a longing  to build a meaningful  empire\ndriven  by purpose  and worldwide  impact.

Craving the balance between\nmom life and a successful  medical  field career,  she opened  a\nmedical  aesthetics  spa. After numerous  requests  from other\nmedical  moms,  she founded  her own training  program  that\nteaches  other  medical  professionals  how to build the business\nand life they deserve.\nPainlessCE.com\n| J E N N I F E R  SE W EL L  102\nGenerate Tons of Clients With No\nReferrals,  No List, And A BIG Competitor\nI handed  over my credit  card to the receptionist.  “Today’s charges  will be $3,600.”  I smiled  politely  and\ntried to disguise my surprise. The reality hit me. I was paying almost a week’s salary for one hour’s\nworth  of services  at a medical  spa. As I walked  to my car, I wondered  why didn’t  I open a medical  spa?\nI had the same (actually more) education and credentials than the registered nurse who just provided\nmy services.\nI started  the research  process.  I looked  for the medical  spa services  that had the highest  profit  margin.\nI bought  the equipment:  a permanent  fat-removing  device  and a skin-tightening  machine.  I was now\ncommitted  to more  debt than my first home  mortgage.  I was told not to worry  by the device  salesmen.\nThey assured  me that their companies  spent  millions  of dollars  advertising  every  year and customers\nwould  be looking  for me. I was ready  for the phone  to start ringing  and to start making  some  money.\nWell,  the phones  started  ringing  - only about  once every  two weeks.\nTo complicate  the matter,  a local day spa decided  they were going  to expand  their services  to include\nmedical  spa services.  They bought  the same  equipment  as me. I now had a direct  competitor  in the\nsame  small  town.  The difference  was they had a large  existing  client  base,  and I had none.  I was starting\nfrom nothing:  no list, no patients,  no referrals.\nThe reality set in again. I now owned a business, was in hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt  from\nequipment purchases, and I was responsible for providing someone else’s salary (my receptionis t). I\nhad no business,  marketing  or sales training.  What  had I done?\nIf you are in this situation  or maybe  you want  to open a medical  spa, I am going  to lay out the steps\nthat I followed  which  made  my business  very profitable.  You can shortcut  your path to success  and not\nmake  some  of the mistakes  I made.\nLet’s get started.\nI CAME FIRST\nStep 1: I had to develop myself first\nFirst,  I had to work on myself,  not my business.  This may sound  a little  strange,  but it is true.  One of my\nmentors  tells his clients,  “a business  can only grow as fast as the owner  does.”  This is some  of the best\nbusiness  advice  I have received.  You absolutely  must prepare  your own mindset  and develop  yourself\nbefore  you can successfully  lead others  and have a successful  business.\nI needed  to decide  who I was. If you are like me and you are in the medical  field as a nurse,  doctor  or\ndentist, you have spent many years in obtaining your education. We learn about disease  processes\nand how to take care of other  people.  In all my years  of formal  education,  I did not have one class that\ntaught  me to further  develop  myself  and my mindset.  If you have not started  personal  development  or\nmindset  training,  start today!  Who are you? Are you intelligent,  kind,  compassionate?  Maybe  you are a\n| J E N N I F E R  SE W EL L  103\nrebel?  Whatever  you are, own it, and tell yourself  everyday.  Every  morning  look in the mirror,  and affirm\nthat you are this person.\nI needed  to plan for success.  I cannot  stress  the importance  of a daily morning  routine  enough.  When\nI was a staff nurse  and working  in the operating  room  as a nurse  anesthetist,  most of my days were\nlived in default  mode.  What  I mean  by this is, every  morning  the alarm  would  go off. I would  hit the\nsnooze  button,  and then at the last minute  I would  leap out of bed, shower  and get dressed  as quickly\nas possible.  The next hour was a scramble,  getting  my son up and off to school  and barely  arriving  to\nwork on time.  As you can imagine  the rest of my morning  seemed  a little  chaotic  and disorganized.\nThis may work while  you are an employee  and providing  services  that people  have to have,  but when\nyou are running  a business  and selling  luxury  services,  you have to show  up as your best self. You can\nimplement  a morning  routine  just by waking  up an extra  15 minutes  early.  If you don’t  already  have\none, start simple.  Wake  up, do some  mediation  or deep breathing,  hydrate  yourself,  give gratitude  for\nthree  things  and visualize  your day. Once  you see how effective  a morning  routine  is, you may want  to\nincrease  the time.  The point  is, you want  to prepare  yourself  and get your mind in the right state  before\nyou have encounters  with your staff or clients.\nBUSINESS TIME\nStep 2: I had to identify my best client\nNext I needed  to work on my business.  I thought  about  who would  be my best client.  Nowadays,  med\nspa clientele  is quite  diverse,  but to get things  going,  I thought  about  my target  avatar.  When  I opened\nmy spa, I imagined  my best customer  would  be a woman  in her thirties  who wanted  to lose her mom\nbelly.  As it turns  out, my biggest  customer  demographic  was a woman  in her early  to mid-fifties  who\nno longer  had children  at home.  She made  enough  money  to pay for services  without  feeling  like she\nneeded  to talk to her spouse  about  the services  and just wanted  to “do something  for herself.”\nWhen  you are thinking  about  your target  avatar,  you want  to get as close  to them  as possible.  Imagine\nhim or her. What  is their name?  Are they married  or single?  What  do they think  about  when  they wake\nup in the morning?  What  are their fears and insecurities?  What  keeps  them  up at night?  How can your\nservices  help solve  their problems?  This will all be very useful  when  you start to create  your content.\nStep 3: I began creating content\nEven with med spa services  being  a high-ticket  luxury  service,  I am still selling  a commodity.  No matter\nif you are offering  neuromodulators  (Botox)  and hyaluronic  acid (dermal  filler)  injections  or permanent\nfat loss, it is likely  you have a competitor  within  driving  distance  who offers  the same  services  - and I\ndefinitely  did! I needed  to set myself  apart  from my competition  and position  myself  as the expert.  I\nwanted  anyone  who needed  my services  to immediately  think  of me.\nMy favorite form of content is live video on social platforms. Video has many advantages, but one\nreason  I love it is that I feel like it allows  your potential  clients  to get to know,  like, and trust you before\nyou ever meet them for consultation. For whatever service you want to promote, I highly recommend\nmaking a live video of a client receiving the treatment. (Make su re your client signs the appropriate\nmedia  consents).\nFor my live video,  I asked  a local tennis  instructor  who was my perfect  avatar.  She was in her early\nfifties,  had an outgoing  personality  and knew  a lot of women  who might  be potential  clients.  During\n| J E N N I F E R  SE W EL L  104\nthis video,  I talked  about  the treatment  and answered  the most frequently  asked  questions  I normally\nanswered  during  client  consultations.  I also applied  the strategies  Russell  Brunson  describes  in Expert\nSecrets  chapters  one and nine.\nBy the way, if you haven’t read Expert Secrets , read it as soon as you finish this book! In chapter one,\nRussell  references  The One Sentence  Persuasion  Course  by Blair Warren.  The first step is to “encourage\ntheir dreams”. So, if you are selling body contouring, in your video you want to show how your service\nis going  to give them  the body they desire.\nNext is “justify  their failures”.  In my video,  I talked  about  how my client,  Kathy,  was a tennis  instructor\nwho plays  tennis  everyday  and has a consistent  workout  routine  but still could  not lose her stubborn\nbelly fat or love handles.  If you are providing  services  for permanent  fat loss removal,  it is likely  your\nclient  has attempted  many  diets and exercise  programs  but still do not have the results  they desire.\nThis is our opportunity  to justify  their failures.  They are not responsible  for the inability  to lose stubborn\nfat; often  age, hormones  or genetics  make  it difficult.  If Kathy  is a very active  tennis  instructor  and can’t\nlose her stubborn  fat, she definitely  should  not feel ashamed  of their weight  loss failures.\nNext, I “allayed their fears”. I showcased how the procedure has worked for so many other clients who\nwere just like them or Kathy who was rec eiving the treatment. I allayed their fears about pain or\ndiscomfort. During my video, I had Kathy talk about how she resumed her normal workout routine\nimmediately  after her first treatment.\nNext,  you must “confirm  their suspicions”.  I asked  Kathy  to talk about  her skepticism  of the procedure,\nbut how, in reality,  it worked  out well for her.\nFinally,  I “threw  rocks  at my enemies”.  There  could  be a lot of enemies  in this situation,  such as prior\ndiets that didn’t  work,  other  treatments  potential  clients  have tried that didn’t  work or even a personal\ntrainer  who told them  that a fat loss procedure  was “cheating.”  In chapter  nine of Expert  Secrets , Russell\ntalks about  breaking  false belief  patterns.  Before  you make  your video,  think  of all the false beliefs  your\npotential  clients  may have.  You want  to start breaking  the false beliefs  in your treatment  video.\nIf you have never  recorded  a live video,  you may initially  be nervous  or hesitant.  Everyone  who has ever\nmade a video was likely nervous the first time. After the first one, it gets easier, and every time the\nvideos get  better.\nTwo things to remember:\n1. Be yourself. Remember when we talked about who you are? Be that person. Be real, and be\nauthentic.  If you are naturally  a funny  person,  be funny  in the video.  People  can sense  if you are\nfake, and no one wants  to do business  with someone  fake.\n2. It does not have to be perfect.  Again,  be real. If you make  a mistake  or mispronounce  a word,\njust keep going.  Many  people  are put off by perfection.  Be candid,  just like you were in a realtime\nconsultation answering  questions.\nI used this video  for my ads on social  media.  Like everyone,  I did encounter  some  “Negative  Nellies”\nwho made  comments  that my services  don’t  work or are too expensive,  etc. These  comments  are an\nopportunity  to further  educate  potential  clients.  I never  argue  or belittle  a person  who makes  a negative\ncomment  on my paid ads. I acknowledge  their response  and use it as an opportunity  for turnaround.\nAn example  might  be Negative  Nelly  comments  that “this procedure  doesn’t  work.”  A good response\nwould  be, “Nelly,  thank  you for taking  the time to comment  on our page.  We would  love to invite  you in\nfor a complimentary  consultation  and show  you before  and after  pictures  of our many  happy  clients.”\n| J E N N I F E R  SE W EL L  105\nNegative  Nelly  is probably  not an ideal client,  but her comment  was an opportunity  to display  a gracious\nmanner  and show  social  proof  of other  satisfied  clients.\nStep 4: I needed a funnel!\nFunnel time! Now that I was getting some traffic from my video ads, I chose to send them to an\napplication  funnel.  Can you imagine  having  the ability  to have a consult  with your client  or patient\nbefore  they ever come  into the office?  The application  funnel  with video  does just that.  It is perfect  for\nmed spa services  or any medical  service.  It gives  you the opportunity  to show  your expertise,  address\nthe most common  questions  that you answer  in consultation  and let the potential  client  know  if they\nare a good candidate  for the procedure.  This was (and still is) the start of my sales process.  I cannot  tell\nyou how many  times  I have heard  clients  say, “Well,  in the video  I watched  you already  answered  most\nof the questions  I had. Now I think  I am ready  to do this.”\nAfter  the potential  client  sees my awesome  live video  on social  media,  they will have the option  to click\non the “learn  more”  button.  This will take them  to my application  funnel.  Here I will have the opportunity\nto ask the potential  client  or patient  about  their health  history,  weight  loss goals  and determine  if they\nare a candidate  for my service.\nAfter  they input  their information,  they will be directed  to the next step of the funnel.  Here they will find\nout if they are a candidate  for your services.  If they are, great!  The funnel  takes  them  to the next step\nwhich  will tell them  more  about  your service.  If they are not a candidate,  they will be told so but asked\nto “please  remember  us in the future  if things  should  change!”\nThe patient  who is a potential  candidate  will keep going  through  the funnel.  They will learn  all about  the\nprocedure,  and through  watching  my videos,  they will have already  gotten  to know,  like and trust me!\nNow anyone  who has invested  this much  time learning  about  my service  must be serious.  They will\nnow have an opportunity  to put in their contact  information  for an appointment  request.  This is great;\nI now have the potential  client’s  email  and phone  number.\nNow that my client  has come  through  my funnel,  I want to get them  on the phone.  I use a texting  service\nand immediately send a text as soon as the application comes through. I word the text to something\nlike, “I just received  your request  for an appointment.  Do you have just a minute  so I can call you to set\nthat up?” When  you get the potential  client  on the phone,  this is a continuation  of the sales process  and\nthe opportunity  to set an appointment.\nWhen  the client  arrives  for the consultation,  this is the final step in the sales process.  Remember,  I\nwant  to position  myself  as the expert,  answer  any final questions  and close  the sale. I do not hard close\nanyone  for med spa services.  There  are other  places  and even med spa “consultants”  who use high-\npressure  tactics.  I want  to build  a relationship  and have a lifelong  customer,  not talk someone  into a\nservice  and who later has buyer’s  remorse.\nStep 5: I needed to retarget potential clients\nNow, imagine that the client put in an application through your funnel, but you could never get them\non the phone. You have someone who is interested in the service, but they just need a little more social\nproof.  Let’s give them  some in the same place  they first found  you. We can do this with retargeting  videos.\nI use real patient  testimonials  for my retargeting  videos.  I start with a headline  that says, “Do you think\nXYZ is too good to be true?  Listen  to what  our patient  Kathy  has to say.” Then  I use a testimonial  video\n| J E N N I F E R  SE W EL L  106\nwhere  my client  is discussing  her results:  she is back in her size small  tennis  skirts  that she has not\nworn in  years.\nMaybe  the client  just needs  to get to know,  like and trust me more.  I will dominate  the conversation  on\ntheir social media news feed. Since I want to stand out as an expert in my field, I want to produce as\nmuch  content  as possible  that is related  to my services.  I’ll think  of all the things  that my client  might\nbe interested in and make videos about that content. If I am selling body contouring, likely my client\nhas tried a lot of diets or is at least curious  about  them.  I will make  a video  about  my experience  with\nthe keto diet, or a video about what recen t research says about plant -based diets. Maybe if summer is\ncoming up, I will do a video about top -rated beaches and end the video with a call to action about my\n“body contouring special” so viewers can get beach -ready for summer. Whatever the majority of my\nclients are interested in is what I should make videos about, using social media to get my content in\nfront of them. For my clients that are more logical decision makers, they need more time to get to\nknow me and research my service. By being consistent in my content production, they will end up in\nmy funnel  and in my office  for a consultation.\nConclusion\nWhat  I have just described  in these  last few pages  took me many  months  to figure  out. If I had to start\nover, I would  build  a funnel  and run ads for paid traffic  before  I even opened  my doors.  I would  have\nappointments  scheduled  before  my business  even opened.  No matter  where  you are in your journey,\nconsidering  a career  change  or adding  a med spa to your existing  services,  this proven  method  will\nhelp shortcut  your path to success.  The strategies  I have described  helped  me to build  a med spa in a\nsmall  town  in the middle  of nowhere  that did higher  volumes  than medical  spas in metropolitan  areas\nwith a large  clientele  base.  I had one woman  drive  four hours  one way to get the same  services  from me\n(a nurse)  that were offered  by a plastic  surgeon  in her hometown.  One of her friends  shared  my video\non Facebook  and she saw it, ended  up in my funnel  and became  a loyal customer.  Bottom  line: funnels\nand social  media  work for any business!\n| BR ICK & MOR TAR FU N N E L  S 107\nJoe McCall\nFounder  of Chamberlain  Holdings,  LLC\n& Realtor  with Keller  Williams\nJoe has been investing  in real estate  for over 11 years\nin many  different  markets  around  the country.

If you’re  reading  this as an investor,  and you are\nnot a licensed  realtor,  I strongly  recommend  that you get your license.  If you are reading  this as a realtor\nwho only does traditional  listings,  I highly  recommend  you start thinking  about  working  with investors.\nWhatever  role you do have,  you will still find the principles  I talk about  in this chapter  helpful.)\nThis is exactly what I would do.\nTarget Buyers First\nSo many people who are in the business of real estate go after the seller, the one who has a house   to\nsell. I’m here to tell you that if you want to make the most money, in the easiest and fastest way\npossible,  focus  on finding  buyers.\nWhy?  It’s simple.  Buyers  are the primary  customers  in our business.  They are the ones who have the\nmoney  and bring  it to the table.\nDo you know the “golden rule”? The one with the gold makes the rules.\nThe easiest  way to make  money  in real estate  is to find the buyers  first. I would  find what they want,  and\nthen go get it for them.  Simple  as that.\nWhile  every  realtor  and investor  out there  are fighting  over the same  small  pool of sellers,  the smart\nones are focusing  all of their marketing  efforts  on finding  the buyers  first.  In business,  it is always  easier\nto sell people  what  they want,  then try to sell them  what  you have.\n“Finding buyers first” as a strategy works in any market, but it works especially well in this current\nmarket, as prices are finally starting to slow down. We are coming into more of a buyer’s market.\nSo I will focus  on being  a local expert  and finding  the buyers  first.  This is the fastest  way to make  money\nin real estate.\nWhat Kind Of Buyers Do I Want?\nWhat kind of buyer should I focus on, though? Retail buyers (owner occupants) or investor buyers\n(landlords / rehabbers)?\n| JO E MC C ALL 109\nI recommend and would focus on the investor buyers first. Why? There are many reasons:\n• They have access  to lots of cash.\n• They usually  buy multiple  properties.\n• They are not as picky  as retail  buyers.\n• They are more  educated  than retail  buyers.\n• You don’t  have to drive  them  all over town,  looking  at a ton of properties.\n• And most importantly, they are easy to find! They’re everywhere. They’re in public records.\nThey attend  local Meetups.  They are online  searching  for investment  properties.  They buy real\nestate  education.\nIf I did want to only focus  on the retail  buyers,  I would  need to be super  specific  about  what kind of retail\nbuyer I want to target. Would I focus on the first -time home buyer, the upgrade buyer, the downgrade\nbuyer,  the relocation  buyer,  the distressed  buyer?\nI would  need to pick one and go with it. I would  need to be hyper -focused  on who my buyer  is and go\nafter  them  with 100% of everything  I’ve got.\nOne Market & One Marketing Strategy\nThis is absolutely  imperative.  I must only focus  on one market.  I need to be the local expert.  I can’t  do\nthis in multiple  markets.  I have to be the “category  king”  in my own “blue  ocean.”\nThe riches are in the niches, so I shouldn’t be afraid to go an inch wide and a mile deep. I want to be\nknown as the realtor who helps these specific buyers, buy these specific properties, in these specific\nareas, with my specific resources that only I hav e.\nI also need to be hyper -focused  on one marketing  strategy.  I can’t  do 100 different  things  and do them\nall well.  I need to pick one good way to find buyers,  and do that 100% every  day. Only when  I’m done\nwith that,  then maybe  you can also do something  else.\nWrite Down My ONE Things\nNow I will write  it down:  what  is my ONE buyer?  What  is the ONE market  that they are in? What  is the\nONE type of property  they are looking  for? And what  is the ONE way I am going  to focus  on finding\nthese  buyers?\nI’m Not Unique\nOf course every market is unique. Every market is local, but these rules for finding buyer leads for my\nreal estate business are the same all over the country. All over the world for that matter.\nI can’t allow myself to think “these things won’t work for me because ‘I’m special’, ‘I’m unique’, ‘my\nmarket  is different’,  ‘the people  in my market  are different’,  ‘my market  is too competitive’,  ‘my market\nis too big or too small.’”\n| JO E MC C ALL 110\nI will stop giving myself excuses for why I think this will not work for me in my market. I will trust the\nprocess,  get out there  and make  it happen.  I won’t  let anyone  tell me I can’t  do this, or that it won’t  work\nfor me.\nCome Up With A Plan & Execu te It (Violently!)\nGeorge  S. Patton  was famous  for saying,  “A good plan violently  executed  now is better  than a perfect\nplan executed  next week.”\nMy first step is to come up with a plan, but I will forget about it being a perfect plan. It will never be\nperfect. I believe that “done is the new perfect.”\nSo I will stop making excuses, write down my own plan, and VIOLENTLY execute it!\nI can always  modify  it later.  This isn’t a plan that I’m going  to be committing  to for the rest of my life.\nEventually,  I will hire other  people  to implement  it for me, but for now, I’ll write  down  my plan & execute\nit IMMEDIATELY,  today.\nI will write  down  what my #1 goal in this real estate  business  is. There’s  nothing  wrong  if that goal is “to\nmake  money.”  I can start from there.\nBut how do I get there?  How do I make  money  in real estate?  I need to start from the ‘money’  and work\nbackwards.  This marketing  plan is all about  things  I can control.\nI can’t control how much money I will make per month. I can’t control what my average profit  or\ncommissions  are on each deal.  I can’t  control  the average  number  of sellers  or buyers  I need to talk to\nbefore  I do a deal.\nBut I can control  my daily lead generation  activities  and my daily prospecting.  My plan simply  needs\nto show  what  I am going  to do every  day to get people  to download  my lead magnet  and get the phone\nto ring.\nI would  submit  that my only goal should  be to talk to 10 buyers  a day. That’s  it. Nothing  else really\nmatters.  If I talk to 10 clients  a day, I am going  to do deals.  Everything  I’m working  on should  be to fulfill\nthat goal.\nMy plan should  only have 1 to 2 things  I should  be doing  every  day that will allow  me to talk to 10 buyers\na day. I will eliminate  everything  else. I won’t  call it a day or quit until I VIOLENTLY  execute  my plan.\nWhat  does it take to talk to 10 potential  buyers  / clients  a day? I will talk about  all that and lay out some\ngood ideas,  but I need to make  sure I keep it super  simple.\nFIRST – Build Out Simple Lead Funnels In ClickFunnels\nI need to know  what  my buyers  want  and what  they are looking  for. I need to enter  into the conversation\nthat they are having  in their heads  right now. What  do they want?\nHere are some things I should be thinking about, things that maybe my buyers want:\n• Good  profitable  deals  at great  bargains\n• Speed and  convenience\n| JO E MC C ALL 111\n• Increased  cash flow,  decreased  overwhelm\n• A way to save money\n• A property  that doesn’t  need a lot of work\n• A property  that DOES  need a lot of work (Note:  you need to figure  out what  it is that your buyers\nwant.)\n• Not looking at 1,000 different properties. They want someone to do some of the legwork /\nresearch for them.\n• A “boots  on the ground”  person  that is going  to look out for their interests.\n• Connections  & resources  – “your  rolodex.”\n• First dibs on all your best properties.\n• Someone  who will patiently  take the time to explain  everything  to them  in simple  terms.\n• (There’s  a lot more  that buyers  want…  Write  them  down.)\nCould  I take anything  from that list and turn them  into some  potential  front -end lead magnets?  Oh\nyes… easy peasy.\nThe important thing is to ask. I need to ask my buyers what they want and how I can best help them. I\nwill give that to them.\nWhen  I know  what they want,  I will create  some  free reports,  checklists,  tools,  or resources:  something\nthat is really  valuable  and solves  some  of their biggest  needs.\nHere are some  potential  ideas:  (Note,  you don’t  have to pick just one. Maybe  you can have one be your\nmain thing,  and then have a couple  more  as a free bonus.)\n• Free Report:  How to buy your next investment  property  in <City>  and save $1,000’s\n• Free Report:  Where  the best rental  properties  are in <City>  that will give you the highest  profits,\nthe best tenants,  the least hassles…  and how to find them.\n• Free Report:  How to buy your next <City>  rental  or rehab  with ZERO  money  down…  without\nusing  any of your own money  and credit.\n• Free Report:  The Top 10 Biggest  Mistakes  Investors  Make  In <City>  and How To Avoid  Them.\n• Controversial  Report:  The Top 5 Worst  <City>  Zip Codes  To Buy Investment  Properties  In\n• Free Calculator  Shows  You How Much  Cash Flow You Will Make  (Or Lose)  On Your Next <City>\nInvestment  Property\n• Discover  The Top Zip Codes  With The Most Evictions  In <City>\n• Discover  The Top Zip Codes  Of <City>  That Give Investors  The Highest  ROI (And The Zips That\nWill Give You The Worst)\n• Free Rehab  Estimator  That Will Tell You What  Your Rehabs  Will Cost – So You Don’t  Make  Stupid\nOffers in  <City>\n• TOP SECRET: Spy On Your Competition...Find Out What Your Competition Is Doing Today….\nFree Spreadsheet  Reveals  Exactly  What  Investors  Are Buying  In <City>,  and For How Much.\n| JO E MC C ALL 112\nAfter They Download The Lead Magnet\nNow that they’ve  put in their email  for their free lead magnet,  what should  I do?\nIt’s simple;  I will ask for their phone  number  and give them  mine.\nI might  give them  another  ethical  bribe  in exchange  for getting  on the phone  and talking  with them.  I\nwill tell them  to call me or text me if they want  my own personal  recommendations  and advice  for the\nlocal market.\nYes, you read that correctly. I will actually give them my cell phone number. The number one  problem\nthat most realtors  & investors  have is they are not accessible.  They are hard to get a hold of. They don’t\nreturn  calls.  They don’t  answer  their phone.  I want to make  a lot of money  in real estate  in the next 6\nto 12 months. I want to be a “top producer” and stand out above all my competition. So I’m going to\nanswer  my phone.  Talk to people.  Flap my lips!\n(That is, unless I hate money. Then I’ll let all my calls go to voicemail.)\nIt’s amazing to me how many times clients have said to me, “Wow, you’re the only one that answers\ntheir phone. You’re the only one who calls me back. Thank you! Let’s do some business today.”\nWhat  are some  things  I can bribe  them  with to get their phone  number  on the next page,  after  they\ndownload  their lead magnet?  Here are some  ideas:\n• “Thanks  for downloading  XYZ. If you would  like me to text you a list of my favorite  people\nthat can help you do ABC, text or call me at 555-CELL-PHONE,  or put your number  here\nso I can text it to you.”\n• “If you would  like to be the first to be notified  when  I find smoking  hot deals  in <City>,  give\nme your phone  number  here.”\n• “If you would  like a list of my personal  favorite…\nº mortgage  brokers  that work with my clients  in <City>\nº local banks  that have low down  payment  plans  & easy qualifying  credit\nprograms  - specifically  for investors\nº  pre-vetted  property  managers  that can take care of all your properties  for you º\nlocal tenant  screening  companies  that will help you avoid  the problem  tenants º\nmost reliable  handy -men,  contractors,  cleaning  companies,  service  contractors,\nproperty inspectors that are willing and ready to work for you and save you tons of money…\nº local down  payment  assistance  programs\nº a list of local private  lenders  that can lend you private  money  on your next deal\nº local tax incentive  programs  / special  affordable  housing  programs\nHow will I know  what works  and what doesn’t?  I’ll test, test, test. I’ll think  about  who my buyer  is and\nwhat they want.  I won’t  fish for sharks  with little minnow  bait. I’ll use shark  bait.\n| JO E MC C ALL 113\nWhen I do talk to them, I’ll ask them what they want. I’ll ask them how I can help them make more money.\nHow to Find Buyers: The Actual Campaigns\nThis is the most important section of this chapter. It doesn’t matter if I have the best funnel, lead\nmagnet s or follow -up if no one sees my stuff.\nThe key to all these  strategies  below  is consistency.  I have to be consistent  in this. This has to be what\nI’m doing  every  day without  fail.\nI need a scorecard  to track  these  numbers.  I need a coach  to hold me accountable  to my scorecard.\nIn fact, I should  probably  get a friend  who has permission  to kick my butt if I don’t  meet  these  targets!\nI must remember  to track  things  I can control.  This is what  is on my scorecard:  daily activities.  These\ndaily activities  are tied to my SMART  goals  (Specific,  Measurable,  Attainable,  Relevant,  Timely).\nFOUR WAYS TO FIND BUYERS\n1. Call Existing  Landlords  3.  Participate in Local Investor  Groups\n2. Produce Daily  Marketing  Content  4. Follow Up, Follow Up, Follow  Up\n1: Call Existing Landlords\nThis is simple. I will find the people that are already buying properties in my target market, contact\nthem,  and ask them  if they want to buy more.  (I’ll also ask them  if they have anything  they want to sell.)\nHow do I find their numbers?  Zillow  and Craigslist  are my two favorite  ways.  I can also message  people\nin Facebook  Marketplace  who have rental  properties.  Through  GoSection8.com  I can also find more\nphone  numbers.\nHere is another of my favorite ways. I will download a list of investors who have recently purchased\ninvestment  properties  in the area and send simple  handwritten  yellow  letters  to 10-20 of them.  I’ll send\n10-20 letters  every  day, just asking  them  if they are looking  for any more  properties  in the area.  I’ll hand\naddress  the envelope  and put a real stamp  on it, too.)\nThis is what my letters say:\nHi Investor LLC,\nI see you just purchased  a property  on 123 Main St in <City>.\nAre you looking  for more  investment  properties  in the area?\nGive me a call, or text me at 555 -555-5555. I think I can help you.\nP.S. - You can also visit my website here to download this free resource. I think you might like it.\nI want to make these letters look personal, not professional. I’ll handwrite everything on yellow legal\npads of paper and use an invitation -style envelope with a real stamp. I’ll adhere the stamp a little\ncrooked and even add a $0.01 stamp to make my lette r stand out even more.\n| JO E MC C ALL 114\n(Do you want another secret, awesome tip? Crumple up the letters, and refold them. It adds some\nthickness  to the envelope,  increases  the curiosity  of the recipient,  and causes  them  to even more  quickly\nread what the letter  says. This alone  will probably  double  your response  rate!)\nWhat  if I did a quick  Google  search  of these  investors,  found  their phone  numbers,  then just cold called\nthem?  Usually,  the managing  members  of an LLC can be found  by looking  on my State’s  Secretary  of\nState  website.  With a little  sleuthing  on the internet,  I can find their phone  numbers  and call them!\nI will just make  it a goal to do something  simple  and small  every  day, whether  that’s  sending  10 letters\nor cold calling  10 investors.  I’ll do it every  day.\nWhen I’m talking to these active investors, I will always ask them two questions:\n• Are you looking  to buy any other  properties?\n• Do you have any properties  you would  like to sell?\n2: Produce Regular Content - YouTube Videos and Podcasts\nThis is so powerful, especially when I can hyper -focus my content marketing to my local market.\nGoogle,  YouTube  and Facebook  all love local and regional  content  marketing.  This is the type of content\nthat is most likely  to be relevant  to their customers.  They will gladly  show  my stuff to their customers\nas long as it’s useful  and relevant.\nI will focus  on doing  a simple  5-10 minute  YouTube  video  every  day, and I will also record  a local investing\npodcast  at least 3 times  a week.\nMy channel, videos, podcasts will all be specific to my local region. I’ll use my city keywords in everything.\nIn the beginning,  I will expect  to have a smaller  audience,  but that is ok. My goal is to be a big fish in a\nsmall  pond.  My local market  is a huge blue ocean!\nIn all my content,  I want to talk about  my local market,  the things  that make  me stand  out as the local\ninvestment expert. Trust me, no one is really doing this consistently. It’s easy to stand out in a local\nmarket.\nWhen  I create  content,  I know  I’m not only talking  to buyers  who live in my local market  either.  I will also\nbe talking to out -of-state investors that will be searching the internet for information about my local\nmarket.  They will find me if I have been consistent.\nFinally, I’ll make sure that all my content has a simple call -to-action (CTA) at the beginning and end.\nWhat Am I Going To Talk About?\nThis again  is super  easy. It just takes  a little planning.  One of my favorite  content  ideas  is to interview\nlocal people  in the real estate  business.  After  I interview  these  people,  I will ask if there’s  a way that I\ncan share  their interview  with their audience.  Here are some  people  you could  interview:\n• Property  Managers\n• Realtors and  Brokers\n| JO E MC C ALL 115\n• Title Companies\n• Mortgage  brokers  who work with investors\n• Local  banks  who lend to local investors\n• Insurance  agents\n• Local  contractors\n• Local  inspectors\n• Local real estate  attorneys\n• Other  landlords  who own rental  properties\n• Local  home  builders  & developers\n• Local  real estate  club leaders\n• Local  city officials  & housing  experts\nWhere  else can I go to get fresh  content  and ideas  for my videos  and podcasts?  Here are some  steps  I\nwould  take:\n• Read local newspapers.  Talk about  what’s  happening  locally  in real estate  and general\nbusiness.\nº Search  Google  News  for “<City>  real estate.”\nº Find local  blogs.\n• See what  other  real estate  investors  are talking  about  on YouTube.\nº Look at the comments  below  the videos.\nº What  are their headlines?  Suggested  videos?\n• Check out BiggerPockets.com and various local Facebook Groups. What are people\ntalking  about  there?  What  are the hot topics?  What  questions  are people  asking?\nº Look at the comment  threads  of blog posts  and articles.  What  are the most common\nquestions?\n• Look at the popular  real estate  books  in Amazon,  and look at their ‘Table  of Contents’  sections.\n• Have a “Deal Of The Day” segment, where I video walk -through a vacant investment\nproperty. (Make sure you get the local listing agent’s permission before you video one  of\ntheir houses  and promote  it. Most won’t  mind,  but you need to ask first.)\nº Talk about  the area,  the neighbors,  the schools,  the local businesses.\nº Talk about  the pros and cons.\nº Talk about  the numbers.  What  are the rents  in the area?  What  are the average  values?\n• Be careful with giving numbers & estimates. Be general, and use ranges. Always under -\npromise  and over-deliver.  Make  lots of disclaimers.\n• Talk about  the contacts  I have in my rolodex  right now that can help them  with this property.\n| JO E MC C ALL 116\n• Use an ROI Investment  Property  Calculator  from places  like DealCheck.io,  BiggerPockets.\ncom or  RealEstateTools.com.\n• Tell the audience that I will give them unique, personalized comps and data to this\nproperty  if they contact  me.\n• Tell the audience  I have the lenders  and people  in place  that can help them  finance,  rehab,\nand manage  this new property.\nI won’t worry about my content being perfect. It never will be. “Done is the new perfect.”\nAgain, I have to emphasise this, I will always make an offer in all my content at the beginning and  the\nend. I will always  ask for the sale. I’m not going  to worry  about  being  annoying.  Every  piece  of content,\nevery video, every podcast, every letter, every follow -up em ail, every SMS: I will always give a simple,\nclear CTA.\n3: Participate in Local Investor Groups\nMost cities  have local Meetup  groups  or Real Estate  Investment  Associations  (REIA’s).  I will go to all of\nthem  and pass out my business  cards  to everyone.  I’ll put flyers  on their cars in the parking  lot when\nthe meeting  has started.  I’ll tell everyone  that I am a “deal  finder”  and a “deal  creator.”  I’ll tell them  I am\nthe “premier  realtor  in the <City>  area for finding  deeply  discounted  properties  for my clients.”  I’ll have\nthe attitude  that it’s a privilege  to get to work with me, that I only can work with a few select  clients  and\nonly give my best leads  to my best buyers.  It’s a first-come,  first-serve  basis.\nThere are also local investor groups online. I’ll check out the local Facebook “buy-sell-trade” groups.\nThere  are large nationwide  realtor  / investor  Facebook  groups  that I will join. I will participate  in these\ngroups  and let people  know  who I am and what I do.\nOn BiggerPockets.com, I can get keyword alerts for my City keywords. I can search in their huge\ndirectory  and find who the active  local investors  are.\nWhenever I’m talking to anyone, I’ll always ask these questions:\n• Are you looking  for an investment  property  to buy in <City>?\n• Do you have a property  you would  like to sell?\n• Bonus:  Do you know  anyone  who does?\n4: Follow Up, Follow Up, Follow Up\nHere’s the truth: at least 90% of your business will come from the follow -up. On average, it’s going  to\ntake 6 to 7 touch  points  over 3 to 4 months  before  a customer  becomes  a client.\nSo I won’t  quit or give up too soon!  I’ll be relentless  in my follow -up. This is where  most people  fail in the\nbusiness.  They give up too early,  and they don’t  follow  up.\n| JO E MC C ALL 117\nHere are some things I will do for follow -up:\n• Send out daily  emails.\nº Write  an email  every  day, just 1 to 2 pages.  Teach  something  valuable  and practical.\nº Make  sure the emails  have a very clear  call to action.\nº Include  daily tips and updates  from the local and national  real estate  news.\nº Talk about  the latest  “Deal  of the Day.”\nº Talk about  the latest  video  I recorded  which  was just released.\n• Send out weekly  “9-Word”  emails  (from  Dean  Jackson).\nº “Are you still looking  for properties  in XYZ area?”\nº “Have  you found  an investment  property  in <City>  yet?”\nº “I have a hot pre-foreclosure  investment  property  in <City>.  You wouldn’t  be\ninterested  in it, would  you?”\nº “Want  a free list of all the local foreclosures  in <City>?”\n• Send SMS text messages  at least  once a month,  maybe  twice  a month.\n• Send voicemails  using  a system  like SlyDial  or SlyBroadcast.\n• Contact  everyone  in Facebook  Messenger  and LinkedIn.\n• Send personalized  videos  using  a system  like Bonjoro  or BombBomb.\nConclusion\nSo there you have it: a simple plan to get 100 leads in 30 days. I am 100% confident that this will work\nfor you if you keep it simple and “exec ute it violently.”\nGet a scorecard. Track your numbers. Get some accountability. Talk to 10 people a day. Answer your\nphone.\nDon’t overcomplicate this. Don’t think that your content and marketing has to look perfect and\nprofessional. The key is consistency  and follow -up.\nI know you can do it!\n| JO E MC C ALL 118\nJoshua Latimer\nFounder of SendJim\nJoshua  Latimer  started  as a pizza delivery  driver  living  in a\ntrailer  park with big business  dreams.

(That way we can get on the same page.)\nIn this chapter, I will be delivering to you powerful marketing insights that you likely have never  heard\nbefore  because  of your unique  situation.\nBelieve  it or not, whether  or not these  insights  will help you has more to do with you than it does with me.\nTo maximize  your real world  results  it is critical  that you commit  to the following  two items:\n#1 - You Must Learn, Not Just Read\nMany  people  confuse  reading  with learning,  and they are not the same  thing.  Your goal should  not be\nto complete  this chapter  or finish  this book.  Rather,  it should  be to attain  mastery  at applying  online\nmarketing  to your local home  service  business.\n#2 - You Must Do The Work\nIn today’s  internet  guru age, more  and more  people  seem  to confuse  learning  with actually  doing.  This\nis a subtle  enemy  because  when  we learn  something,  it produces  a sense  of pride  and accomplishment.\nHowever,  I want  to warn you that this seemingly  small  difference  is actually  the primary  issue that\nseparates  the winners  and the losers.\nAttaining mastery requires you to do the hard work of applying these principles in your own business.\nThis means you have to be willing to endure the frustration that is inevitable as you sink into deep\nthought and try to apply this material to your specif ic situation in the real world.\nBefore we get started I have two quick tips to share:\nQuick Tip 1:\nPeriodically pause to feverishly scribble down your notes in an effort to actually apply the material  to\nyour real business. This is a requirement for mastery). Go slowly on purpose while doing the real work\nfor your specific  business.\nQuick Tip 2:\nPay close attention  to the following  pages  as it could  literally  be worth  millions  of dollars  in sales to your\ncompany  over the next few years.\nNow, let’s dive in…\n| JO SHU A L A T I M ER  120\nINTRO\nYou live in a uniquely different world as a home service business, and oh, do I get it.\nThere are challenges someone like you will face with your home service business that most online\nmarketers will never understand: employee issues, low priced competition, financial uncertainty,\ndeveloping predictable lead flow and more!\nThis alone  would  be enough  to cause  most online  entrepreneurs  to hyperventilate  into one of those\nairplane sick  bags.\nWith that being  said, there  is also massive  overlap  and a lot to be learned  from the internet  marketing\ncommunity.\nLuckily for me, I have lived in both worlds.\nMY QUICK BACKSTORY\nPhase 1:\n• I got married  at 20 years  old to my high school  sweetheart.\n• We lived in a trailer  park.\n• I was a pizza  delivery  guy.\n• We were broke.  I mean,  “we couldn’t  buy groceries”  kind of broke.\nPhase 2:\n• I got a “safe  and secure”  job at JP Morgan  Chase  bank.\n• I quit that job while  my wife was pregnant  with our first child.\n• I started  a window  cleaning  company  with zero savings.\n• We suffered.  I mean,  “our electricity  was shut off and our car repossessed”  kind of suffered.\nPhase 3:\n• I discovered  the concept  of “systems”  for my business.\n• Within  12 months  my business  tripled.\n• Within  5 seasons  I was selling  over $180,000  per month  working  5 hours  a week.\n• I sold my business  to a buyer  from California.\nPhase 4:\n• I moved  my family,  now with 4 kids, to Costa  Rica.\n• I launched  a software  and grew it to over $250,000  per month.\n| JO SHU A L A T I M ER  121\n• I launched a podcast helping home service businesses which has over 700,000\ndownloads  at the time of this writing.\n• I founded  an educational  company  which  is also a 7-figure  business  now.\nDid you catch it?\nIf you look closely, you can see where the shift happened for me and how the same shift can help you.\nThe very first bullet  point  under  Phase  3 was when  it all changed  for me. This is when  I first discovered\nthe concept  of “systems.”\nSystems  flipped  my world  upside  down  and sent my business  career  to the races.  The same  can be\ntrue for  you.\nLet me start by explaining a simple truth:\n“Your business is perfectly calibrated to give you exactly the result you are currently getting.”\nA friend of mine, Michael Kaplan, said that he built a carpet cleaning business from nothing to over\n$18,000,000  a year in less than a decade.\nSo what  is Michael’s  point?\nThe key to winning  in business  online  or offline  is systems.  If you are currently  struggling  or not making\nthe kind of income  you want  it is because  you need different  or better  systems.\nYes, it really is that simple.\nDisclaimer: I did not say it was easy. I said it was simple. There is a difference.\nYour Most Important System: Marketing\nMarketing is the foundational cornerstone of every single successful business on the planet. Period.\nMarketing  is like a water  spigot  for your business  and ideally  it should  be gushing  out leads  at 4 gallons\na minute.  However,  the average  local business  owner  has a spigot  that more  closely  resembles  dripping,\nnot gushing.\nIt is the bedrock  everything  else will be built upon.  Most local business  owners  are not obsessed  with\nmarketing  enough.  You need to be obsessed  with marketing  like Mr. Russell  Brunson  is obsessed  with\nmarketing.\nOne of the reasons why investing in a system like ClickFunnels is a smart move is because it was\nhandcrafted  by someone  obsessed  with marketing.  It is not an accident  that ClickFunnels  has produced\nhundreds  of 2 Comma  Club award  winners  over the past 5 years  (including  me).\nIt is a better system.\nLet’s Get to Work\nIf I was tasked  to use ClickFunnels  to get 100 new clients  for my local home  service  business,  the path\nwould  be pretty  simple.\n| JO SHU A L A T I M ER  122\nIn the following  pages,  I am going  to walk you through  the steps  I would  take to make  this a reality.\nHowever,  first I need to establish  some  basic  concepts  as a foundation.\nFOUNDATIONAL CONCEPTS\n1: Lifetime Value\nMost small home service businesses operate in a very “transactional” way.\nThey give a quote,  do a job, and move  on. This is normal  for many  people,  but it is a mistake.  We spend\ntoo much time chasing dollars and not enough time chasing long lasting relationships. We sometimes\nunintentionally  treat our clients  like one night  stands  rather  than a long-term quality  relationship.\nI think  it is due to a combination  of fear and scarcity  thinking,  but regardless  of why we do it, we need\nto shift our focus.\nYou need to make sure you have a solid sales strategy and follow -up system in place to take your\ncustomers through the entire journey of buying all of your services.\nWhen done correctly, the lifetime value of a great new client is 8 to 10 times the value of their  initial\ntransaction!\n2: Max C.A.C.\nWhat is your business’ maximum customer acquisition cost? In other words, how many dollars  can\nyou invest  to produce  one brand  new shiny  customer  and it still be worth  it?\nFiguring  this number  out is quite  simple  but it depends  on what  kind of services  you offer.  There  are\ntwo basic  types  of service  business  models:\nTYPE 1: Repeat Service\nYou offer a repeat service, something your client pays you for over and over again.\nTypically,  this type of business  will have a lower  average  ticket  price,  but the client  is repeatedly  paying\nyou over a long period of time. This could include services like lawn care, maid services, pest control,\nchild care and more.\nTo calculate your MAX C.A.C with a repeat service, look at two things:\n• How much  revenue  is one client  worth  (on average)  in one year?\n• What  is the average  profit  margin  on one average  client  after  paying  all expenses?\nFor example,  let’s say you mow lawns.  Your average  charge  is $40 per job, and you do 30 jobs per year.\nThat means  your average  annual  revenue  value  is $40 x 30, which  is equal  to $1,200.\nThen, figure out how much money the business retains after paying all costs associated with the\nservice.  Figure  out your material  costs,  your labor,  fuel, insurance,  overhead,  etc. In this example,  I will\nsay that the average  profit  margin  after all expenses  is 25%.\n| JO SHU A L A T I M ER  123\nThe last step is simple.\n$1,200  in annual  revenue  x 25% profit  margin  = MAX C.A.C.  of $300\nWhat  does this mean?\nIt means you could spend up to $300 to acquire a brand new shiny customer without losing money.\nIn addition  to that you will have their business  for years  to come  and keep 100% of the profits  going\nforward!\nTYPE 2: One -Time Service\nYou offer  a one time service  - something  that your client  hires you for once.  Then  it is unlikely  you will\nsee them  again  for many  years.\nTypically this type of business will have a much higher average ticket price, but the client is usually\nonly around for one transaction. This could include contractors, builders, flooring, swimming pool\ninstallation, roofers, etc.\nTo calculate your MAX C.A .C with a one time service, look at three things:\n• What  is the average  “ticket”  price?\n• What  is the profit  margin  on one average  client  after  paying  all expenses?\n• How much  of the profit  are you willing  to give away to acquire  a new client?\nFor example,  let’s say you are a roofing  company.  Your average  job is $15,000,  and your profit  margin\nis 20%.\nOn average, you will put $3,000 in your pocket for each new client you acquire. How much of that\n$3,000 are you willing to invest to get a new client?\nIt is up to you to decide,  but you need to establish  this number  so you have a benchmark.\nIn this example,  you could  invest  a maximum  of $1,000  and retain  $2,000.\nTo summarize, the MAX C.A.C.s of the two business types are:\n• Repeat  service:  MAX C.A.C  of $300\n• One time service:  MAX C.A.C  of $1,000\n3: The Value Ladder\nOne of the most impactful  things  I heard  Russell  say early  on in my ClickFunnels  journey  was,“amateurs\nfocus  on the front  end but professionals  focus  on the back end.”\nRussell  is simply  pointing  out that trying  to make  all of your money  on the very first transaction  with a\nnew client  cripples  your ability  to scale.  This is a huge deal!\nLocal  businesses  looking  to scale  quickly  using  ClickFunnels  need to understand  what  their “front  end”\noffer  should  look like.\n| JO SHU A L A T I M ER  124\nRussell Brunson is a master of what he calls the “value ladder”, and it is one of the secret weapons  he\nhas used to scale such a massive  company  so quickly.\nUsing  ClickFunnels  to grow your local business  is simple,  but you must stop and think  about  what  your\nvalue  ladder  looks  like.\nStep 1 is to take your overall  services  and break  them  into different  smaller  chunks  so you can create\na compelling  “front  end offer.”\nI will refer back to my lawn care example from earlier. Let’s pretend these are all of the services that\nABC Lawncare offers:\nSERVICE  ANNUAL AVERAGE REVENUE\nDriveway Edging  $50\nHedge Trimming  $300\nYard Debris Cleanup  $800\nMowing  $1,200\nFertilization  $1,500\nWhen  looking  at creating  a value  ladder  for your services  we want to list the services  from lowest  ticket\nprice to  highest.\nWhat is the easiest and simplest item that can be sold to a new prospect?\nTypically,  this will be one of the low ticket  services.  If you only offer  one single  service  ask yourself,\n“what  is something  small  I can do for a new prospect  that is low cost but high value?”\n• Maid Service?  Maybe  a $20 one time 45 minute  power  clean.\n• Roofer?  Maybe  a free roof inspection  or report.\n• Carpet  Cleaner?  Maybe  a free or very low cost spot clean.\n• Window  Cleaner?  Maybe  10 exterior  windows  cleaned  for $99.\nMake a list of potential front end offers for your home service company.\nRemember, you do not need to get rich instantly. You simply need some juicy bait to get your foot in\nthe door.\nTHE PLAN\nNow that we have established  some  basics,  let’s get into the nuts and bolts of how I would  get my next\n100 clients  using  ClickFunnels.\nThe basic concept is this: I am going to use a variety of juicy front end offers to “hook” new  potential\nclients. Then, I will be creating ads and sending traffic to a hyper -targeted ClickFunnels page so I can\ntrack  conversions.\n| JO SHU A L A T I M ER  125\nHere is a list of the things I will need:\n• Several  potential  front end offers  to test\n• A ClickFunnels  landing  page for each offer\n• Specific  copy for each ad and for my landing  page\n• Traffic\nI will go through each of these items one by one in a moment. First, I want you to realize that your\nwebsite is failing you in so many ways because of how broad it is.\nImagine this, you want to drive in 25 new customers for a 4th of July promotion. You create some\namazing  emails  and killer  ads with great  pictures,  but then what?  You send that traffic  to a website  full\nof general  information  or a boring  “contact  us” form.\nI need a hyper -targeted  landing  page specific  to my 4th of July offer!  I need a fun headline,  a little  body\ntext,  a list of benefits  and urgency/scarcity.\nHere is an example:\nWelcome all Grill -Masters! We have a limited time deal to help you DOUBLE the\namount of time you get to spend on the grill this holiday week.\nFor your lawn to truly represent the greatness  of America  this 4th of July, you need\nour Luxury  Lawn  and Landscaping  Spruce  up! Let us handle  the dirty work while  you\nman the  grill.\nWhat  you get for just $99 includes:  Driveway  and sidewalk  edging,  a fresh  mowed  lawn,\ntrimming  and blowing  included  for free PLUS a free 5 page landscaping  inspection\nreport.\nWe only have the capacity to handle 25 of these so don’t delay! Sign up now! Your\nlawn and you both deserve this!\nThe reason this is so powerful is that it is simple. It works because it is based on a fundamental\nmarketing  principle  called  hyper -targeting.  When  you have an ad with a very specific  offer that leads  to\na landing  page with exactly  the same  theme,  good things  happen.\nPlus, ClickFunnels is going to automatically track all of my clicks and my conversions! How cool is that?\nBecause  I know  my MAX C.A.C  and my offers’  conversion  rates,  it is easy to discover  which  front  end\noffers  are duds and which  ones are home  runs.\nI have a decade of experience using direct mail and even now I own a software company dedicated to\nhelping small businesses crush it with direct mail in their local market. Want to know one of the big\nsecrets b etween the winners and the losers with direct mail?\nHyper -targeting.\nHaving  simple  and clear messaging,  an irresistible  offer and an urgent  call to action  is the recipe  local\nservice businesses  need.\nHere is a step -by-step breakdown of the exact plan I will follow to acquire my 100 customers.\n| JO SHU A L A T I M ER  126\nSTEP 1\nIdentify the first irresistible front end offer.\nSTEP 2\nWrite unique and fun ad copy and landing page copy including the following elements:\n• Catchy headline  (hook)\n• Body text to add context\n• List of  benefits\n• Urgency  and/or  scarcity  (limited  time,  only 10 spots  etc)\nSTEP 3\nCreate  a simple  landing  page using  ClickFunnels  which  is fun and focused  100% on the one single  front\nend offer  from Step 1.\nSTEP 4\nCreate or find great images to use in the ad and on the landing page.\n(In the lawncare  example,  I would  be using  images  of flags,  fireworks,  grilling  and some  amazing  before\nand after photos  of lawns.)\nSTEP 5\nRepeat this process for each of the front end offers I want to test.\nSTEP 6\nStart driving traffic to my ClickFunnels landing pages.\nThere are many ways to drive traffic. Here is the process I would follow.\nExisting Client List\nI would  write  an email  seque nce of 3 to 5 emails  to send to my existing  list telling  them  about  my new\nlimited  time offer.  Each email  would  link to my landing  page and would  have a clear expiration  date for\nmy offer.\nI would  send ringless  voicemails  or text messages  to all of my clients  reminding  them  to check  their\nemail  because  we have a really  incredible  4th of July special  that they are going  to want  to know  about.\nFacebook (Personal Profile + Business Page)\nI would post 3 times per day on both my personal and business page explaining how excited I was about\nour limited time 4th of July “Luxury Lawn Spruce Up” special.\n| JO SHU A L A T I M ER  127\nI would focus on Facebook Live for at least one of them. For the other posts, I would use before and\nafter pictures or 4th of July related pictures.\nI would make sure to ask people to like and share each post.\nFacebook Ads\nI would  use Facebook  ads to hyper -target  the geographical  areas  where  I have the most customers  so\nfar.\nI would use the same copy on multiple ads, but create variations with different images.\nLocal Publicity\nI would  find a public  area to do a Luxury  Lawn  Spruce  Up for free, like a park,  playground,  cemetery  or\nother public  space.\nI would  also find 3 to 5 low income  elderly  couples  and give them  the Luxury  Lawn  Spruce  Up for free\nas well.  I would  talk about  these  giveaways  on my Facebook  Live videos  and ask people  to share  my\nposts.  I would  contact  all of the local newspapers  and TV stations  and pitch  them  on covering  our free\ngiveaways.  I would  document  and take a lot of videos  and pictures  of our free giveaways.  I have done\nthis in the past and it is VERY  easy to get local publicity  by contacting  reporters  directly.  They are\nalways  looking  for fun heartwarming  local stories.\nEverything  I have listed  above  could  be set up and ready  to go in less than a week’s  time.\nRemember  that marketing  spigot  we talked  about  earlier?  This is how I will get it gushing.\nQuick  Tip: Remember  that your job is simply  to take massive  imperfect  action.  Getting  hung up on the\nperfect  copy or the perfect  background  color  on your landing  page will slow you down  and kill your\nmomentum.\nSTEP 7\nMeasure results, and record the data.\nI will log into my ClickFunnels  account  and document  the conversion  rates  each day and at the end of\nmy campaigns.  I won’t  look at the data emotionally.  Rather,  I will critically  think  through  what  may be\noff or why people  may not be buying.\nIf the first launch is a dud, that is ok. I have created additional front end offers to test.\nFor my lawn care example,  if the 4th of July Luxury  Lawn  Spruce  Up did not perform  well,  I would\nsimply  begin  setting  up offer  #2.\nMaybe the #2 front end offer in this example could be for a National Chips And Salsa Day Special:\n“Get your lawn mowed for $1 plus get a free bag of chips and salsa on your doorstep!”\nRemember  from the above  MAX C.A.C calculations,  I can spend  up to $300 to acquire  one customer\nand still be 100% profitable  building  my business.\nIf it costs  me $25 in labor  (plus chips  and salsa!)  for each free mowing  with this special  deal,  I can do\n12 free mowings  and only need to get one good client  out of it!\n| JO SHU A L A T I M ER  128\nThat one good client will eventually ascend up my value ladder and buy additional services, making\nthem potentially worth $3,850 a year in revenue if they buy all of the services my example company\noffered.  If that client  stays with me for 6 years,  that is a grand  total of $21,300  in lifetime  revenue  from\none single  client.\nRemember, amateurs focus on the front end, and professionals focus on the back end.\nClickFunnels  makes  it easy to build  these  landing  pages,  and in most cases  you can have one live in\nonly a few minutes.  It is also easy to split test your copy and quickly  make  changes  on the fly in only\nseconds.\nI have lived in both the brick  and mortar  local small  business  world  and the online  internet  marketing\nworld,  and I can tell you with certainty  that ClickFunnels  is the single  greatest  tool for online  sales I have\never seen.\nADDITIONAL THOUGHTS\nI have personally  coached  over 1,000  home  service  business  owners  through  one-on-one phone  calls,\ncourses  and live events  over the past 5 years  through  one of my companies,  Automate  Grow  Sell.\nBeing  privileged  to work with so many  people  just like you, helped  me discover  the simple  truth  of how\nto win in  business.\nIt really boils down to 2 simple items:\nCommunity + Clarity = Your Ability to CONQUER\nThese  2 simple  items  must be in place  for you to succeed  in business,  life or even just getting  100 new\nclients  using  ClickFunnels.  ClickFunnels  provides  you with both required  items.\n1. Community\nOne of the big secret  weapons  you’ll  receive  from using  ClickFunnels  is the community  they provide.\nClickFunnels  has over 200,000  small  business  owners,  known  as “funnel  hackers”,  just like you in their\nfree Facebook  group  at the time of this writing.\nFunnel  hackersare  generous,  smart,  obsessed  with learning  and alwayssharing  their new breakthroughs\nin the Facebook group. The value of that community is immeasurable. If you get stuck on something,\nthe perfect  people  to help you are waiting  inside  of this group.\n2. Clarity\nThis book is essentially  an idea factory,  and although  ideas  are fun, action  wins the day. The aim of this\nbook is to get your gears  turning  and help give you clarity  on your next steps  using  ClickFunnels.\nTake bits and pieces from each chapter and turn it into a clear plan of action for yourself. Adapt the\nconcepts and ideas for your specific situation. Actually put your plan to paper so you can formalize  it.\nIf you do this, when  complete,  you will have the required  clarity  to take the next step.\nDon’t  procrastinate  until you think  you have all of the answers  to move  forward.  Just focus  on getting\nthe initial  clarity  needed  to start Step 1, and then go!\n| JO SHU A L A T I M ER  129\nNever in human history has it been easier than it is right now to build a business quickly.\nDon’t watch from the sidelines.\nGet in the  game.\nYour biggest fan,\nJosh\n| B R I C K & MOR TAR F U N N E L  S 130\nKrista Mashore\nOwner/Broker/CEO of\nKrista Mashore Coaching\nRealtor,  broker,  best selling  author,  trainer,  speaker,  and coach  Krista\nMashore  developed  a highly  successful  real estate  career,  having  sold\nover 2,000  homes  in her career  and being  ranked  in the Top 1% of\nRealtors  in the entire  nation.

I’m going  to take this\nstep seriously  knowing  I’ll have a much  higher  success  rate of implementing  and achieving  what  it is\nthat I want  if I do this step!\nThe thing  I’ve learned  is that no one ever gets anywhere  if they don’t  have a vision.  You can’t  get to\nOmaha  if you don’t  have a vision  of where  Omaha  is. You can’t  bake a great  birthday  cake if you don’t\nhave a vision  of what that cake looks  and tastes  like. You sure can’t  create  a great  life for yourself  if you\ndon’t  know  what  that looks  like either.\nDigging Deeper Into Why\nNow that I’ve answered  that question,  I want to go a little deeper  to find my real motivation.  For example,\nI might have said, “I want to make more money.” Well, why do I want to make more money? “Because\nI want to be able to have a little more financial security.” Well, why do I want to have more financial\nsecurity? “Well, I want to make sure that, if anything happens to my husband, I’m okay.” Now that’s a\npretty strong  why.\nI know getting 100 new clients or contacts is going to be challenging, so identifying my true “why” is\nimportant.  When  I get frustrate d and want to quit or give up, I won’t.  I’ll push through  because  I know\nmy reasoning behind  it.\nI’ll think about where I am with my life right now. Asking some of these questions might help:\n• How much  business  do I have?\n• Where  am I getting  it from?\n• How much  do I want?\n• What  is my strategy  now?\n• What  is my plan to increase  my business?\nI’ll be honest  with myself,  truly evaluating  where  I am now will help give me clarity.  I’ll be able to see\nmore  clearly  what I really  want.  Looking  back at my vision  may help me with this. I need something  to\ncompare  to. I must remember:  if I always  do what I’ve always  done,  I’ll always  get what I’ve always  gotten.\nOkay,  so I have my baseline  of where  I am today.  Now, I’ll ask myself,  “If I could  have my life look any way\nI want it to, how would  it look? If I could  have my real estate  dream  job, live in my dream  home  wherever\n| KRIS TA MA S HO R E  132\nI want to be in the world,  have all the things  I want,  and be with the people  I really  want to be with,  what\nwould  my perfect  life look like?”\nI will think  about  all areas  of abundance,  not just money.  What  would  this perfect  life look like spiritually,\nfinancially, my relationship with my spouse, my children, my friends and within the community? How\nwould I view myself and feel about myself? What would it look like in my vocation, my job or career?\nHow about my health, mentally, emotionally and physically? What could I be, do or have that would\nbring  my level of satisfaction  and happiness  to a 10?\nAbundance  is the whole  spectrum  of my world  and the reality  in which  I live.When  I talk about  abundance,\nplease  know  I’m not just talking  about  money.  I’m talking  about  the entirety  of life, both inside  and out\nas a whole,  not just in real estate.  The way one feels about  oneself,  their accomplishments  and where\nthey are in life are also a huge part of what  I mean  when  speaking  of abundance.  As it has been said,\n“Don’t  trade  happiness  for money.”  Sadly,  too many  people  didn’t  listen  to that wisdom.\nWhat does my perfect life look like? I’ll dream big when answering that question. Dreams can truly\nbecome  our reality  if we take actionable  steps  on a consistent  basis to get there.  That’s  what this book\nis meant to help you do. We are primarily focusing on the business aspect of it, but where you see\nyourself  and being  able to attain  that epic life, has a lot to do with when,  where,  how you actually  show\nup in your  business.\nI will take the time to brainstorm  and write  down  exactly  what  my vision  for my new life is going  to be.\nWithout  a clear  vision,  it will be much  harder  to achieve  my goals.\nGoals\nSetting goals is incredibly important in the real estate business, and I need to treat it just like that: a\nbusiness.  A goal is a specific  result  I want to create.  A goal might  be, “I will sell 60 units in the next 12\nmonths.”  That’s  a good,  clear goal. It makes  some  of my specific  action  steps  obvious:\nI need to be working  directly  with buyers  and sellers.  I need to show  up exactly  where  they are. I need\nto be seen,  to be heard  and to be known  as soon as possible.  I need to align myself  with the correct\npartners,  (e.g. preferred  lender,  title reps, home  inspectors,  appraisers).  I need to find a company  to\nwork for that has a good reputation  and get my license  hung.  I need to expose  myself  quickly  to the\nmasses.  I need to be seen and positioned  as the authority  in the area.\nI need both long term (five years)  and short  term (monthly  and weekly)  goals  to keep moving  forward.\nIf I just set long term goals,  I won’t  be as motivated  to complete  them.  Right  now I am in survival  mode,\nso I need clear  cut goals  which  dictate  exactly  what each day will look like over the next 30 days.  The\nshorter  the timeframe  when  setting  goals,  the more  likely  I will meet  them.  When  something  is too\nfar out in the future,  I feel no urgency  to get it done.  Like most people,  I’ll just keep putting  off doing\nanything  about  it. Weekly  and monthly  goals  will keep me accountable  and keep me focused.  Since  I\nam going  for 100 new clients,  I’ll need to be precise  about  my goal over the next few months,  weeks\nand days.  The other  thing  about  short  term goals  is that they give me wins along  the way. Long term\ngoals  are a marathon,  not a sprint.  My ultimate  vision  of what  I want  to create  won’t  happen  overnight,\nso I need to have smaller,  short  term goals  which  help me feel like I’m getting  somewhere  and making\nprogress.  Success  breeds  success,  so I will celebrate  my wins.\nI’ll start by laying  out my monthly  goals.  On a 3”x5”  card,  I will write:  “By the end of the month,  I will have\naccomplished  these  primary  objectives/goals.”  Then,  I will fill in the weekly  goals for the month:  “Within\nthe first week  I will have accomplished  X, Y, Z.” Then I will do this for the second,  third,  and fourth  week\nso that by the end of the month,  my macro  (larger)  goal is complete.\n| KRIS TA MA S HO R E  133\nIt’s also very important  to have daily goals.  Each day, I will write  down  6 things  that I absolutely  must\nget done.  When  I get them  done,  I will pat myself  on the back and celebrate  my success.  I will put the\nhardest  items  first on my list and timeblock  in my calendar  when  I will do each of the items.  I should  be\nworking  at minimum  a 10 hour day. 6.5 hours  should  be items  on my list that must be accomplished.\nThe other 3.5 hours are for things that come up in the day that are unexpected, checking emails,\npicking  up kids, and more.\nWhat  I won’t  do is beat myself  up if I am not able to get done what  I hoped  to accomplish  each day.\nThings  come  up that take precedence  and priority  over my goals.  I’ll just move  that goal over to the\nnext day and pat myself  on the back for all I’ve accomplished,  but I will pay attention  to these  goals  to\nensure  I’m always  moving  forward  with what  I need to have accomplished  by the end of the month.  I’m\nin a marathon,  not a sprint.  Rome  wasn’t  built in a day, right?  But, for the sake of the next 100 days,  I\nam in a little  bit of a sprint,  and I need to get my mindset  around  exactly  what  I will do over the next 100\ndays to ensure  my success.  I am going  to be very precise  and intentional  about  everything  that I do.\nHere are a few examples of things that may go into my daily plan, but it is not limited to this list alone.\nPersonal Daily Tasks\nWake up each morning, give thanks, and show gratitude for everything that I have in my life.\nVisualize  my day and see myself  succeeding.  I know  that I need to get my mind  right.  I get what  I think,\nso I keep my mind  positive  at all times.  Even when  it gets hard and I want  to quit, I keep pushing.\nVisualize  what  my day will look like the next day. If I can, I try to write  out my 6 items  I need to get done\nfor the next day and time block  them.  Doing  this in the evening  is helpful  but hard,  so if I can’t  do it in\nthe evening  for the next day, I will do it in the morning.)\nGive myself permission to dream and get what it is that I need while I’m sleeping.\nRead my manifesto. I know this is imperative because, coming from nothing, I need to get my mind i n\ncheck and ensure I am focused on my outcome: SUCCESS!\nDaily Business Tasks\nPost free, useful  quality  content  daily on my Facebook  page that will help position  me as an authority\nfigure.  My goal is to get my content  to be so helpful  and useful  that it is shared  and liked many  times.  I\nalso want  tons of engagement  on it. This will help with organic  reach.\nRecord 3 videos per week (not including home videos,  those are additional) and run ads to each video.\nAdd value and serve; don’t sell. Research and kno w anything and everything about my community and\nshare that knowledge through video to position myself as the expert authority. My goal is to ensure\nthat if anyone thinks about anything community or real estate related in my area, they think “Krista.”\nGo the extra  mile in everything  that I do.\nAdd these  videos  into my ClickFunnels  funnels,  and direct  the traffic  from the video  content  that is\ncreated  into the “funnel”  I have running  for the month.\nSend 10 personalized  video  text messages  and emails  to everyone  I meet,  past clients  and those  within\nmy sphere  of influence.  Be as consistent  as possible  in everything  that I am doing.  Never  ask for a\nreferral;  just give a compliment  or recognize  something  that they have achieved.  (Checking  out their\n| KRIS TA MA S HO R E  134\nsocial  media  sites helps  me gain knowledge  of what  to take note of when  sending  these  personalized\nvideos  out.)\nKnow what’s going on in my market. Study the MLS. Know what’s being reduced or listed in my target\nmarkets. Always have a few specific homes in mind in each price range so when people call I sound\nknowledgeable.\nGet out in the community.  Being  seen and immersing  myself  into the community  and its culture  is\nvital.  Daily I need to block  out time to be involved  in some  type of community  event  so I am seen.  This is\ngoing  to be tough  because  I’m busy,  but I have to be seen so that when  I run my campaigns  and funnels,\npeople  start putting  my face with the ads and funnels  that I’m running.  There  is no replacement  for\nme and the relationships  I build  with people.  Explore  things  like the Chamber  of Commerce,  interest\ngroups  (moms,  wine,  sports,  business),  BNI group  etc.\nCommit to the 8 C’s to a Complete Sales System:\n1. Commit\n2. Content\n3. Consistently\n4. Convert\n5. Connect\n6. Complete\n7. Cycle\n8. Circle  (Full Sales  Circle)\nBreaking  that down.  I know  if I commit  to creating  content  consistently  that I will convert  my leads.\nI have to continue  to connect  with them  through  continually  and consistently  creating  the content  I\nknow  will develop  a connection  with them.  If I am committed  to completing  this cycle  over and over, I\nknow  I will have a complete  full sales cycle.\nCommit  to the Full Circle  Sales  Process.  Getting  leads  is the easy part utilizing  my ClickFunnels  account\nand funnels,  I need to also focus  on all phases,  2 through  5, because  that’s  where  the true money  will\ncome  in. The sales process  isn’t just about  getting  leads.\nI need to focus on the 5 phases of the sales process:\n• Generating the  leads\n• Nurturing the  leads\n• Converting the  leads\n• Giving  them  a 5-star experience,  knocking  their socks  off once they are a client\n• Refer, Retain,  Resell\n• Request  reviews\nFollow up constantly with my leads. This is an ongoing process, and the lead nurturing phase of my\nbusiness  is one of the most important.  That’s  why my Facebook  retargeting  is going  to be so important\nbecause  I am inadvertently  prospecting  through  my Facebook  campaigns  at all times.\n| KRIS TA MA S HO R E  135\nDay 2\nNow I have my ‘why’, vision and goals. It’s time to rock it out!\nFirst,  I will ensure  that I have my branding  guidelines  on point.  I will choose  colors  and the overall  theme\nof how I want  my brand  to be perceived.  I’m going  to search  for ‘wedding  palettes’  on Pinterest  so I\nknow  I’m using  colors  that go together  and compliment  each other.  It’s imperative  to stick with that\nbranding  throughout  all of my social  media,  marketing,  websites  and more.\nThis information on branding could be an entire book. Branding is much more than just colors and a\npicture.  My brand  defines  who I am, how I run my business  and the clients  I want to attract,  so I will put\neffort  into this. Truly knowing  who my client  is and what niche  I want to focus  on will save me marketing\ndollars in the  future.\nNext,  I will pick and define  my niche.  I won’t  get intimidated  or afraid  to do this. Just because  I“specialize”\nin a certain  niche  doesn’t  mean  people  won’t  come  to me outside  of this niche.  Rather,  it ensures  that\nwhen people need a property in the niche that you specialize in, you will at least come to mind. Here\nare a few examples  of niches:\n• homes  on the water\n• riverfront  homes\n• rural homes\n• high rise  studios\n• specializing  in a certain  community  or neighborhood\n• luxury  homes\n• homes  on the delta\n• homes  close  to fast water\n• secondary  homes\n• lifestyle  homes\n• investment  homes\n• first time  buyers\n• move up buyers/sellers\n• REO/Foreclosure  specialist\n• dual family  homes\n• the millennial  buyer\n• retirement  communities\n• certain  subdivisions\n• condos\n• horse  properties\n• land\nI can really  define  my niche,  and it’s something  I’m going  to have to do some  work later on in the month.\nI will eventually  create  specific  funnels  with Clickfunnels  for each niche  that I identify,  so I will put some\n| KRIS TA MA S HO R E  136\neffort and thought into this now, picking something that I love so it won’t seem like work.\nNext,  I will choose  my slogan.  Currently  in my business,  mine is: “When  you do what  you love, people\nlove what you do.” Other  examples  could  be: “Serving,  Selling,  Smiling”  or “From  my heart  to your home.”\nAfter  that,  I will find a professional  photographer  to take photos  of the community  so that I can utilize\nthem  for my marketing  materials.  I want  it to look like I’m immersed  in the community  as if I’m a\nnative.  I’ll also ensure  I have an updated  photo  of myself  to use on all of my marketing  materials.  These\ninclude,  but aren’t  limited  to: my Facebook  page,  website,  business  cards,  brochures,  flyers,  Instagram,\nsigns,  and more.  I’ll need to find a professional  photographer  to take 6 to 10 photos  of me.\nI’ll need some  “clear  cut” pics of myself,  so I will have some  photos  taken  with a blank  or solid color\nbackground.  This will make  the backgrounds  easier  to remove.  To do that,  I will open an account  with the\nonline  tool “Clipping  Magic.”  Once  the background  in my photos  is removed,  I can place  my remaining\nimage  onto a variety  of backgrounds  to use in my marketing  pieces.\nI’ll also open an account  with Stencil  or Canva  so I can create  Facebook  Ads, email  banners,  and other\ncool marketing  pieces  that will go in my funnels.  This will ensure  that my social  media  content  looks\nmore  appealing  and gets more  attention.  The more  eyes,  the better!\nFinally, I will create my business card and print them myself or have them sent to Vista Print or\nOverNightPrints.com  to be printed.  I will hand these  out everywhere  I go when  exploring  the town.\nAnyone  I meet  from the server  at a restaurant  to the dry cleaner  I use will get a card from me. I will\nmake  sure my business  cards  direct  recipients  to my Hero Funnel  so they can get to know,  like and\ntrust me.\nDay 3\nOn Day 3, I will focus  on testimonials  and social  proof.  I would  go back to past clients  (they  don’t  have\nto live in your current  neighborhood)  and ask them  to give me testimonials  about  their prior service\nwith me. Video  testimonials  are preferred  if I can get them.\nSocial proof shows other potential buyers that I provide excellent service, know my stuff and am an\nexpert. I know this is a must and will give me a competitive edge, especially since I may not know\nanyone in my new community yet.\nOnce I have receive d the testimonials,  here is all that I will do with them  (using  people’s  pictures  helps\nand give the user the feeling  that they are a “real”  review):\n1. Ensure  they are on my website.\n2. Get as many  on Zillow,  Realtor.com,  Yelp, my Facebook  business  page,  etc.\n3. Put testimonials  on any marketing  materials  that I have.\n4. Put testimonials  in my funnels  built with ClickFunnels.\nA fast and easy way to get testimonials  quickly  and entice  my past clients  to want  to give me a review\nis to run a contest.  I will let them  know  that I am doing  a drawing  for anyone  who gives  a review.  Each\ntime I get a review  from them  on Yelp, Zillow,  Facebook  or other  platform,  I’ll enter  their name  into a\ndrawing  to win a gift card.  I previously  did this using  an iPad as a prize  and got about  30 reviews  within\na two week  time period.\n| KRIS TA MA S HO R E  137\nNext,  I will set up all of my social  media  profiles  on the major  platforms:  Facebook,  Instagram,  YouTube\nand LinkedIn.  It’s impossible  to master  all of these  sites initially,  so I will choose  one to master,  moving\non to another  only after I have mastered  the first. Then,  once I move  to the next platform,  I will learn\nthe new platform but not stop doing everything I did on the first platform. My first focus would be on\nFacebook, and then I’d move to Instagram. The campaigns that I am running on Facebook can also be\nrun on  Instagram.\nFinally, I will take a break from the computer and get out there and meet people. I’ll wear my name tag\neverywhere  I go so people  start to put my face with my name.  I’ll continue  to do my daily tasks (see list above).\nDay 4\nI will set up a landing  page inside  my ClickFunnels  account  that I can send my prospects  to. Clickfunnels,\nin my opinion,  is the easiest  way to set up a landing  page,  so I’m going  to create  a simple  landing  page\nfor now just to have something  out there.  Later  on I can add to it and make  it more  robust.\nI also know it’s super important to have a pixel on my new website so I can track who’s visiting my\nwebsite  and then have the ability  to remarket  to them.  It is also imperative  to have a pixel so when  they\ngo to my landing  page,  I know  what they are doing  once they get there.\nI will set up a business page on Facebook for myself and ensure that my branding is on point  from\nabove.\nNext, I will create an ads manager account through Facebook to run all of my ads and videos on.\nRunning  ads through  my ads manager  account  will also allow  me the ability  to target  my market  and\nto retarget  my prospects.\nFinally,  I will go to Fiverr.com  and find fast and inexpensive  people  to whom  I can outsource  my video\nediting  and lead magnet  creation  (which  I will utilize  in my campaigns  and funnels).  I will look for\nsomeone  who is good at editing  videos  and someone  who is good with graphics.  They most likely  will\nbe two different  people.  This way I am not wasting  my time editing  videos  or doing  the creative  part of\ncreating  my marketing  materials  in the future.\nDay 5\nNow it is time to record  my videos.  All I need is a camera  on a phone,  so I don’t  need to stress  too much\nover this. I need to position  myself  as the expert  in town.  Getting  people  to know,  like and trust me is\nimperative. My goal is to become the expert authority of both real estate and anything community\nrelated.  My goal is to get people  in my new town to think  about  me when  they think  about  real estate.\nI will be giving them pure value and cont ent on a consistent basis about anything community or real\nestate -related.\nI really  want to brand  myself  quickly,  so I will create  a minimum  of 3 videos  a week  and run a Facebook\nad campaign  for each of them  to drive viewers  back to my funnel.  I will use the “reach”  objective.  This\nwill allow  me to get my videos  in front of as many  people  as possible  on all of the videos  in the beginning.\nI will change  my objective  depending  on how quickly  my reach  grows  on Facebook.  I will also use other\nobjectives  using  the same  video  to ensure  that I am being  seen as often  as possible.  This is imperative\nto develop  a relationship  with my community.  I will do videos  about  the community,  such as new things\nto do and local hot spots.  I’ll spend  this day writing  my scripts,  checking  out the city, finding  local hot\nspots  of where/what  I can do my videos  on.\n| KRIS TA MA S HO R E  138\nMy goal is to do one real estate -related  video  (tips and tricks),  one niche  video  related  to my specific\nniche  I’ve chosen  to dominate,  and one community -related  video.\nThere  needs  to be a good mix of community -related  videos  as well as real estate  specific  videos.  Here\nare a few examples  of real estate  videos  I could  do:\n• 3 Tips to Maximize  The Sale of Your Home\n• 7 of the Deadliest  Mistakes  Buyers  Make\n• Credit Repair  Must’s\n• How the Absorption  Rate Dictates  What  You Should  Price  Your Home  For\n• Interest  Rates  Are Increasing  and How That Affects  a Buyer/Seller\nHere are some  community -related  video  examples:\n• Interviewing  a local restaurant  owner\n• New things  to do or try depending  on the season\n• Local hot spots\n• Best places  to take your sweetie  on a date\n• Best happy  hour places\n• Meals  under  $10.00  in the area\n• Best dog  parks\nThese videos will be continually running.\nIf my niche is “waterfront homes,” here are some examples of real estate videos that I could do:\n• The difference  in location  in proximity  to fast water\n• The best type of exposure  to look out for when  buying  a waterfront  home\n• How to properly  care for a waterfront  home\nI want to become an expert in my niche and constantly be giving advice and tips. This is so essential\nbecause it will enhance your SEO (search engine optimization). When people search for “waterfront\nhomes,” I want to show up in their search results.\nDay 6\nToday,  I will create  a landing  page and market  it through  my Facebook  Ads Manager  by using  videos  I’ve\nrecorded  and first posted  to my business  page.\nI post the videos  first on my business  page.  Then,  I’ll pull the ad from there  and run the ad through  my Ads\nManager  account.  This will ensure  that I can use the same  video  and then easily  change  the objective.\nI’ll create  retargeting  ads, bringing  people  down  my funnel.  The more  a lead engages with my ads and\ngoes to the bottom of the funnel, the more likely that they are a buyer who is ready to buy or a  seller\nwho is ready  to sell.\n| KRIS TA MA S HO R E  139\nI will continue  to create  videos  around  my niche.  Remember,  I may have more  than one niche.  The more\ninformation and content I put out into the world regarding a specific niche, the more likely I’ll “show\nup” when people are searching online. For example, I brand myself as a specialist on homes on deep\nwater in Discovery Bay (DB). In my first video, I could explain how homes on deep water in DB differ\nfrom homes  that are not on the deep water.  In a second  video,  I could  explain  how and why homes  with\neastern exposure sell for more money. In my third video, I could detail how homes that are closer to\nfast water sell for more money and more quickly. In a fourth video, I could discuss which are the best\nand closest  restaurants  in DB and how to get to them  by boat.  I’ll do this exact  format  above with 2 to\n3 niches  that I choose.\nToday  I will also create  several  lead magnets  to advertise  using  funnels  within  my ClickFunnels  account.\nI will run ads behind  them  to generate  more  leads.  My goal in using  a lead magnet  is to offer something\nof value  like a PDF, video  with tips and tricks,  or free guides  to my targeted  audience.  Initially,  I’ll just\ngive all of this information away for free until I develop a relationship with my community and earn\ntheir trust.  Once I’ve done that, I’ll continue  to offer content  and information  but then ask for the lead’s\ncontact  information.  I know  it is essential  to first gain their trust prior to asking  them  to give me any of\ntheir information.  Once  I do this, they will be more  willing  to give me their contact  information.\nDay 7\nOn Day 7, I will join as many  local community  Facebook  groups  as possible.  Doing  so will give me online\nspaces  where  I can give as much  value  as possible.  I will be helping  and serving  others  in these  groups,\nnot selling.  I will spend  at least an hour each day posting  and commenting  within  as many  of these\ngroups  as possible.  I want  to get my name  out there,  and there  is no better  way to do this than in\nFacebook  groups.\nNext, I will create a YouTube channel. I will post the videos I have recorded on my YouTube channel\neach time I make  them  from this point  forward.  This will also help me with search  engine  optimization\nthrough Google when people run searches. I pay special attention to how I describe each video and\nhow I title each video  on YouTube  so that the video  will come  up when  people  do searches.\nI will also run paid ads on Instagram,  which  is getting  a lot of traction  right now because  the ad cost is\nvery affordable.  All of the ads that I create  on Facebook  will provide  the option  to me to run them  on\nInstagram  as well,  which  I will do.\nFinally, I will research information for videos that will be recorded on Day 8.\nDay 8\nOn Day 8, I will create  “buyer  and seller  guides”  which  I can give to prospective  people  that I meet  from\nmy marketing  endeavors.  I can and will also use these  guides  to give away  when  people  opt into my\nlanding  pages  and funnels.\nI will choose a good customer relationship management (CRM) software also. (Today I personally use\nRealvolve.) I know this is important because soon I am going to be running massive campaigns and\ngenerating hundreds of leads. I need to ensure that my leads are put on action plans and have follow\nup campaigns.  I don’t  want to risk even one lead getting  away from me. I will use Zapier  to get my leads\nfrom my Facebook  campaigns  into my CRM automatically.\n| KRIS TA MA S HO R E  140\nDay 9\nDay 9 is all about preparing for a “Buyers and Sellers Seminar.”\nI will create a home seller seminar funnel, driving traffic through a video series and inviting people  to\nthe event.  (I will plan to record  the video  of me teaching  the seminar  to use later and run an evergreen\nbuyer/seller seminar  funnel.)\nI will run this ad for 7 days prior to the actual  event.  I will use Zapier  to ensure  that my leads  that come\nin through my Facebook ad go directly into my CRM and are automatically given the information  about\nthe seminar.  I will then put them  on the Buyer/Seller  workflow  in my CRM.\nHere is the list of steps  involved  in setting  up my seminar:\n1. Determine time and  location\n2. Prepare  slides  for presentation\n3. Create  Facebook  ads to drive  traffic\n4. Create  the Buyer/Seller  seminar  funnel  in ClickFunnels\n5. Set up CRM to automatically  send out the videos  and reminders  to attendees\n6. Create  a video  explaining  what  to expect  for the Buyer/Seller  seminar\n7. Create  a “thank  you” video  to show  leads  who register  for the seminar\n8. Create  a reminder  video  reminding  them  of the event  and sending  it out the day before\n9. Create  sign in sheet  to have available  for the presentation\nDays 10 -11\nOn Days 10 and 11, I will create an “Open House List” Facebook ad to run over the weekend from\nThursday to Sunday. This will be something like:\nClick below to get your FREE list of open homes in Discovery Bay!\nLeads  will give me their name  and phone  number  in order  to get this list. From past experience,  I know\nI should be able to get anywhere from 39 to 61 people requesting this list. BOOM! I’m in business. I’ll\nmake sure I use Zapier to ensure that the leads that I’m generating from my ad are going directly  into\nmy CRM so I can contact  them  immediately.  I will keep in constant  contact  with them  and put them  on\na proper  workflow.\nI can also duplicate  this process  with a lead magnet  and ad that answers  the question,  “What  is my\nhome  worth?”:  Why would  I do that?  I know  that people  who are requesting  an open house  list are most\nlikely  active  buyers,  but I also know  that homeowners  who are requesting  to learn  their home  value  are\nthinking  of selling.  These  two lead magnets  and ads allow  me to reach  both sides of the market.\nDay 12\nI will call, text,  email,  and send video  messages  to all of the leads  requesting  the open house  list and\n‘What’s  my home  worth?’  I will not give up on any of these  leads  and will continue  to call and offer  my\nhelp,  guidance  and support  until they tell me to stop calling  them.  The average  agent  stops  trying  to\n| KRIS TA MA S HO R E  141\nget in touch  with a lead after  two touch  points.  I know  it takes  an average  of twelve  times  (study  done\nfrom Harvard),  so I will not stop until they tell me to stop calling  them.  I know  that I should  pick up a\nminimum  of 3 buyers  over the next 21 days.  Again,  with all of the ads I run, I make  sure that my leads\nare running  right into my CRM so I don’t  lose track  of them  and continue  to make  constant  contact  and\ncommunication.\nI will also hand deliver  a Current  Market  Analysis  to any of the prospective  sellers  that requested  a CMA.\nThey will also get a copy emailed  to them,  but I know  that by hand delivering  a CMA in a beautifully  well\nput-together  package,  I will make  traction  with the sellers.\nDay 13\nI’ll run around  town  again  getting  myself  familiar  with neighborhoods.  I need to immerse  myself  in\nthe community.  I need to know  what  so-called  “nicer”  areas  are and why. I’ll use my MLS to identify\ndifferent  price  ranges  so I am familiar  with all of the different  price  ranges  that there  are in the area.\nOne of my daily “to-do’s”  is getting  to know  different  price  ranges  for homes  and knowing  what’s  been\nreduced  or what  is new. This will give me a chance  to actually  see the areas  and homes  I’m familiarizing\nmyself  with.  I will continue  to do this weekly  or biweekly  if needed.\nDay 12 -14\nDays 12 to 14 should  include  video  repurposing.  I will go back to all of my videos  and repurpose  them.\nI will do these  steps  each time I do a video,  and they should  be added  into my workflow  in the future.\nThe videos  can be used individually  on landing  pages  made  through  ClickFunnels  as well as on a funnel\nfor a specific  topic,  such as buyer/seller  seminar  funnels,  home  evaluation  funnels,  open house  list\nfunnels,  specialty  list funnels,  credit  repair  funnels,  seller  funnels,  buyer  funnels,  and more.\nHere are the steps I would include in my workflow to ensure I was repurposing my videos properly:\n1. Send video to Rev.com. It costs $1.00 per minute to get my videos transcribed.\nTruthfully, this should have already been done because I want the captions to show\nup on the videos  that I am playing  on Facebook  and other  platforms).\n2. Post the video’s  transcription  on Facebook  as longform  posts.  Use lots of emojis.\n3. Post video  to YouTube.\n4. Post video  on Instagram  as a paid campaign.\n5. Post video  on Facebook  as a paid campaign.\n6. Upload video onto my website to help with SEO to ensure I am showing up in\nsearch  results.\n7. Upload  the transcription  of the videos  onto my website.\n8. Create  a landing  page using  ClickFunnels  which  features  the video.\nDay 15 -30\nFrom this point  on, I will rinse and repeat  all of the steps  above.  Everything  to do with videos  and\nFacebook  I know  I need to do 3x per week  to stay in front  of my community  and be seen as the expert.\n| KRIS TA MA S HO R E  142\nMy mission  is to continue  running  ads, creating  funnels,  creating  landing  pages,  and using  video  to\nestablish  myself  as the expert,  showing  up to the masses,  and giving  as much  value  as possible.\nI also should be working with a few buyers by this point showing them properties as well as a  few\nsellers.  I’m meeting  with sellers  from the “what’s  my home  worth?”  ad campaign  I ran previously  and\nlisting  their homes.  I know  that anything  and everything  that I do for my homes  is a reflection  of me and\nhow I do business,  so I go ALL out on everything  that I produce.\nI will continue  to get more  testimonials.  It doesn’t  look good to have a bunch  of testimonials  and reviews\nall at one time but then not continue  to get them.  This is something  I need to continue  to do regularly.\nDay 18\nI will run my Buyer/Seller  Seminar.  I will get to my location  early  to ensure  the audio  and video  setup  is\nworking  properly  and remember  to record  the entire  event.\nWhen  it’s over, I will send out video  “thank  you’s”  to all attendees.  I will set up everyone  on a workflow\nin my CRM to ensure  there  is further  communication  and follow  up. I will then write  and send out thank\nyou cards  to all attendees.  I will work on Cumulative  Market  Analysis  and Absorption  Rate information\non each of the attendees  who were sellers  and drop it off to them  in person  the next day.\nDay 19 -20\nI will drop off and email  all CMA’s  that were done on Day 18 to the sellers  who were attendees.  I will take\nthe recordings from the seminar and put it into an actual training and make an amazing video  training\nof the event  to run an evergreen  webinar.\nDay 21\nI will create  3 more  videos  surrounding  another  niche  that is different  than the one I chose  earlier.  I will\nrun ad campaigns, create funnels and landing pages for each video. I’ll remember my video content\nrepurposing  workflow  and put all videos  on my website  along  with the transcriptions.\nDay 22 -100\nAt this point  I am now working  with clients  from all of the ads and funnels  that I’ve been running.  I will\ncontinue regularly to do all of the items above, then rinse and repeat them: creating videos, running\nads, ensuring everything is in my CRM, setting workflows, calling back clients, dropping off CMA’s,\nresponding  to leads  and calling  them  until they tell me to STOP!\nI am in action at this point, so setti ng up a schedule and ensuring that I follow it is imperative. Now\nI’m working. I’m showing homes, going on listing appointments. I’m getting contracts signed. Now, to\nensure that I don’t have the ebb and flow of business, I need to ensure I don’t quit doin g what got  me\nbusy in the first place. That is why I ensure I continue doing my list of daily tasks. If I keep doing this,\nrinsing  and repeating  all the steps  above,  I will be the community  market  leader  before  I know  it.\n| KRIS TA MA S HO R E  143\nFinal Thoughts\nUtilizing  this process  I’ve been able to close  on average  well over 100 homes  a year with our best year\nat 169 closed homes. This was not a huge team. This was done through just myself, a transaction\ncoordinator  and an assistant.  Now that my focus  is on training  and coaching,  my business  model  is\ndifferent  and I have help,  but this can be done without  a huge team.  It takes  a massive  amount  of action,\ntime and dedication  to complete  the process,  though.  Once  you’re  well known  enough,  your phone  will\nbe ringing,  and you won’t  have to do prospecting.  Notice  that in my plan there  was no mention  of open\nhouses,  door knocking  and cold calling.  These  are digital  marketing  strategies  that are relevant  to the\n21st century.\nBut remember,  the sales process  isn’t just about  getting  leads.  Success  requires  attention  be given  to\nall 5 phases  of the sales process.  Many  people  are so focused  on lead generation  in phase  1 that the\nrest suffers.  The 5 phases  are:\n• Generating the  leads\n• Nurturing the  leads\n• Converting the  leads\n• Giving  them  a 5-star experience,  knocking  their socks  off when  they are a client\n• Refer, Retain,  Resell\nAs a salesperson,  you need to be conscious  of all of the phases  of the sales process.  If one is off, then\nyou are losing  money.  Identifying  the pro’s and con’s  of each is what  ultimately  will ensure  that you\nhave a longstanding  business  that will withstand  any storm.\nContinue  to put a budget  behind  your funnels.  Give as much  value  as possible  and continue  to retarget\nbuyers  and sellers  when  they come  into your funnels  so you don’t  lose them.  You want  to continue  to\nstay top of mind.\nGive it the time it takes.  Rome  wasn’t  built overnight.  As much  as this plan is great  and should  get you\nrolling,  we all know  that it takes  time.  I find that it takes  about  4 to 5 months  of being  super  dedicated\nand consistent  to gain your watermark  on your community.  Don’t  stop running  your funnels,  ads and\nvideos  on month  three  because  you don’t  see the results  right away.  Your business  model  needs  to be\nlike a marathon.  You need to give it the time and dedication  it takes  and deserves.  Stay consistent,  and\npush forward.  By month  4 to 6, you’ll  see so much  momentum  in your business  that you won’t  know\nwhat  to do with yourself.\nConsistency  is your friend!  Never  quit. Don’t  stop doing  the things  that got you busy in the first place.\nBe a master  of your day and of your time.  Be intentional.  Learn,  implement,  master,  repeat!\n| B R I C K & MOR TAR F U N N E L  S 144\nMike Arce\nCEO of Loud Rumor\nMike Arce is the founder  and CEO of Loud Rumor,  an agency\nthat’s served over 1,400 fitness studios and wellness\ncompanies  throughout  the world.

I’ve actually been a part of studios gaining over 500 members\ninside  of 3 months!\nNow, I’m going to break down my step -by-step process on how to do it.\nThe Story\nFirst,  I have to break  down  the story of my studio.\nWhat’s my studio about? What makes it unique? Can members and prospects easily explain the\nconcept  to friends  and family  members?  Doing  so allows  me to double  or triple  the return  I’ll get on the\nmarketing  strategies  shown  later in this chapter.  How can that be? While  getting  a person  to sign up is\ngreat,  it’s much  better  if they bring  in friends  with them  so I can lower  my overall  acquisition  cost and\nspend  more  on marketing  to get more  members.\nOrangetheory  Fitness  is a great  example  of a company  that does “story”  well.  It’s really  easy for an\naverage  person  to explain  Orangetheory  Fitness  to a friend.  My cousin  (who knows  nothing  about  the\nfitness  business  and JUST joined  Orangetheory)  described  it this way:\n“It’s called  Orangetheory  because  everyone  wears  heart  rate monitors  while  working  out, and the results\nare displayed  on screens  around  the studio.  The section  that shows  your heart  rate changes  color from\nblue to green  to orange  to red throughout  class depending  on how fast your heart  is beating.  The goal is\nto be in the orange  zone for around  15-20 minutes,  as that zone will burn the most fat while  in class AND\nafter  you leave.  It’s called  the ‘afterburn’,  and it can last for up to 48 hours  after  class is over.”\nNow,  I know  that’s  not verbatim  how Orangetheory  explains  it, but it definitely  helps  the friend  of the\nstoryteller  understand  the story  of the fitness  studio  quickly  and feel comfortable  joining.\nF45 Training  is similar  in their ability  to convey  their main concept  quickly.  F45 stands  for functional\ntraining  in a 45 minute  workout.  No two workouts  are ever the same,  and you hop from zone to zone\nwith a friend  or workout  partner  throughout  the class to keep you motivated  and on track.\nHere is another.  CYCLEBAR  is a cycle  studio  that hosts  classes  in a bar or nightclub -type atmosphere.\nIt’s dark. Music is blasting, and the music videos are playing on HUGE monitors to get you going\nthroughout  the class.  You also have leaderboards  displaying  stats from the class participants  so you\ncan see where  you stand  in relation  to others  (especially  great  for the competitive  types).\nThere are so many great concepts out there that I’ve seen get an edge on other studios simply because\n| MI KE  AR CE 146\nit’s easy for them  to convince  their friends  to join them  in class.  If I can do this in my studio,  I can\nincrease  my return  on investment  each time I make  a sale.\nMy Ideal Member\nIt is crucial to know who my ideal member is. If I’m going to target females only (or mainly), then  the\nverbiage  in my ads is very different  than if I also wanted  to appeal  to men.  Most men don’t  get excited\nabout  ads that promise  to “build  your booty”  or “build  tone,  slender  arms and legs.”\nMy friend  Rick Mayo  likes to target  people  that are over 45 years  old. Like Rick,  I’ve learned  that the age\ndemographics  that stay with studios  the longest  are in the 45+ group.  In fact, this is the average  length\nof time members  stick with a studio  dependent  on age based  on our research:\n• 21 - 24 years  old: 3 months\n• 25 - 34 years  old: 7 months\n• 35 - 44 years  old: 11 months\n• 45+ years  old: 14 months+\nI hear many  studios  mention  they want  to find a way to appeal  to the younger  audience,  assuming\nthey’ll  be with them  longer.  I believe  this is purely  based  on the idea that they have a longer  remaining\ntime to  live.\nThe truth  is that younger  groups  like to experience  new things  and bounce  around.  The older  groups\nseem  to be more  attracted  to stability  and consistency.\nSince  Rick is going  after  an older  audience,  he knows  that when  he runs ads, the women  in his images\nand videos  need to look this way. They can’t  be 23 year old women  that look like they’re  preparing  to go\nto Cancun  for spring  break.  They need to look like the average  45+ year old, only with a happy,  positive\nattitude  while  working  out.\nThis not only goes for the main person  in the image  or video  but the people  in the background  as well.\nI remember I once had a fitness studio ask me to review their ads. They were trying to target women,\nand in the background of the ad image they were using, there were two men with their shirts off who\nwere also quite muscular. They wrongly assume that women might go to a studio just to check out the\ngood looking  guys,  but that isn’t the case.  Rather,  this can be very intimidating.  Once we switched out\nthose images for ones which included people more like their ideal audience members, we saw an\nincrease  in click-through  rate and decrease  in cost per lead.\nMy Offer\nThe offer  is usually  the most  important  factor  in getting  people  to respond  to my ads on platforms  like\nFacebook,  Instagram,  YouTube,  Google  Display,  Google  Ads, and Waze  (the platforms  we spend  the\nmost time on when  running  ads for our clients).  Whenever  an ad isn’t performing  as well,  I usually  look\nto adjust  the offer  before  anything  else.\nThere’s  a difference  in the narrative  I hear studio  owners  with little to no real sales training  say versus\nstudio  owners  that truly understand  and study  sales.\n| MI KE  AR CE 147\nIt goes like  this:\nStudio Owner WITHOUT Real Sales Training\n“I don’t  run free offers.  It devalues  our service  and attracts  tire kickers  and freeloaders.  I\nwant people  that are serious  about  working  out and can afford  our services.  Free offers\nallow  them  to have no skin in the game  and take everything  way less seriously.”\nStudio Owner WITH Real Sales Training\n“I don’t  care what you offer.  Just get bodies  in the door that live within  a few miles  of our\nstudio.  We’ll  take it from there.”\nSome  of you may be disagreeing  with this. If that’s  you, you’re  probably  in the group  that doesn’t  have\nand practice  real sales training.\nFree offers don’t devalue your service. They allow people to experience your service risk free. If your\nservice is as valuable as you say it is, people will want to buy it. Plain and simple.\nThe same  people  that “don’t  have money”,  according  to less skilled  salespeople,  usually  have a $1,000\nphone, a smart watch, and flat screen televisions in their houses. People will pay for what they want.\nThe question  is, do they want your program?\nEveryone wants to be in better shape. I don’t care who you are. I’m willing to bet that even Arnold\nSchwarzenegger in his prime would have wanted to have a little more muscle or a little less fat if he\ncould.\nEveryone  in your 5 mile radius  wants  to be in better  shape,  and mostly  everyone  in your area could\nafford  you if they just stopped  some  of the opposing  habits  that keep them  from having  excess  income,\nsuch as eating  out often,  eating  fast food,  drinking,  watching  Netflix,  etc. The question  is, are all of\nthose  places  better  at selling  to your prospect  than you? If so, then you have a sales problem.\nGetting  100 members  in 100 days takes  great  marketing  and also a strong  ability  to sell the leads  that\nthe marketing  drives.  Be sure to value  this part of your process.\nAlso, remember  this when  saying,  “I want  to target  people  that have money  and want  to get in better\nshape.”  People  with money  that want  anything  don’t  wait for an ad to make  them  an offer.  They just go\nget it.\nI have money,  and I have 2 gym memberships.  I can’t  imagine  any ad or any offer  that would  get me to\nmake  the effort  to go and check  out your studio  when  I’ve already  solved  my problem.  In fact, I don’t\neven think  I’d notice  your ad if it came  up on my feed because  it’s not a pain point  at all.\nHowever,  people  with little money  notice  the words  “free”,  and we already  know  everyone  wants  to be\nin better  shape.\nSo far, that all sounds like theory. So, let’s talk numbers.\nOn average,  fitness  studios  I work with that spend  $500 on ads generate  an average  of 90 leads  when\nrunning  a free week  offer.\nThe best paid offer  I run is the “30 for 30”, 30 days of studio  access  for $30. That paid offer  promoted\nwith the same  $500 ad budget  generates  around  30 leads.\n| MI KE  AR CE 148\nThe free offer  generates  3 times  as many  leads!  You may be thinking,  “but the paid leads  are better,\nright?”  Wrong.  It depends  on the skill set of the studio.\nThe most successful studios I’ve worked with rarely run paid offers. They almost exclusively run free\nweek offers and free session offers. Some have even offered 2 free weeks or even free month offers!\nWhy? All they care about  is getting  real bodies  in the door.  The more,  the better.  Once people  come  to a\nstudio,  they can get on a phone  or email  list, and the studio  can follow  up consistently.  They trust their\nsales process  and execution  very much.\nThose  that don’t  know  how to sell settle  for less leads,  and those  that are a bit further  down  the funnel.\nIt’s the only way they’ll  get business  - if they get lay downs.\nHere is a list of the top 7 most successful offers in order:\n• Free Week\n• Free Two Weeks\n• Free Session\n• Free 2 Sessions\n• 30 for  $30\n• 5 for $5\n• First Month  $39/mo!  $199/mo\nMY FUNNEL\nI use and love ClickFunnels. I run every single campaign with this incredible software.\nHere’s the way my funnel works:\nStep 1: Campaign\nI build  several  paid ad campaigns  on platforms  like Facebook,  Instagram,  YouTube,  Google  Display,  and\nWaze.  I categorize  them  by offers.  This means  each offer  has its own unique  campaign  and is titled  this\nway. Retargeting/remarketing  campaigns  will be separated  out as well.\nStep 2: Ad Set / Ad Group\nDepending  on my budget,  I will create  1 to 4 different  ad sets or ad groups  and break  them  up based  on\ntargeting.  If my studio  has a small  budget,  I will just run one ad set targeting,  such as females,  25-55\nyears  old that live within  5 miles  of the fitness  studio.  If my studio  has a larger  budget,  I will split up the\ntargeting  in pieces  and break  up the ad sets this way.\nNOTE:  I’ve learned  that targeting  females  converts  4x better  than targeting  to males.  This means  if I\nspend  $400 to generate  100 female  leads,  that same  campaign  and budget  would  only generate  about\n25 male leads.  I’m not going  to worry  about  having  a studio  filled  with only women.  Men will find their\nway in. Also, women  are more  likely  to bring  in spouses  and friends  than men are. I will definitely  notice\na higher  percentage  of female  members  if I only target  females,  however  I will hit my goals  much,  much\nfaster.  If I only have 100 days to gain 100 members,  this is a great  strategy.\n| MI KE  AR CE 149\nStep 3: Ads\nWithin each ad set, I will run at least 2 competing ads (A/B testing) to see which perform the best.\nWhen doing A/B testing, the competing ads will be identical with the exception of one variable. After\nspending about $50, I can begin to see wh ich version performs the best. Once that happens, I then\npause  the losing  ad, duplicate  the winning  ad, and change  a different  variable.  Then,  I rinse and repeat.\nExamples of variables that I will change are:\n• Headline\n• Copy\n• Image\n• Video\n• Description\n• CTA\n• Offer\n• Display  URL\nWhen writing the copy, I like to make sure I include the following:\n• Specificity\n• Scarcity\n• Exclusivity\n• Rarity\n• Popularity\n• Urgency\nHere’s an example of ad copy I might use:\n*** WOMEN IN SPRINGFIELD! ***\nHave you had enough  of NOT being  in the best shape  of your life? You’re  not alone,  as\nhundreds  of other  women  that live in Springfield  have,  too!\nABC Fitness is quickly becoming the most popular place to work out, scorch the fat\noff, and build lean muscle WITHOUT having to go on crazy diets and do tons of\ncardio.\nThis week,  we are giving  away a FREE WEEK  PASS to the first 50 Springfield  residents\nthat claim  the offer  to see how this workout  is getting  people  in shape  so quickly,  and\nin the most fun way imaginable.\nABC Fitness is the only studio of its kind to [fill in blank with something unique\nabout  my studio]  and now we want you to experience  the difference!\nThis offer  is on a first come  first serve  basis,  so hurry  while  offers  last!\n| MI KE  AR CE 150\nI have hundreds  of ad copy variations  that I’ll test and use depending  on the situation,  but this is a great\nexample  of a style that works  very well.\nStep 4: Landing Page\nThis is where ClickFunnels comes in. Every ad I run drives traffic to a ClickFunnels landing page.\nI don’t  like running  lead ads (although  they convert  decently  on the front end) because  I can’t  retarget\nthe same way. On ClickFunnels, I can place the tracking pixels I need to run the campaigns I want.     I\nalways place a Facebook and Google pixel on these landing pages so I can retarget on Facebook,\nInstagram, the Google Network, and YouTube. While you can retarget on Facebook  and Instagram  with\nlead ads, you leave a huge chunk out with the Google Network and YouTube. If I can learn who’s\ninterested on Facebook and Instagram and then target them for cheaper on YouTube and the Google\nNetwork,  I know  I can drive more  leads  for less cost.\nLike my ads, I have hundreds  of different  template  styles  we’ve  created  and use on ClickFunnels.\nGenerally,  they have a similar  format:\n1. There  is a logo in the header.\n2. The main banner  area has a video  on the left and an offer  on the right.\n3. Below  the video  there  is a written  testimonial  or two from existing  members.\n4. There  is a countdown  timer  below  the form that is set for 1 week.  (I have a reminder\nsent in my internal  system  to remind  me to go into the form and reset  the timer\neach week.)\n5. Next, there is a section with columns. Each column highlights 3 things that\nregistrants  will get with their free week,  such as unlimited  classes,  body fat test and\nmeasurements,  or a free meal plan builder.\n6. There is a section below the columns with some “before / after” photos or more\ntestimonials.\n7. A paragraph is usually added to explain the offer better as well as describe  the\nstudio  and why it’s so awesome.\n8. Finally,  there  will be a call to action  (CTA)  again  at the end of the page.\nAlthough  there  are things  I will add when  it makes  sense,  that’s  the general  structure  of the content  on\nthe landing  page.\nPlease  note,  I do not try to sell the studio.  I sell the offer.  It is too early  in the funnel  to get leads  to buy\ninto the entire  thing.  All I need them  to do right now is claim  the offer  so my sales team  can get them  in.\nOnce  they are in, THAT  is when  we sell the studio  and get them  on a membership.\nLanding pages with videos do convert better, so I will make sure to get one whenever possible. If a\nstudio I work with doesn’t have one, our studio hires a fitness model that we use regularly to stand  in\nfront of a green screen and shoot a video using a script on a teleprompter. Again, this video is only\nselling the  offer.\n| MI KE  AR CE 151\nOn the landing  page form,  I ask for the lead’s  first name,  last name,  email,  and phone  number.  The CTA\nis usually  something  like:\nClaim Offer\nYes, I Want  a Free Week  Pass!\nNext Step  >\nThe section  with the 3 columns  that detail  3 things  leads  will get with their offer  will have a title,  image,\nand description  in each column.\nI generally  will use the exact  same  color  scheme  throughout  the landing  page.  I will use two main colors\nand a third color  JUST for the CTA buttons  so they stand  out.\nFor example,  if my company’s  colors  are red, white,  and blue,  I would  use white  as the main color,  blue\nfor all accent  colors,  and then red only for the CTA buttons.  When  doing  this, it’s good to be conscious\nof the videos  and images.  I will do my best to not have red elsewhere  on the page so the buttons  truly\ndo stand  out as best as possible.\nAt the bottom  of the landing  page,  I will also display  the contact  information  and address  of my fitness\nstudio.\nStep 5: The Automated Actions That Follow\nOnce someone lands on the landing page, they are automatically placed into custom audiences on\nFacebook and Google since I’ve placed pixels on these pages.\nOnce someone fills out the form, there are quite a few actions that take place after this.\nA Text a nd an Email Gets Sent to the Prospect\nThe email  is essentially  the same  copy as the text, only longer  and more  detailed.  Ultimately,  the goal is\nto introduce  myself,  congratulate  them  on claiming  the offer,  and get them  to schedule  their first class.\nSometimes I will place a link to a scheduler where prospects can schedule themselves. This takes much\nless work off my (the studio owner’s) plate, but it unfortunately does result in fewer book rates and\nshow rates than if a call was done.  Usually  I’ll only automate  the scheduling  if I am already  close  to\ncapacity and have more members than time right now. If my studio is starving for business, I ask the\nlead for the best time to get on the phone and schedule their first class. If I only have 100 day s to get\n100 members,  this is the strategy  I recommend  and would  follow.\nA Text and an Email  Gets Sent to Me, the Studio  Owner  (And/Or  Sales  Reps  or Whoever  Can\nMake  the Phone  Call and Schedule)\nI don’t  recommend  waiting  for the lead to reply  to the text or call in. My most successful  studios  call\nleads  within  a minute  or two of their opt-in. In fact, there’s  a study  by MIT that proves  form leads  have\na 900x greater  contact  rate when  calling  within  the first 5 minutes.  I’ve also noticed  that 92% of my\ndigital  traffic  this year has come  from mobile  sources,  so if I call within  a few minutes  of the opt-in,\nwhere  do you think  their phone  still is? Yep…  in their hands.  Call them  ASAP!\n| MI KE  AR CE 152\nThe Lead Will Shift Custom Audiences (Sometimes)\nIf my studio  has a larger  budget,  I will switch  the custom  audience  which  the lead belongs  to and run\nmore  unique  campaigns  to them.  Rather  than having  these  ads encourage  them  to take the offer,  these\nremarketing campaigns will show testimonial videos and proof as to how great my studio  concept\nreally  is!\nThe Lead Will Be Taken to a “Thank You” Page\nThis thank you page thanks them for claiming their offer while also showing a BONUS offer. The bon us\noffer is usually  something  like an additional  free week,  free barre  socks,  free t-shirt,  or 5 free passes  for\nfriends  which  they will receive  only if they call in before  the offer expires.  Then,  I would  have a countdown\ntimer  going  backwards  from about  7 minutes  or so. Below  the timer  I would  show the phone  number  on\na button  that’s  clickable  so if the lead is on their phone,  it will allow  them  to easily  make  the call. Below\nthat, I will show more  testimonials,  before/after  photos,  and case study  videos,  if available.\nStep 6: Email and Text Campaigns\nThat first email  and text which  goes out to the lead isn’t the last of them.  I’ll also continuously  send\nthem  more  correspondence  until they opt out or come  into my studio.  Each one gets more  urgent  than\nthe last as the deal expires.  It’s a 7-day campaign,  and on the last day, a message  explains  that it is the\nlast day to claim  this offer  (so they must schedule  fast)!\nThe Numbers\nOn average, these are the lead costs that I should expect to see:\n• Facebook  - around  $5 - $35 Cost Per Lead (CPL)\n• Instagram  - around  $10 - $50 CPL\n• Instagram  Stories  - around  $1 - $7 CPL\n• YouTube  - around  $25 - $65 CPL\nI strongly suggest focusing on Facebook and Instagram Stories, with Instagram feed ads working\nbetter  generally  for retargeting  campaigns  only. There’s  a lower  CPL on Instagram  feed ads if used for\nretargeting.\nMy goal would  be to drive  at least 1,000  leads  inside  of the first 75 days so that I could  have the remaining\n25 days to close  the leads  that came  in on Day 75.\nI say 1,000  leads  because  the average  studio  I work with converts  about  10% of their overall  digital\nleads  into members.  My best studio  clients  convert  around  30 - 40%, but let’s assume  my studio  is\naverage  for this scenario.\nI would  prepare  to have an ad budget  of about  $15,000  over this 75 day period.  At $15 assumed  overall\nCPL, that should  generate  1,000  leads.  That 1,000  leads  should  result  in at least 100 new members\nwith 900 prospects  on my list to continuously  follow  up with after  the campaign,  which  will probably\ngenerate  another  100 members  over the next 3 months  with really  good follow  up.\nThe average fitness studio I work with charges about $150/month with a retention rate of about 7\n| MI KE  AR CE 153\nmonths.  That means  their minimum  lifetime  customer  value  (LCV)  is $1,050.  I say minimum  because\nmany  of my studio  clients  generate  revenue  from ancillary  sales such as retail,  supplements,  and gear.\nIt also doesn’t  include  sign-ups from the new customers’  friends  (which  will inevitably  happen  with\nquite  a few of my new members).\nThis means  that those  100 new members  should  be valued  at a minimum  $105,000  to my business.\nNot a bad trade  for $15,000  in ads (7x ROI).\nIn fact, I’ll be profitable almost immediately, as 100 new members that pay me $150 per month puts\nme at a $15,000 monthly recurring revenue (MRR). I’ll end the campaign at break even and every\nmonth I hang onto even just one member, that makes me profitab le by that much.\nMy most successful studio owner clients, such as Matt Kafora who owns 7 Orangetheory franchise\nlocations, run a 3 -4 month presale campaign before opening his doors and budgets $10,000 per\nmonth during that presale period.\nSounds like a lot , right?\nWell,  Matt has opened  every  one of his fitness  studios  with over 500 members  and has opened  one of\nthem  with over 800 members!  Think  about  what  that ROI is for you?\nClosing Thoughts\nClickFunnels  has been the core of every  marketing  campaign  I’ve built.  All traffic  runs to their landing\npages,  and all automated  activities  stem from these  landing  pages.\nI can’t imagine having the success we’ve had if it wasn’t for ClickFunnels.\nIf you’re  doubtful  about  this campaign  and funnel  working,  just know  that I’ve had almost  2,000  fitness\nstudios  successfully  run this model.\n| B R I C K & MOR TAR F U N N E L  S 154\nRyan  D. Lee & Bradley  Gibb\nFounders of CashFlow  Tactics\nRyan and Brad came  from the world  of traditional  finance.  They\nboth obtained  degrees  and landed  in the corporate  world.  Ryan\nwas an executive  at a Fortune  500 company,  and Brad spent  time\non Wall Street  as well as owning  his own business.

Eventually  they developed  a strategy  that\nallowed  them  to walk away from their careers  a few short  years\nlater. Now, they help others  achieve  their own financial  freedom\nand feel completely  empowered  with money.\nCashFlowTactics.com\n| R YAN D . LEE & BR ADLE  Y GIBB  155\nThe “Top Grade”  Method  For Exploding\nYour Business in Record  Time\nWe’re  excited  to share  our story and tell what we would  do if we needed  to generate  100 new clients  in\n100 days.  For my business  partner  Ryan and I, that’s  not a hypothetical  situation.  It’s what we actually\ndid when  we first joined  Russell  Brunson’s  Inner  Circle.\nBefore  we give our advice  on what  we would  do to create  100 clients  in 100 days,  we’d like to share  a\nbit about  our story,  the story  of how ClickFunnels  empowered  us to transform  our business  and lead a\nmovement.\nThe key for us was learning  to leverage  our existing  client  base in a non-traditional  way. That’s  what we\nwould  do to create  100 clients.  That’s  our story.\nThis is the truth behind how we earned a 2 Comma Club award by ignoring 97% of the advice we were\ngiven about marketing.\nTaking the Leap\nIf you’ve  ever asked  yourself  the question,“does  this whole  ClickFunnels  internet  marketing  thing  really\nwork?”  Then all you have to do is look at our personal  experience  to know  that it does.\nWe went from paying  the shipping  cost of a “free”  book (later  we found  out this technique  has a name:\na free + shipping funnel) to writing a $25,000 check to someone (Russell) we only learned existed three\nweeks  earlier.\nIf we’re  crazy  enough  to do that (or if Russell  is that good of a marketer)  then you can do it in your\nbusiness,  too.\nIt all started when we found ourselves stuck in an impossible spot.\nOver the past four years or so, we have built a successful financial services practice. While we used\nsome  modern  tools that differentiated  us in the marketplace,  we still ultimately  had a very traditional\npractice,  marked  by one-to-one client  selling,  inconsistent  leads  and an overall  lack of control.\nWe Were Slaves in Our Own Business\nBefore we discovered ClickFunnels, we were “successful.” Our business was growing. We had leads.  We\nmade  money,  but we still felt trapped.  We were slaves  in our business,  no matter  how much  money  we\nmade,  because  of one simple  fact: we did not control  our lead flow.\nThe financial  services  industry,  and if you are reading  this then your business  also, has always  lived and\ndied by referrals  or by “dial and smile”  cold calling  lists to drum  up business.\n| R YAN D . LEE & BR ADLE  Y GIBB  156\nHere is one major  reason  why: As a financial  adviser,  you can’t  compete  on product.  The product  is\nregulated  and created  by somebody  else, so what  you offer  is the same  as what  everybody  else offers.\nIn order to compete, you are forced to figure out what additional things you can offer to your clients.\nWe were spending all our time, effort, and energy to provide extras to pull people in so they chose us\ninstead of the other guy.\nEven if you manage  to remain  successful,  like we did, the leads  always  come  as feast  or famine.  You\ndon’t  know  when  your next client  will come  along,  so you are forced  to take them  when  they appear.\nThat’s  where  we found  ourselves.  We had little  control  over our time,  no control  over our hours,  and\nworse,  zero control  over the type of person  we were speaking  to. This meant  we often  found  ourselves\nmeeting  with people  that we weren’t  really  excited  about  meeting  or who didn’t  actually  qualify  for the\ntype of services  we offered.\nAt the time,  we were part of a marketing  partnership  that provided  us leads,  and we closed  the business.\nThis worked  great  until the quality  or frequency  of the leads  would  fluctuate  or we just wanted  to start\nworking  with a different  type of clientele.\nWe had also established  a healthy  influx  of referrals,  but that comes  with its own set of problems.  When\nwe did that,  our time was never  our own.\nAny time a client  decided  to refer a family  member,  friend,  or business  partner,  we had to put everything\nelse on hold and respond. It didn’t really matter what else we were doing because we had to “strike\nwhile  the iron was hot.”\nWe had to immediately  clear  our calendar  and engage  with the new lead or risk missing  the window  of\ninterest  and opportunity  placed  before  us.\nIn short,  we had to run a business  being  Johnny -on-the-Spot for anyone  our clients  sent our way. What\nwas worse  was that we had even less control  over the quality  of our clients,  since,  out of respect  to our\ncurrent  clients,  we had to work with whatever  friends  and family  they sent our way.\nIf You Control the Rain, You Control the Game\nI still clearly  remember  the day Ryan and I decided  we were done.  We were in yet another  meeting  to\ndiscuss  lead quality,  lead allocation,  and compensation  with the group  with whom  we partnered.\nTensions  were high.  I was red in the face,  pounding  my fists on the table.  I was doing  everything  we\ncould  to hold back a steam  of swear  words  and maintain  some  semblance  of civility  in the discussions.\nSuddenly,  it hit me (and I literally  almost  laughed  out loud when  it did.) I realized  we had exactly  zero\nleverage in the conversation because they controlled the leads.\nWe were excellent closers (1 and 2 in the company that year). We were leaders and mentors in the\npractice,  and we helped  create  the majority  of the internal  training  and external  content.  None of that\nmattered.  We were 100% expendable  because  they controlled  the one thing  that mattered.  The leads.\nThat was the day we realized that if we didn’t learn to generate our own leads, we would be forever\ntrapped one way or another in our business.\nWe had to control the rain.\n| R YAN D . LEE & BR ADLE  Y GIBB  157\nDown the Ra bbit Hole (Advertising vs. Marketing)\nOnce  we realized  where  we had to grow,  we focused  a lot of energy  and money  on our goal.  We spent\nthousands  of dollars  learning  how to “advertise.”  The truth  was we threw  a bunch  of cash at people\nhoping  they would  magically  make  all our problems  go away.\nAfter  licking  our wounds,  we decided  to take our business  online  and sank $50,000  on a web developer\nand a marketing  firm with a big reputation  in other  industries.  After  8 months  working  with us in our\nindustry,  they provided  little  to no measurable  results.\nWe learned  (painfully)  that we were going  to need much  more  than a website,  blog and a few inspirational\nquotes  on our Facebook  page.\nThe results  were not what we were expecting.  We started  to feel stuck.  Anytime  we came  up with a new\nidea (which  was often  as we are idea guys),  we had to go back to the marketing  firm, pay more  money,\nand wait for two or three  weeks  for them  to implement  it.\nIt wasn’t working, so we started to tell ourselves that this couldn’t work for our industry, that online\nmarketing was for other things like weight loss formulas, supplements, transformational gurus, and\n[insert other product  here].\nWe had never  seen anyth ing like online  marketing  work for the financial  services  industry.  After  all, we\nwere dealing  with people’s  money,  retirement  accounts,  and livelihoods.  Maybe  it just couldn’t  work in\nthat space,  right?\nOf course, we were wrong (thankfully).\nWe didn’t understand that advertising is not the same thing as marketing.\nEverything changed for us when a friend of ours who was a marketer for a financial newsletter\nrecommended  we pick up the book DotComSecrets  by Russell  Brunson.  We looked  into it and figured\nwe didn’t  have anything  to lose. It was free after  all. All we had to do was cover  the shipping  cost.\nWe decided, “What the heck, let’s see what the guy has to say.”\nWe ordered  one copy to share,  and Ryan took the first crack  at it. After  reading  the whole  book in just\ntwo days,  he booked  tickets  to FunnelHacking  Live 2016 along  with our hotel  and airfare  without  even\ntelling  me about  the plans.\nSince  the event  was just a couple  of days away,  I didn’t  actually  get my hands  on the book until we were\nboarding  the plane  to San Diego.\nAfter  a whirlwind  three  days,  and the most intense  marketing  event  we’d ever attended  (ok, it was also\nthe only marketing event we’d ever attended, but it still holds the top spot for the most intense even\nafter years  of attending  other  events),  Russell  pitched  his Inner  Circle  for $25,000.\n$25,000? Are you kidding?  We passed.\nStill, one phrase  stuck  with us after  we left the event.  Russell  said the purpose  of the group  was not\nnecessarily  to make  me a better  marketer.  Plenty  of other  masterminds  could  do that.\nInstead,  his goal was to condense  ten years  of experience  into a single  year for everyone  who joined.  The\ninitial  sticker  shock  kept our wallets  closed,  but we could  not shake  that idea of a decade  of knowledge\nin just a  year.\n| R YAN D . LEE & BR ADLE  Y GIBB  158\nWhen we got back to Salt Lake City, I went to bed, not planning to think any more about it. The same\nnight, I woke up at 2:00 a.m. with Russell’s words in my head. Ten years of experience.\nI dug through  my backpack,  found  the URL in the offer form and filled out the application  to the Inner\nCircle.  Two days later we were on a call with Russell’s  team,  hoping  we would  be accepted  so we could\ngive them  our credit  card number.\nThe Decade in a Day  Call\nAfter signing up, our first interaction with Russell was our “Decade in a Day” call.\nThis is when all our hopes and dreams were crushed in an instant, but it was also when a much better\nand brighter vision opened up for us.\nWe entered the call thinking this was when Russell would show his marketing Jiu Jitsu tricks with this\nsoftware thing  called  ClickFunnels.  Then,  we’d have so many  leads  we’d have clients  for life. After  all,\nthat’s  what we’d just paid $25,000  for, right?\nThe call started  with,  “Tell me about  what you guys do. What  clients  do you work with?”\nWe said, “anyone  with money.”\n“Ok, cool.  What  do you do for them?”\nWe said (ever  so humbly),  “everything.”\nRussell said, “Uhhh, ok. Well, this is easy. You guys are dead in the water.”\nTalk about  a dagger  in the heart.  This was the guy who had wooed  and impressed  us so much  that\nafter  buying  a “free”  book,  we spent  thousands  on his courses  and events  and then wrote  a check  for\n$25,000, and he was saying that we were already done for.\nThat’s not what we were expecting to hear. After we stuttered a bit we finally got out our next words.\n“Well,  ok, what  do you mean  ‘dead  in the water?’  We have something  every one needs,  and we can do\neverything  a person  needs.  Our market  should  be unlimited.  You’re  supposed  to show  us how to use\nClickFunnels  to bring  all those  people  right to our door.”\nRussell replied, “well guys, the honest truth is that if you are going to be everything to everyone it\nmeans you’ll have nothing to actually say, and you’ll drown in all the noise of everyone else.”\nThis was lesson  number  one: we had to be different.  We had to find what we stood  for in order  to stand\napart.  We had to focus  on more  than a business.  We had to learn  to lead a movement.\nThat conversation started a new path for us. We dedicated ourselves to learning from Russell and\neveryone  at ClickFunnels.  Whatever  he said to do, we did. It worked.  Within  two years,  we hit the Two\nComma  Club.\nClickFunnels gave us great tools:\n• a simple  method  for communicating  with our entire  customer  list,\n• a place  to create  branded  course  material  instead  of emailing  disorganized  YouTube\nvideos,  and\n| R YAN D . LEE & BR ADLE  Y GIBB  159\n• an easy way for our customers to share referrals with friends, allowing them  to\naccess  webinars  and useful  information  so we didn’t  have to go back to the Johnny -\non-the-Spot game.\nBut the truth  is, ClickFunnels  did a lot more  than that for us. It changed  our mindset,  which  in turn\nchanged  the entire  trajectory  of our business.  Russell  taught  us processes  and strategies  that allowed\nus to reach  a place  with our business  that seemed  impossible  before.\nThat’s  why we are excited  to share  our ideas  around  what  we would  do to generate  100 new clients  for\nour existing  business,  using  only our Clickfunnels  account:  because  that is the exact  situation  we faced\nthree years  ago.\nWhen we joined the Inner Circle, we had to cut all previous ties with our existing sources for creating\nnew clients.  This was do or die for us. We were all in, and we had to learn  how to create  our own clients\nbefore  we ran out of time and money.\nThe Hidden Benefit in Your ClickFunnels Account\nClickFunnels  isn’t magic.  It’s an excellent  system  with great  tools and processes  for launching  your\nproduct.  However,  for us, connecting  with Russell  and the community  opened  our minds  and opened\nthe doors  to many  possibilities.\nWe had to relearn  and rethink  a lot about  business.  We entered  the Inner  Circle  with just over 1,000\nclients,  not bad by any means,  but we were still searching  for control  and consistency.\nThe lessons  we learned  and the way that our mindset  and approach  to our business  changed  allowed\nus to shift the entire  way we were going  about  finding  clients.\nThe Best Customer Is One You Already  Have\nOur deep fear after  joining  the Funnel  Hacker  community  was that the world  of clickbaity,  attention -\ngrabbing  marketing  would  not work for us in financial  services.  My potential  clients  were not looking\nfor teasers  or lead magnets;  they wanted  real value.\nYet, the truth  is that we were out of options.  We had doubts  about  ClickFunnels,  but we knew  it couldn’t\nbe any worse  than what we were already  doing,  which  just wasn’t  working.\nWe came  in ready  to give it our all. In our first Inner  Circle  meeting,  we geared  up to launch  a webinar,\nsell a $1,000  product,  and find a new customer  base.\nAfter  the first day ended,  Garrett  J. White  (a member  of the Inner  Circle  at the time)  pulled  us aside\nand said, “What  are you guys doing?  Why are you trying  to sell this $1,000  product?  You already  have\nover 1,000  clients.  When  was the last time you talked  to the 1,000  people  you have that have given  you\nmillions  of dollars  already?”\nThat was our first major epiphany. We were putting our focus in the wrong place. Instead of trying to\ndrum up new clients with whom we had to build trust, prove our value over their current adviser, and\nclose on the prospect of working with us, we needed to start with our existing client list.\nBefore you jump into the world of internet marketing and get all excited about selling digital courses\n| R YAN D . LEE & BR ADLE  Y GIBB  160\nand making  millions  with (relatively)  little work,  understand  this: The best customer  is a customer  you\nalready  have.\nRussell  says all the time to “pick  up the pile of money  in front of you” before moving  on to other  shiny\nobjects.\nYour existing  client  base already  knows  and trusts  you. You already  put in the work to attract  them.\nThey are primed  to buy from you again.  You are leaving  millions  on the table  by looking  outside  of your\nbase and failing  to offer  “the next thing”  to your existing  clients.\nIf we woke  up tomorrow  needing  to get 100 clients,  we wouldn’t  waste  time finding  cold traffic  (people\nwho have no idea who we are, have no reason  to trust us, and have no intention  of buying  from us) to\ntry to create  new clients.  We would  find the 100 clients  in our existing  list.\nHere are the exact steps we would take to leverage our existing customer list and get 100 clients.\nOUR STEPS TO GETTING 100 NEW CLIENTS\nStep 1: Top Grade Our Customer List\nOur very first step to creating  100 clients  would  be to pull our existing  list of customers  and “top grade”\nour clients  based  on the value  they already  provided  to our business.  That’s  exactly  what  we did after\nthat 2 hour conversation  with Garrett  J. White  at our first Inner  Circle  meeting.\nIt was a major  lesson  for us. Before  that, our assumption  was, “If we already  worked  with these  clients\nfor years  and helped  them  implement  so much,  they were the highest  paying  clients.”  We didn’t  see any\nreason  to focus  our marketing  efforts  there.\nWe just didn’t  realize  how much  value  we were missing  out on by thinking  that way. Those  that have\nalready  invested  the most with us, and who have already  received  the most value  from us are the exact\nclients  that have the most potential  to add future  revenue.\nStep 2: Analyze Our List\nAfter  we top grade  our list, we want  to look for natural  segmentation.  When  we did this, we discovered\nthat our youngest customers had provided the lowest amount of value. They’d given us the least\namount  of money  in the past.  Our middle -aged clients  had given  us the most value,  and our oldest\nclients  fell in the middle.\nWe needed  to find our most valuable  clients,  and we did this by looking  for patterns  and similarities.\nWe followed  the Pareto  principle  of 80/20:  the idea that,  generally,  80% of a business’  revenue  comes\nfrom 20% of that business’  clients.  This means  that,  often,  the bottom  80% of clients  can actually  be\nignored .\nIt’s the top 20% that have the potential  to generate  the next 80% of revenue,  the same  way they\ngenerated  the last 80%.\nAfter  all, we only have 100 days to generate  100 new leads,  so we don’t  have time to waste  80% worth\nof time and effort  on clients  that generated  only 20% of our previous  revenue.\n| R YAN D . LEE & BR ADLE  Y GIBB  161\nStep 3: Figure Out Where Our Clients Are Going\nNow that we’ve  identified  a segment  within  our clients,  it’s time to get to know  more  about  this group\nof clients  by asking  ourselves  one question:  “where  are they wanting  to go?”\nJust like the Cheshire  Cat told Alice that it didn’t  matter  which  way she went if she didn’t  know  where\nshe wanted to be headed, it doesn’t matter what you offer your clients if you don’t know what they\nwant next or where  they are headed  on their journey.\nSo, rather  than jumping  in to make  a new landing  page or split test a headline  or throw  together  a new\nlead magnet,  we needed  to take a moment  and put ourselves  in our clients’  minds.\nThinking about the top 20% of our clients, we asked ourselves:\n• What  do they want?\n• Where  are they going?\n• What  do they need next?\nThose answers will become “the next thing” we can offer them to turn them into our next 100 clients.\nThis is how we were able to be successful.  We were able to identify  what  our clients  would  need next\nand offer  it to our existing  list (and in the process,  earn the 2 Comma  Club award  for generating  over\n$1,000,000 using ClickFunnels.)\nThe first part of this was asking those questions and really delving into the mind of our clients. We\nformulated  a very clear idea of what our clients’  needs,  problems,  and obstacles  were.  From there,  we\nneeded to gather  data.\nThis can be done through  an ask campaign  or individual  client  interviews.  We ended  up doing  a modified\nask campaign.  This was tricky  in our industry  because,  as a financial  adviser,  your clients  are paying  you\nto know  everything.  We couldn’t  just go to them  and start asking  questions  that made  it seem  like we\ndidn’t  know  what  solutions  to offer,  so we used the knowledge  of our customer  base,  asked  ourselves\nthose  three  questions,  and formed  a solid idea of what  we hypothesized  “the next thing”  might  be.\nThen, we sent out emails with information about topics we thought could lead to that next thing and\nmonitored the responses. We basically implemented direct response marketing techniques. We’d tell\npart of a story then say, “If you want to know  the outcome  of this, just email  us back and let us know.”\nThe topics  that got the best information  and the most responses  lead us to our “next  thing.”\nWhen  we figured  out where  our clients  were going,  we could  give them  a map and provide  solutions\nthat they didn’t  even know  they needed.\nStep 4: Add Value First, Then Sell\n“Nobody likes to be sold to, but everyone loves to buy.” - Dr. Earl Taylor\nAs financial  advisers  in an industry  where  huge amounts  of trust are required,  we needed  to offer true\nvalue  before  we jumped  in and started  selling.  Too many  people  try to hit the hard sell early.  We have\ncome  really  far in understanding  sales psychology,  and yet so many  businesses  are still acting  like used\ncar salesmen  from the 1950’s.\n| R YAN D . LEE & BR ADLE  Y GIBB  162\nInstead  of bombarding  potential  clients  with sales messages  right out of the gate,  we needed  to create\nvalue  first.  When  we create  true value  for our clients,  they not only purchase  from us, but they also\nbring in  others.\nWe let our clients be our best salespeople. Whatever problems they have, their friends, peers, and\ncolleagues  are likely  to have,  too. If we can solve  it for our client,  we can solve  it for others  in their same\nspace  because  they are likely  all on the same  journey.\nIf we can form a good relationship  with our clients,  create  value  for them,  and show them  the problem\nthey are going  to face next and how we can solve it for them,  they will choose  us every  time and make\nsure that everybody they know hears about us. Our marketing reach will grow like wildfire with little\nadditional  effort.\nClickFunnels  allows  us to do this simply  and efficiently.  Here are some  tactics  we use with ClickFunnels\nto add value  and nurture  a strong  relationship  with our clients  so that they will want  to buy from us\nwhen  they are ready  to make  a purchase.\nCreate Content\nProviding  our clients  with high-quality  content  reinforces the idea of us as a trustworthy  authority.  We\nwant to establish  ourselves  as true thought  leaders  and strengthen  the relationship  with our clients  by\nproviding  education  and value  in our content  before  we try to sell.\nWhen  we started  with ClickFunnels,  we created  a 4-part video  series,  a course,  and a panel  of experts.\nWhen  we analyzed  our client  list and realized  that our most valuable  clientele  were people  in their late\n40s and early 50s, we discovered  that the most pressing  questions  for them  included:\n• How does everything  I’ve accumulated  actually  turn into retirement  income?\n• How do I incorporate  all of my other  assets  into a comprehensive  income  strategy?\nTo serve  this segment  of our audience  with value,  we put together  a video  series  on how to create  10-\n40% more  income  in retirement.\nThis addressed their next biggest questions, gave true actionable value, and built trust and connection.\nForm a Membership  Site\nNext,  we created  a membership  site within  ClickFunnels.  This allows  us to control  which  of our clients\nhave access  to specific  content  based  on their membership  level with our company.\nIt took us a couple of Friday afternoons to create the content (and for most of it we just compiled a\nlot of what we had already  done),  then a few hours  to put it all into the software.  We decided  to pay a\nfreelancer  a few hundred  bucks  to make  it look clean  and professional,  but if either  of us had any innate\ndesign  sense,  it wouldn’t  have taken  much  time to do that on our own.\nWith ClickFunnels, it is possible to schedule content to drip out to members daily, weekly, or monthly\nto ensure  that value  is consistently  added  and trust is continually  built.\nHost a Webinar\nWe also hosted a live webinar using ClickFunnels. This continu es to show us as a knowledgeable\n| R YAN D . LEE & BR ADLE  Y GIBB  163\nauthority in our field while building the value that our clients want.\nThe reason we did it live is that a live webinar allows for a question and answer session following a\npresentation, which promotes the interaction and community spirit we wanted to establish with our\nbase. Live webinars can be recorded for playback for fut ure clients as well so that they get access to\nthe same valuable  information.\nEstablish  a Referral  Program\nReferrals  are vital for keeping  our business  growing.  We want  our clients  to do our marketing  and selling\nfor us, so we’re  constantly  expanding  our reach  based  on our initial  marketing  efforts.\nIn traditional marketing, referrals are key, but they also cause issues. They lead back to that Johnny -\non-the-Spot problem,  where  we are forced  to drop everything  to cater  to the potential  client . We were\ninvesting  time in educating  and engaging  with the client,  who might  not even be the right type of client\nfor our business.  Plus, when  people  don’t  refer others,  our business  growth  suffers.  We’re  at the mercy\nof other  people  choosing  to take action  that they might  not ever take.\nWith ClickFunnels, we set up a referral program that does the work for us as well as gives us multiple\nbenefits.  It allows  us to easily  share  the educational  material  we already  put together.  There  is no more\ndropping everything and having conversations that might lead nowhere. Instead, we provide the  same\nawesome  content  that our tribe already  received.\nThe other major benefit of a referral program is that it drives our clients to action. Instead of waiting\naround and hoping our clients refer people, we can get in front of them and inspire them to do so. We\ncan even offer incentives like status increases in your membership model. Exclusivity and status are\nmajor  drives  for people.  This will motivate  our current  clients  to spread  the word and motivate  others\nto join the exclusive  community  we have created.\n***\nThose  are the actionable  steps  we would  take to create  100 clients.  It worked  for us, and it absolutely\ncan work for you. If you are ready  to take those  steps,  though,  and you really  want  to grow and be\nsuccessful,  you need to go beyond  that.\nWe’re  going  to share  with you the actions  you need to take in order  to expand  your value  for your clients\nin an even bigger  way.\nHow to Rise Above and Add Even More Value\nIf you are ready  to embrace  that challenge  and move  your business  in an upward  trajectory,  you need\nto understand  the problems  you face where  you are now.\nAs we tried growing  our business  traditionally,  there  were three  main areas  that stood  in the way of our\ngrowth and  profitability.\n| R YAN D . LEE & BR ADLE  Y GIBB  164\n3 THINGS PREVENTING OUR GROWTH AND PROFITABILITY\n1. Time Wasted on Education / Low Close Percentage\nThe biggest cost to our business was meeting with potential clients that did not end up doing  business\nwith us. We were putting direct time and effort into trying to educate every potential client with  zero\nway to figure  out whether  it was going  to be a huge waste.\nAnother  major  cost to our business  was spending  more  time with clients  than necessary.  The more\ntime we spent  with a client,  the less money  we made.  (This sounds  harsh,  like we don’t  want  to spend\ntime serving  the clients.  That’s  not what  we’re  talking  about  here.)\nLet’s say we spend  10 hours  helping  Bill and Mary,  and we are able to answer  all their questions.  We get\nthem  the information  they need and help them  take actions  to move  toward  their goals.  But, we spend\nonly 5 hours doing the same with John and Sara. The second situation is obviously more desirable,\nright?  We want to offer value,  but we want to offer it efficiently.\n2. Clients Not Bringing in Referrals\nWhen we were trying traditional marketing methods, referrals built our business. This could be good,\nwhen there was a steady flow, but when there wasn’t, it made things very difficult.\nIdeally every one of our customers would have been bringing in more bus iness through referrals.\nUnfortunately,  it didn’t  always  work that way. When  clients  didn’t  bring  in referrals,  their value  to our\nbusiness  dropped  and kept us from expanding  the way we wanted  to.\n3. Low Commitment Level / Shopping Around\nSinking  in time with potential  clients  that would  not commit  or were just shopping  around  to get the\nbest price  was a major  barrier  to our business  expansion  and growth.\nWe weren’t  taking  advantage  of the situation  right in front of us. Those  clients  were ready,  willing,  and\nable to spend money on services we offered, but we weren’t offering them the “next thing.” We were\nfailing to have conversations that would have cut through the noise of our competition and made sure\nthey wanted  us as the solution  to their problems.\nThey were going  to spend  that money  somewhere,  but we didn’t  position  ourselves  in the right way to\nbe the clear  answer.  We were just caught  up in that cycle  of trying  to offer  more  and more  of ourselves,\nwithout  having  the right conversations  with them  in order  to give them  the answers  they needed  in the\nfuture.\nThat’s  how many  financial  advisers  become  overwhelmed  and stuck.  They just pile on extra  in hopes  of\nstanding  apart  from the crowd,  but instead,  they just get lost in the sea of options.\nThat’s  another  reason  why it’s better  to look within  your existing  client  list rather  than searching  for new\nbuyers;  you already  have trust and connection  which  gives  you leverage.  When  you take that connection\nand trust and leverage  it with an opportunity  designed  to offer new solutions,  an opportunity  your\nclients  don’t  want  to say no to, you get an upper  hand you didn’t  have before.  That allows  you to stop\ncompeting.\n| R YAN D . LEE & BR ADLE  Y GIBB  165\nFind Your “One Thing”\nIf you want  to grow beyond  where  you have been,  you can’t  do what  you’ve  always  done.  You have to\nchange  your mindset  and outlook.\nOne of the most important  major  changes  you can make  is to stop trying  to be everything  to everyone.\nThis is one of the most valuable  lessons  we learned  from Russell  and everyone  at ClickFunnels.  It was\na game -changer  for us. It’s how we found  our value,  our voice,  and our future.\nJust as Russell  told us in our first call with him, “When  you try to offer  everything,  you might  as well not\nbe saying  anything.  You just get lost in the noise.  If you try to be a one-stop-shop,  you’re  just floundering\nin the sea of options.”\nInstead, you need to find the “one thing” that you can offer that will set you apart so you can pierce\nthrough all the  noise.\nIt can be scary to do this. You think you are closing yourself off, saying no to legitimate streams of\nbusiness, but what you are really doing is positioning yourself more effectively in the marketplace.\nOnce you find that thing, the thing that will make s ure you get heard and allow you to build a loyal\nclient base, you can (and should) start to offer more. Don’t think of it as closing yourself off, but as\nstrategically positioning yourself now so you can offer more value in the future.\nSo how do you pierce  the market? How do you make sure you are relevant and heard? You need to\nfocus on the 3 M’s: master, message, and market.\nFOCUS ON THE 3 M’s\nBecome the MASTER\nWhen  we were just competing  in the financial  services  space,  we had no way to truly stand  out. Nothing\nabout  our business  truly made  us special  or different.  At the end of the day, we were providing  the\nsame  products  and services  everyone  else was providing.\nAfter  we joined  the Inner  Circle,  though,  we learned  that we needed  to step up and show that we had\nsomething more to offer. We did this by becoming true thought leaders in our industry, giving value\nand education to our clients. Instead of just offering a product, we started wrapping our products in\ninformation.\nThat’s when we started setting ourselves apart. This was the beginning of buildin g a tribe. We were\ntruly connecting  with our audience,  and we weren’t  just streaming  out financial  information.  We were\ncreating  information  in a way that made  us more  relatable  and more  engaging  to our audience.\nYou need to establish yourself as the maste r in your space. Standing out isn’t just about your product.\nYes, you are hopefully  offering  something  different,  something  new that provides  value,  but you have to\ndo more than that. You have to position yourself as an expert who is knowledgeable, trustworthy, and\nrelatable.\nTo do that,  you need to become  the face of the company.  You have to establish  yourself  as a character\nwith an enticing  story  that people  relate  to so that they will become  invested  in you as a person.  Then,\nthey will want  to support  your company.\nIt’s not enough to just share a photograph of yourself. You need a real story.\n| R YAN D . LEE & BR ADLE  Y GIBB  166\nIn order  to find that, you have to find your “X factor”.  What  makes  you stand  out? Why are you different?\nWhat  can you offer that nobody  else can?\nIf you find yourself  thinking,  “Oh, it’s just me. I’m just ordinary.  I don’t  have a way to stand  out,” you’re\nwrong.  Everybody  has a superpower.  Everybody  has an “X factor.”  You just have to find yours.\nWhat do you specialize in? You might have a skill or talent that you are bringing to the table that sets\nyou apart from the rest of the crowd.\nWhat  are you super  passionate  about  that could  also be relevant  to your client base?  What  is the thing\nthat you obsess  over, that you spend  time researching  and learning  about  after  your spouse  goes to\nbed? To somebody  else, that’s  going  to look like a superpower.\nYou’ll  know  you found  your superpower  when  somebody  else gets excited  about  it, and you think  to\nyourself,  “Wait,  doesn’t  everybody  do that?”\nI used to watch YouTube videos all the time on how to program excel spreadsheets. I gathered this\nknowledge  and skill set, but I really  didn’t  think  of it as a superpower  or a highly  valued  skill. In my mind,\neverybody knew it. I guess I thought everyone was watching those videos and learning the skills. In\nreality,  it was a specialization  that I had built.\nYou have something, you just have to dig in and find it.\nOnce  you do, you have the framework  for your story,  the story  of how what you do made  an impact  in\nyour life and why the client  should  believe  in you. (That’s  why they’ll  choose  you, not because  of how\ngood your product  is.)\nAs you put together  your story,  think  of yourself  as a character.  What  is your backstory?  What  are your\nflaws?  What  mistakes  did you make  that you had to overcome?\nThink about the emotions that your audience has. People buy based on emotion, not on rationalization.\nCreate your ori gin story, one that shows what strengths you have, what your identity is, what your\njourney has looked like, and that will strike an emotional chord with your followers.\nPosition yourself as a leader. Remember these 6 rules to becoming an effective leader:\n1. Live the life your clients  wish they could  live. This is the key to becoming  a leader  that\npeople  want to follow.  Your story should  inspire  your clients  and give them  hope for the\nlife they want to lead.  It’s really  important  that you are truly living  this life. Otherwise,\nyou’re just selling.\n2. Maintain  absolute  certainty.  It’s about  more  than just being  confident.  You have to be\nabsolutely  certain  that what  you are teaching  is the absolute  truth,  that what  you are\nproviding  will have a major  impact  on your clients.\n3. Don’t be boring. If you are creating a movement, you have to be engaging. Show your\npersonality.\n4. Understand how to use persuasion. Most people are not predisposed to action. You\nhave to give them  a reason  to step outside  of their comfort  zone and act.\n5. Care a lot. You can’t  fake this. As a leader,  you should  genuinely  care about  your client’s\nsuccess  and want to contribute  to it.\n| R YAN D . LEE & BR ADLE  Y GIBB  167\n6. Offer  your followers  value  from the relationship.  This seems  obvious,  but it’s important\nto be intentional  about  it. A real leader  isn’t just after a purchase.  They’re  building  value\nfor their clients  as well.\nUsing those concepts and rules, you can create an origin story that will resonate with your client base.\nCraft Your MESSAGE\nNext, you have to craft your message, but not just any message. The right one. Your message is the\nthing  that will cut through  all of the noise,  the competition  in the industry  and the objections  potential\nclients  will have.  It will allow them  to see you as the solution  to their problems.\nThis is the issue we faced when we were trying traditional marketing techniques. We wanted to  throw\nmoney at someone else so they could solve our marketing problems for us. What ended up happening\nis they created  a message  that wasn’t  ours. It didn’t  hit at the core of our business  or who we were.\nBecause the message wasn’t ours, it brought clients  who weren’t the right clients for us. We’d get\nfrustrated and try again, but the cycle repeated itself.\nThis changed  when  we finally  learned  that you can never,  ever outsource  the message.  You are the\nmessage.\nEmbrace that. Build a message that reflects who you truly are and what impact you want to have on\nyour clients.\nThis should have a future -minded focus. What can you offer that will improve the lives of your  clients,\nnow and in the future?  What  are you moving  towards  that you will lead your followers  to? It needs  to be\none specific  action.\nIn our business now, we offer much more than financial advising. We present ourselves as the option\nthat will give our clients  true control  over their financial  planning  so that they can achieve  full financial\nfreedom  in ten years  or less.\nOur clients  aren’t  just buying  a one-time purchase.  They’re  making  an investment  in their future  and\nempowering  themselves  in their own financial  planning.\nYou have to find that element:  what you and your clients  can grow towards  in the future.  That sets you\napart  and makes  sure you are heard.\nIdentify Your MARKET\nIf you take the same advice from me that we took from Garrett and Russell, identifying your market\ndoesn’t have to be difficult. You already have the market in your existing client list.\nYou don’t  have to go implement  cheesy  sales techniques.  You don’t  have to waste  time trying  to market\nto people  who have zero interest  in what you have to offer.  Forget  those  people.\nIf you target  the wrong  people,  you’re  going  to spend  way too much  time and money  trying  to educate\nthem  on the value  you bring  with no guarantee  that they will be persuaded.\nInstead, go after the people you already know, who already know you. Find your market in your existing\n| R YAN D . LEE & BR ADLE  Y GIBB  168\nclient  base,  then let them  share  that message  and expand  your market  reach.  That’s  the easiest  way to\ngrow your first 100 clients  into the next 100, and so on.\nBreak Out of The Mold\nUltimately,  what  we did when  we entered  the ClickFunnels  world  was create  our own movement.  By\nestablishing  ourselves  as experts  and thought  leaders,  we shifted  the focus  of our business  and took\ncontrol  of our lives.\nBefore, we were living as slaves to our business. We hated the commute, the suits, the meetings with\nclients with whom we had no interest in working.\nNow, we don’t  have to compete  the way all the other  financial  advisers  do. We now have peace  of mind\nand control  of our own time and schedule.  We get to run a multi -million  dollar  financial  company  from\nour own homes.  We don’t  need an office  or an expensive  suit. We get to be 100% us, 100% comfortable,\nand still serve  our clients  at a high level.\nThat’s  what  you can achieve  if you follow  these  steps  and embrace  a positive  change  in the trajectory\nof your business.  You can unshackle  yourself  and break  the mold  of what  you think  your business  is, in\norder  to open the door for what  it could  become.\n| B R I C K & MOR TAR F U N N E L  S 169\nTyler Shaule\nFounder of OnlineClients.com &\nSticky Customers\nTyler is a serial  entrepreneur  with a passion  for serving  others\nwith his expertise  in online  marketing  and sales.

My strategies  are contrary  to most “online  marketing  gurus”,  and my\ncompany  is polarizing.  We don’t  solely  focus  on automation  or advertising  but instead  seek to amplify\na business’  “offline”  sales process  using  online  marketing  strategies.\nThe current  state  of online  marketing  preaches  “churn  and burn”  and “buy or bye” tactics  that rely on a\nhigh volume  of cheap,  unqualified  leads  that will make  a purchasing  decision  through  an online  cart or\ncheckout  system.  The result  is impersonal,  almost  anonymous  communication  with just a few sales to\nbad fit clients  that waste  your time or refund.  This style of business  growth  is unsustainable,  damaging\nto your reputation  and generally  not fun.\nMy mission  is to help owners  use online  marketing  to grow their business  without  hiding  behind  their\ncomputer  or feeling  spammy.  Instead,  I aim to infuse  their online  marketing  with personalization  and\nmake  their inbound  sales process  more  conversational.\nThis chapter  is going  to give you a simple  roadmap  of proven  strategies  and three  powerful  marketing\ncampaigns  that I’ve used to book thousands  of appointments,  salescalls  and“conversion  conversations”\nfor brick  and mortar  businesses.  The outcome  will be a step-by-step plan that you can use to get 100\nclients  or customers  in the next 100 days.\nUp until now, my methods  were reserved  for paying  clients  (starting  at $18,000  per year),  but because\nI adore  Russell  Brunson  and am honored  to call him my marketing  mentor,  I’m willing  to gift these\nproven  campaigns  to you inside  this chapter.\nFirst, I must share some much needed foundational knowledge (and the secret to much of my success).\nWhy Listen to Me?\nOver the last two years I’ve been helping “offline” businesses use online marketing to find, get, and\nkeep dream clients.\n| T Y L E R  SHA ULE 171\nSo far we’ve  served  chiropractors,  dentists,  irrigation  companies,  landscape  consultants,  golf courses,\ngyms  and fitness  studios,  car dealerships,  medical  spas,  summer  camps,  apartment  rental  companies,\nlaw practices,  dog groomers,  dermatology  clinics,  home  cleaning  companies,  float therapy  locations,\nloan officers,  real estate  agents  and many  more  personal,  home  and professional  service  businesses.\nThe only similarity  between  these  clients  is that they all need to have a real conversation  with a\ncommitted  and qualified  prospect  before  they make  a sale. Some  of these  conversations  happen  over\nthe phone.  Some  happen  in person  at a coffee  shop,  and others  may happen  at one of your locations\nor your office.  The fact remains  that a real human -to-human  conversation  is what  creates  a buyer  from\nan interested  prospect.\nConversations = Conversions\nMany  local and service  businesseshave  been convinced  by trendy  marketing  gurus  that online  marketing\nis the answer  to their problems  because  it removes  human -to-human  contact,  sales conversations,  and\nother  “non-scalable”  activities,  but this is at best a myth  and at worst  a bold faced  lie.\nOnline marketing is not meant to replace the need for conversations but rather to pre -frame the\nhuman -to-human  contact  as infinitely  valuable.  It is meant  to make  the inevitable  sales conversation\nmore  powerful  and leveraged  because  they believe  the promises  your offer makes,  and they trust you.\nIn fact, the best way to convert  online  marketing  leads  into inbound  sales is with a conversation.\nBegin with the End in Mind\nStephen Covey is famous for saying “begin with the end in mind”, and he wasn’t wrong. Brick  and\nmortar  business  owners  need to make  sure they are designing  their marketing  and sales funnel  to fit\nthe outcome  they need:  a conversation!\nIf you need to have an in-person  meeting  for a sale to happen  it makes  sense  to get an appointment\nbooked  in your prospect’s  calendar  and get their mobile  number  so you can send a reminder.\nIf your business  requires  a phone  conversation  to make  a sale then you better  make  sure you collect  a\nphone  number  (even  better  is a mobile  number)  during  your initial  marketing  efforts!\nThe Mobile Moment\nDid you know that the internet is undergoing a dramatic shift that no one is talking about?\nIn 2017, there were about 2.25 billion smartphones shipped to customers across the world, and only\n250 million laptop and desktop computers were manufactured.\nWhy does this matter?  Well,  81% of Americans  now use a smartphone  for about  3 hours  per day (up\nfrom just 35% in 2011),  and the result  is a whole  generation  that uses the internet  differently  than ever\nbefore.\nIn 2019:\n• the YouTube  app accounts  for 37% of ALL internet  usage,\n• over 96% of Facebook  users  access  their  account  through  the mobile  app and\n| T Y L E R  SHA ULE 172\n• Google  reports  that over 58% of all searches  on their  platform  are done  from a mobile  device.\nCombine  these  facts with the statistic  that a smartphone  is within  3 feet of its owner  for 23.5 hours  per\nday, and you will realize  we have a new reality.\nOnline = On a Smartphone\nMost online  marketers  have not made  the transition  to a mobile  first strategy.  They are trying  to fit\nold online  marketing  tactics  into the new way we are using  the internet…  which  is in our hands,  with a\nsmartphone.\nIt’s hard to get a prospect to watch a webinar on a smartphone screen or get a lead to accurately fill\nout a opt-in form while  they pinch,  zoom  and scroll  with their fingers  all over the beautifully  designed\nwebpage  that was built for a desktop.\nAlthough  these  changes  pose a problem  for marketers,  they represent  an unfair  advantage  for business\nowners  that already  use the phone  in their sales process!\nConnect Online Marketing to “Offline” Sales Conversations with SMS\nRemember  what  I said about  successful  brick  and mortar  business  owners  only needing  one systematic\nway to get great  prospects  to a sales conversation?  Let’s start designing  the Phone  Funnel  System  that\nyour business  can use to find, get and keep customers!\n| T Y L E R  SHA ULE 173\nYour prospects are already using their smartphones to:\n• scroll on  Instagram,\n• watch  videos  on YouTube,\n• search on  Google,\n• browse  in Chrome  and\n• connect  with friends  on Facebook.\nMy brick  and mortar  marketing  strategy  (aka The Phone  Funnel  System)  is all about  how to create  a\nbridge  from this kind of mobile  online  traffic  into a sales conversation  on that very same  smartphone.\nText messaging  (also known  as SMS) is the perfect  bridge  between  mobile  online  traffic  and a sales\nconversation.  All smartphones  have an SMS app built right into them,  and most phone  plans  included\nunlimited  texting!\nYou can send links,  contact  information,  photos  and videos  through  text messaging,  and when  someone\nclicks  any link, it will open in the native  smartphone  app immediately.\nSmartphones also play a major role in keeping track of our calendars (iCal, Google Calendar and\nOutlook  all have popular  mobile  apps),  so if you need to set up an appointment  for an in person  meeting\nthen SMS acts as a bridge  between  the mobile  traffic  and the calendar  booking.\nSending text messages to leads and prospects has the added advantage of positioning your\ncommunication  in a channel  that is normally  exclusive  to people  that they know  well (friends,  family\nmembers  and other  trusted  people).  SMS has a 98% open  rate and about  a 90 second  response  time.\nBy contrast,  email  response  time is over 90 minutes,  and that’s  if the contact  even opens  it to begin\nwith!\nSMS is the best emerging marketing channel because:\n• Everyone  has a phone  in their hand or pocket\n• Of the 98% open  rate text messages  have texting,  which  is easy and lower  risk than\nanswering a  call\n• It is fully integrated  with smartphone  functions  we use daily (web search,  social  media\napps,  and your contacts  & calendar)\n• It provides great positioning because it’s usually reserved for communicating with\npeople  that we trust\n• Replying  to texts  is implicit  within  the mode  of communication  itself  (it’s naturally  a\nconversational  medium,  unlike  email.  Just think  about  the last email  you replied  to...\nwas it a marketing  email?  I bet not.).\nShotgun vs. Sniper Rifle\nMost online  marketing  strategies  are kind of like a shotgun.  You blast communication  (most  likely  an\nemail  broadcast)  and hope that you hit upon something  important  to your audience  and that they do\nwhat  you tell them  to (most  likely  click a link and view some  content).\nI prefer to design my marketing like a sniper rifle. The  communication needs to be specific and targeted\n| T Y L E R  SHA ULE 174\nwith the outcome  being  immediate  feedback.  SMS is the most targeted  mass communication  format\nI’ve found  that encourages  rapid  feedback:  a reply!\nIf you are serious about serving your audience at the highest level and inspiring trust in the valuable\nproduct or service you sell, then it makes sense that you need to invest in SMS marketing.\nTHE THREE SIMPLE TEXT MESSAGING CAMPAIGNS\nEach of the three  funnels  I’m revealing  to you in this chapter  leverage  SMS as a convenient  and effective\nway to get a conversation  going  with a prospect.  ClickFunnels  easily  integrates  with Twilio  to allow  you\nto send SMS messages  as part of your automated  Follow -Up Funnel  and bridge  the gap between  online\nmarketing  and having  a sales conversation  on the phone  or in-person  with a prospect.\nThe premise  of this book is to provide  brick  and mortar  business  owners  with the most potent  strategies\nto attract  100 customers  in the next 100 days.  These  three  funnels  are the best options  I know  to find,\nget and keep customers  or clients  for a brick  and mortar  business.\n#1: The Reactivation Funnel\nThe first strategy I recommend for Brick and Mortar businesses to implement is the Reactivation\nFunnel.  This funnel  reaches  out to your past leads  and customers  and engages  them  with a fresh  offer,\nnurtures  them  with SMS follow  up communication  and prompts  them  to book an appointment  in your\ncalendar  for a phone  call or visit to your location.\nIt’s best to start with this funnel because it provides a quick way to test your new offer,  schedule\nappointments  and make  sales without  having  to spend  time and money  on advertising.\nHere is exactly what I would do:\n1. In the first step,  I will collect  all my database  contact  information  of past leads  and customers,\npaying  special  attention  to the mobile  phone  number  I have on file for them.  I will create  an email\nlist of contacts  inside  ClickFunnels  and upload  my contacts’  information  with a .csv file, making\nsure to correctly  match  fields  so I don’t  lose any information.  Next,  I will create  a new Follow -Up\nFunnel  inside  ClickFunnels  that will send automated  SMS broadcasts  to the list about  my new offer.\nFor best results,  I’ll choose  to split my list up into groups  of 100 contacts  and start a new group  on\nthe SMS Follow -Up Funnel  each Monday.  The reason?  I don’t  want  to message  my full list all at the\nsame  time because  I won’t  be able to turn off the faucet  of hot leads  coming  your way, and it could\nget overwhelming fast! Remember: the key to this funnel is responding to interested  contacts\n| T Y L E R  SHA ULE 175\nlightning  fast and booking  an appointment.\nTo supercharge my SMS marketing, I will also consider using a two-way text service (ClickFunnels\nworks great with conversations.io ) that will allow me to reply back in real time, send a ringless\nvoicemail  or receive  an inbound  phone  call.\n2. Next,  I will “offer  hack”  my competitors  to figure  out what I should  offer  to reactivate  my past leads\nand customers.  These  contacts  are people  that I have known  in the past;  I already  have some  trust\nestablished  with them.  Make  sure the offer  must have an appointment  booking  component  for\nfulfillment.\nI will use Groupon,  my competitors’  websites  or examples  from advertising  to see what offers  other\npeople are currently  running.\nHere are some successful offers I have run for clients:\n• Free Teeth  Whitening,\n• Free 10 Day Gym Pass\n• $25 for two room  carpet  cleaning\n• Free 30 minute  massage  (with  a chiropractic  consultation)\n• Free teeth  scaling  (for a dog grooming  offer)\n• Free limited  edition  camp  t-shirt (with  registration)\n• No cost initial  consultation  (for a law practice)\n• Free window  cleaning  (for a siding  installation  & roofing  company)\nEvery 90 days or at least after I have put all my contacts in my database through this funnel once,\nI will “repackage” my offer to make it look new.\n3. My call-to-action  is an appointment  booking.  This step is critical  to the success  of this funnel.  I\nmust e stablish the prospect’s commitment through booking a specific date and time for their\nappointment!  I will use a link to send the contact  to my ClickFunnels  Calendar  Booking  funnel  step\nto confirm  appointment  date and time.\nIf I’m using a tool like conversations.io to do real time texting, I’ll make sure to keep up the text\nconversation and nurture the contact with replies and answer questions they have. These SMS\nconversations are invaluable to really act like that  “sniper rifle”, allowing you to target responding\npeople  and specifically  communicate  with them.\nMany  business  owners  I work with initially  dismiss  this funnel  as a time waster  or claim  that it’s not\nscalable because it requires a staff member (or them) to reply to 2 to 4 text messages on average\nbefore  they can book an appointment.  My answer  is always  the same:\n“Do you want  lots of free time on your hands  or do you want  a calendar  full of sales appointments\nwith prospects who have already shown interest in your product or service by spending time\ncommunicating  with you and have taken  the initiative  to put you into their busy calendars?”\nOnce we get started  with clients,  they quickly  see the error in their thinking!  In fact, many  of my clients\nreport  that they could  keep their calendars  full and business  booming  with just this one funnel!\n| T Y L E R  SHA ULE 176\n#2: “Ad -To-Appointment” Funnels\nThe social media networks have popularized online advertising for small business owners and created\na frenzied  environment  where  everyone  is clamoring  to be an advertising  expert,“influencer”  or agency\nowner.\nI believe the skill of advertising is important, but based on my experience, c onversion is a more\nimportant  skill to master.  The actual  advertisement  is not the key to success,  but rather  it is what  comes\nafter  the first click that really  matters.  Unfortunately,  this has been forgotten  in the world  of online\nadvertising.  My Ad-to-Appointment  Funnels  are successful  because  of the conversion  mechanism  we\nhave developed  and less about  the social  media  ad itself.\nSuccessfully  using  online  or social  advertising  to increase  sales appointments  and revenue  is a high\nleverage  strategy,  but it can take some  time to figure  out and often  is costly  initially.  My recommendation\nto brick and mortar business owners is to get their Reactivation Funnel producing first and then\nsupplement  with the Ad-to-Appointment  Funnels.\nAs I describe  how to implement  these  two varieties  of the Ad-to-Appointment  Funnel,  I’m not going\nto dwell  on the actual  ads at all. Instead,  I want  to explain  how I qualify  and convert  cold social  media\ntraffic  into sales appointments  on a daily basis.\n“Special Offer -to-Appointment”  Funnel\nThis funnel works well for personal service providers or health and medical service professionals. The\nSpecial Offer -to-Appointment Funnel’s goal is to convert attention from a social ad (that promises the\nspecial offer) into a text message conversation. T he next step is to deliver the promised special offer\nvia SMS and set up the appointment for the fulfillment of that special offer.\nHere is how I would execute the Special Offer -to-Appointment Funnel:\n1. The first step in this funnel is to make sure I am using an offer that I know has worked for my\nbusiness  recently.  This is not the time to test! I’ll think  back to my Reactivation  Funnel  and the offers\nthat have had success, picking my best one. This funnel works best for “free offers” or “discount\noffers”  because  they are great  at attracting  the attention  of interested  audiences  on a social  media\nnetwork.\n| T Y L E R  SHA ULE 177\n2. Next,  I will create  the social  media  advertisement  and design  the conversion  mechanism  for that ad\nWhile  I’m not going  to dive into the full checklist  of how to create  a profitable  ad, I do want  to offer\nguidance  on the type of conversion  event  that should  be used here.\nRemember  “The Phone  Funnel  System”  sketch  from earlier  in this chapter?  My next step needs  to\nbe getting  the prospect  from the social  ad they are viewing  on their smartphone  and into an SMS\nconversation  with me. Later  in the funnel  I will get them  from the SMS conversation  and into my\noffline  sales process  (a phone  call, meeting,  or appointment  at your location).\nI use two methods to convert ad viewers into SMS conversations.\n• Clickfunnels  page with SMS opt-in\n• Lead Form Ad format  (available  on Facebook,  Instagram  and LinkedIn)\nThrough ClickFunnels’ integration with the online platform Twilio, the SMS Opt -In element\nautomatically  captures  a contact’s  mobile  phone  number  to their profile.  With Follow -Up Funnels,\nI can easily  add SMS broadcasts  from this information  or create  an automated  Follow -Up Funnel\nthat can send text messages.\nUsing  a Lead Form as part of my ad is a more  advanced  method  but is a far superior  conversion\nmechanism.  A Facebook  Lead Form Ad uses a customizable  native  form inside  the ad that populates\nwith information  that Facebook  already  knows  about  a user automatically.\nFacebook  knows  your contacts  mobile  number  for its backup  two-step verification  process,  and it\nwill populate  into the form as soon as the user clicks  on your ad. All that is left for the user to do to\nopt-in is to click “submit”!  Many  years  ago advertisers  wrote  off Facebook’s  lead ads as ineffective\nbecause  the email  address  that Facebook  has for most users  is not current  or not their primary\naccount. However, very few people have more than one mobile number, so when I ask for the\nmobile  number  in this form,  I see over a 95% deliverability  rate in the SMS I send right after  the\nform completion.\nI use Zapier  to send the collected  mobile  numbers  from the Facebook  Lead Form ad to ClickFunnels,\nand from there  I use Follow -Up Funnels  to send the SMS campaign.\n3. As with all of these  funnels,  the last part is the main event!  I need to nurture  that new lead using  SMS\nand work to get them  to book a time in my calendar  for a conversation!  As part of the SMS nurture,\nI make  sure to keep up with real time replies  to my prospects’  questions.  If they aren’t  engaged,  I\nsend a conversation -starting  question  to them.\n“Survey -to-Appointment” Funnel\nThis type of funnel  works  best for brick  and mortar  businesses  that don’t  offer an item or service  for\nfree but instead  need an initial  consultation  with a prospect.  Loan officers,  contractors,  law practices\nor cosmetic  surgery  clinics  are great  examples  of businesses  that would  use a Survey -to-Appointment\nFunnel.\nThe idea of a survey  is to draw  your prospect  into answering  initial  questions  that will quickly  and\nconveniently  lead to them  receiving  valuable  information.  Most homeowners  would  love to know  how\nmuch  it will cost to fix their leaky  roof. However  choosing  a roofing  company,  picking  up the phone\nto call them  and then requesting  an estimate  is too much  work and they will procrastinate  endlessly.\n| T Y L E R  SHA ULE 178\nImagine  if that same  homeowner  was scrolling  on Facebook  and saw your advertised  post that asked\nthem  if they would  like an estimate  for the cost of their roof and all they had to do was answer  three\nsimple  questions.  What  option  do you think  they would  take?\nSurvey -to-Appointment  Funnels  are designed  to be a low commitment  method  for leads  to receive\nhigh-value  personalized  information.  Make  sure to position  your requirement  for the SMS opt-in as the\ndelivery  method  for this highly  valued  and personalized  answer  to their problem.\nHere is how I would create the Survey -to-Appointment Funnel:\n1. First,  I design  my survey.  It should  be short,  only three  to five questions  with the first two questions\nbeing  very easy to complete.  I also want  to include  one or two questions  that help me qualify  my\nleads,  segment  them  and identify  my best prospects.  For the roofing  example,  I may want to ask\nthe homeowner  about  their home’s  overall  square  footage  size and about  how soon they want  to\ninstall  a new roof. The answers  to these  questions  would  help me determine  the overall  value  of a\nroofing  job and which  lead was more  serious  about  making  a decision  to hire a roofer  based  on the\ntiming  they indicated  in the second  answer.\nClickFunnels  has a survey  builder  element  which  I will use to easily  create  and embed  a conditional\nlogic survey or quiz onto a ClickFunnels landing page along with an SMS opt -in element. Another\nsurvey  tool I recommend  is conversations.io .\n2. I will send an SMS with the helpful  information  or report  that is generated  from the quiz or survey.\nI will follow  up with more  text messages  and answer  any further  questions  the prospect  has about\nmy service.  Many of my clients end up selling packages right over the SMS conversation at this\npoint  because  the prospect  has been so thoroughly  qualified  with the survey  and they are ready  to\nbecome a  buyer!\n3. I will get the prospect  to schedule  an appointment  on my calendar.  Once  I have a prospect  complete\na booking,  I will send them  frequent  SMS reminders  of their meeting  or phone  call time so they\ndon’t  forget  to attend.  If they don’t  show  up, I will simply  send them  a text message  and let them\nknow  they missed  out and can reschedule  for the next convenient  day. However,  I always  mention\nthat after  that,  the offer  may not be available.\n| T Y L E R  SHA ULE 179\nDon’t  sleep  on Survey -to-Appointment  Funnels.  They are incredibly  powerful.  My second  Two Comma\nClub Award  came  from a survey  funnel  in my brick  and mortar  business  that did over $1.3 Million  in\njust 7  months!\n#3: Rate, Review & Referral Funnel\nAlthough  I’m presenting  the Rate,  Review  & Refer  Funnel  last, I recommend  that all brick  and mortar\nbusinesses implement it far sooner than any marketing strategy that involves getting leads from\nadvertising.  I’m a firm believer  in creating  retention,  resell,  upsell  and referral  opportunities  that create\nexpansion  revenue  while  not dramatically  increasing  costs  like advertising.\nThe best kind of revenue  in a business  is repeating  revenue.  When  you can have the same  customer  or\nclient  continue  being  a buyer  on a regular  basis then you reduce  your costs  and increase  your profits!\nEvery brick and mortar business needs a reliable way to predict the likelihood of a customer buying\nagain, as well as leveraging that customer to gain a steady stream of referrals.\nAbout  5 years  ago, I read The Ultimate  Question  by Fred Reichheld,  and I implemented  the Net Promoter\nScore  (NPS)  in my business  shortly  after.  The NPS is a two question  rating  system  that is designed  to:\n• Collect  genuine  customer  feedback  on how to serve  them  better,\n• Predict  which  customers  will return  as a buyer  again,  and\n• Pre-frame your customers to refer your business to their family, friends, neighbors\nand colleagues.\nThe NPS asks these two questions.\n1. On a scale  of 1-10, with 10 being  very likely,  how likely  are you to recommend  (your\nbusiness  name  here)  to your family,  friends,  neighbors  or colleagues?\n2. How could  (your  business  name  here)  achieve  a score  closer  to 10?\nThe strength  of the NPS is the clarity  it provides.  Scores  of 9 or 10 signify  a customer  that is very likely\nto both buy again  and refer (otherwise  called  a promoter),  while  those  that give a score  of 6 are likely  to\nbecome  an active  detractor  that will share  about  your business  in a cynical  and negative  way. Scores\nof 7 and 8 are labeled  as passive,  neither  promoting  or detracting.\nThe initial  phase  of this funnel  is to identify  “promoters”  by asking  for a rating.  The second  step of the\nfunnel  is to request  a review  on a platform  like Google  Reviews,  Facebook  Recommendation  or Yelp.\nThe last step of the funnel  is to send a “Buddy  Offer”  to the customer  that they can share  with others\nthey know.  Connecting  each phase  of this funnel  with SMS makes  sense  because  it’s an intimate  way\nof communicating that also provides easy access to both webpages and the review platforms on  a\ncustomer’s  smartphone,  the place  they are most likely  to spend  a minute  or two to send your feedback\nand provide  a review.  Sharing  the “Buddy  Offer”  is also made  even easier  when  you text it to a customer\nbecause  all the contacts  that you hope they send it to are already  stored  in their smartphone!\n| T Y L E R  SHA ULE 180\n1. I will build the NPS Rating page on a Clickfunnels page using the survey builder element. I will add\nconditional logic for answers of 9 and 10 to be forwarded to the Google ‘My Business’ Review  page\nautomatically (using conversations.io for this feature). I will send a personal follow up message to\nall the contacts with an NPS feedback of less than 7 so that I can work to improve my business\nbased on customer  feedback.\n2. Collecting  about  300 five star reviews  is quickly  becoming  a necessity  for brick and mortar  businesses.\nProspects  place  a high value  on social  proof  and many  review  platforms  receive  a high degree  of\nvisibility  (especially  Google  Reviews  and Facebook  Recommendations).  Intentionally  gathering  as\nmany  positive  reviews  as possible  is also a way to mitigate  the inevitable  negative  review.  It’s often\nnot possible  to avoid  a few bad reviews.  To make  sure they are not prominent,  it’s vital to have an\noverwhelming  number  of positive  reviews.\n3. The referral  phase  of this funnel  is key to growing  my business.  Often  referral  customers  can be my\nbest customers because of the endorsement given by the referrer. Not only am I being esteemed by\nthe referrer,  but since  they have first hand experience  with your service  they are unlikely  to refer yo u\nto an unqualified  person.  I prefer  to use a “Buddy  Offer”  style referral.  This type of referral  relies on\nthe generosity of the customer to want their friends to experience the same benefit they did.  I will\nbe sure to play off the increase in status for the sharer of the “Buddy Offer” because they  are\nhelping improve the lives of their friends and ac hieve something they themselves have already\nexperienced.  An example  of a “Buddy  Offer”  for a gym or fitness  studio  would  be a free 10 day pass\nfor a friend.\nWithin  this funnel,  I will be prompt  in my communication.  As soon as the fulfillment  or delivery\nportion  of my service  for the customer  is complete,  I will send the Rating  request  link by SMS. Using\ntext messaging  will ensure  it’s seen and responded  to more  quickly  than email.  As the customer\nshows  commitment  and completes  a stage  of this funnel,  I will send the next request  immediately\nand leverage  their current  momentum.  Customers  that give my business  a great  rating  and leave  a\nreview  are highly  likely  to also be prolific  referral  partners!  I will thank  them,  stay close  to them  and\nbe sure to remind  them  to continue  to refer people  to my service.\nHere is how I would  execute  the Rate,  Review  & Referral  Funnel:\n| T Y L E R  SHA ULE 181\nConclusion\nThese  three  funnels  represent  all you need to find, get and keep 100 customers  or clients  in the next\n100 days. Start by developing your Reactivation Funnel with SMS conversations that engages your\ndatabase  of past leads  and customers  with an irresistible  offer.\nMy clients  often  find that it can take a couple  tries to nail the right reactivation  offer,  so don’t  give up if\nthe first one isn’t a success!  If you have been in business  for a year or two, you likely  have at least 1,000\ncontacts in your database. Start by sending 100-150 of your contacts to the Reactivation Funnel each\nweek. On average about 10% of those contacts will book an appointment with you and about half will\npurchase.  The result  will be over 50 customers  in your first 50 days of applying  this strategy.\nOnce you have the Reactivation  Funnel  running  on autopilot,  take a week  to implement  the Rate,  Review\nand Referral Funnel. My clients regularly see about 15% of their clients actively refer a friend through\nthis funnel.
