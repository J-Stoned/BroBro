Missed calls don't have to mean missed revenue anymore. With High Level's phone settings, the system can automatically text a caller back the moment the call goes unanswered. That text includes a booking link. So, instead of a lead cooling off, your hot lead can book an appointment right away. It's simple, it's powerful, and it keeps opportunities from slipping through the cracks. Here's how it works. The second a call is missed, High Leo sends out a polite text message. That text message includes a link to your calendar so the caller can choose a time that best works for them. It even works after hours so that your business is still capturing demand even when you're closed. And once they book that appointment, the appointment is automatically confirmed and logged right into your Highle account or your calendar. There's no voicemail needed, no follow-up needed, just instant connection. And this is how you set it up inside your Highle account. If you come down to your settings and then up to phone numbers, click on additional settings and then come down to voicemail and miss call text back. You can see when you scroll down to the bottom, you can toggle on this button. This means that after every miss call, this text message is going to be sent out to them. You can customize this message right over here by clicking the customize button. You'll be able to adjust the message. And if you want to add your calendar link right into the message, if you do not have one created, then the first thing you want to do is click on back here, come over to calendars on the left hand side, and click on new calendar. Then choose the calendar you want to create. Give it a name, select the team member, and then click on confirm. Now that your calendar has been created, you can grab the link by coming up to this button over here. Click on copy and then go back to your phone numbers on the left hand side. Back to additional settings, voicemail and miss call text back. Scroll down, click on customize, and then you can come down here and then just paste your link. When you click on save, the message will be saved. And now every time this business misses a call, this text message will be sent out to them. When they get that SMS and they click on that link, it will take them straight to this calendar where they can book a time, add the information in, and then click on schedule meeting. Now, when you come back to your calendar, you'll see at that time that slot has now been booked. And if you're using the mobile app, inside the calendar feature in the app, you will also see the booking. Agencies love this feature because it's a fast win with almost no effort. It lives right inside of High Level, so you don't need any extra tools or complicated integrations. Clients get happier because they lose fewer leads. Businesses book more appointments without lifting a finger. And for you, it's a great story to tell your sales team. So that's how Highle can turn missed calls into booked appointments.
