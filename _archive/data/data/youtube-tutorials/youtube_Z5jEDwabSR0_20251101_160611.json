You don't have to look like you're using someone else's software. With High Lee, you can put your logo, your colors, and your domain on the client dashboard. So, every time your client logs in, they see your brand, not ours. That instantly shifts the perception instead of being just another agency. You are the platform provider powering their growth. Here's what branded dashboards unlock for you. You can brand the entire experience with your custom domain, your logo, and your color palette. You can centralize KPIs like leads, calls, appointments, and pipeline all in one place. You can keep control simple with clean layouts and role-based access for each client. Instead of just telling clients about their results, you can show them inside a platform that carries your name. Here's how it works. Inside your highle agency view, if you come down to settings and then up to company, you'll see right over here it says white label. Click on that and then right here you can add your logo. When you add your logo here, it will appear right over there. So every time your client logs in, this is the logo that will be shown. Then below that you can add your white label domain. So what is the link that they're going to use to log into your platform? For example, it can be app.youdmain.com. Once they type that in, it will take them to a branded login page. Down below over here, you can toggle on Google login. This means you're giving them an option to log into their account using Google. Once we have completed that, we would have changed the domain as well as the logo. So it will now be completely white labelled showing your information instead of ours. Now to customize the dashboard for your client, you first want to go into their sub account. You can do that by coming up to the top left here, clicking on their sub account, and it will take you into their account. You'll see we're on the dashboard page over here. Now, to edit this dashboard with your colors and to change the style a bit, you can come up to the pencil icon in the top right. Or if you want to create a brand new dashboard, click on this blue button on the left hand side and then click on add dashboard. For now, I'm just going to click on this pencil icon. And we are now in the editing dashboard page. What we can do from here is delete widgets that we don't want to show by clicking the three dots and then delete. Or if you want to add a widget, we can click on add widget. scroll through the different widgets that we want to add. Let me just choose which widget we want to add in. I'm going to choose on open opportunities. Click on it and then click on save. You'll see it will now have been added to the bottom. You can drag this widget around if you want to change the position and then just drop it when you're happy. If you click on back in the top right corner here and you come over to themes, we can change the color of the dashboard. So, here are some pre-built themes. For instance, blue or green. You'll see when there is data populated, it will change to that color. But if you want to customize it even further, you can click on this color palette over here to see more advanced settings. So if I want to change the background color to a light blue, I can just do that and then click on save changes. Agencies love branded dashboards because they create instant credibility. Your clients log into your platform. They self-s serve answers without blowing up your inbox. And that stickier experience means longer relationships and higher retention. And once you've got your setup dialed in, you can scale it easily by cloning dashboard templates across different accounts. It's professional, it's sticky, and it's one of the easiest ways to position yourself as a tech provider, not just a service vendor. So, that's how High Level helps you create branded dashboards.
