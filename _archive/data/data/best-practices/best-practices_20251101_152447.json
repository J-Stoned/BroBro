You’ll be able to upload your logo, cover image, and favicon, adjust the layout, and fine-tune visual elements to create a consistent, professional experience for your members.\nUpload a Community Logo and Cover Image.\nBranding plays a key role in building trust and recognition within your community. In the Branding tab of the Community Settings, you can upload your favicon, cover image, and logo. The favicon appears in browser tabs, the cover image gives your community visual appeal, and the logo reinforces brand identity throughout the portal. Use recommended dimensions for best display, and don’t worry—you can update these anytime.\nSet up a Custom Domain\nSet Up a Custom Domain A custom domain gives your community a professional touch. Instead of using the default URL, you can set up a branded domain. Navigate to \"Memberships > Communities > Settings\" to find the custom domain menu.\nSet Up a Custom Domain\nUsing a custom domain gives your community a more professional and branded experience. After entering your desired domain name, you’ll need to update your DNS records. Once your records are updated, save the domain settings using the \"Update Domain\" button and wait for DNS propagation to complete. This process ensures your community is accessible through a custom-branded URL instead of the default system-generated one.\nManage Memberships and Roles\nManaging access and assigning roles within your community ensures members receive the right level of interaction and control. Whether you’re running a free discussion group or a gated coaching space, assigning roles like Admin or Contributor gives you flexibility in moderation and collaboration.\nNavigate to the “Members” tab inside your community.Click the “Invite Members” button.\nAdmin Access\nIf the person needs full administrative access, you can toggle the “Give Administrative Privileges” option before sending the invite.

Roles include Admin (full control), Contributor (limited permissions), and Member (basic access), allowing you to tailor access based on each user’s role in your community.\nCreate and Organize Groups\nGroups are the heart of your community, allowing you to segment conversations, content, and member participation by interest or topic. To get started, navigate to the “Groups” section in the community panel. Click the blue “Create Group” button to launch the group setup screen. You’ll enter the group name, a short description, and select privacy settings to determine who can access the group. You can also assign moderators during setup to help manage discussions. Once configured, click “Save” to publish the group and invite members to join the conversation.\nSet Up Channels\nChannels help you structure conversations within your community group, making it easier for members to find and participate in discussions. To add a channel, click the\n”+ Add Channel”\nbutton in the left-hand panel. You can create specific channels like Announcements for updates, SOPs for process documentation, or VIP for exclusive member content. Each channel can be customized with unique icons and privacy settings to help organize communication and ensure the right people see the right content.\nAdd and Manage Courses\nCourses provide structured content that can educate, onboard, or engage your community members. To get started, navigate to the\nLearning\ntab within your community. Click the\n“+ Add Course”\nbutton. This allows you to attach any existing course from your account to the group. Once added, members will see and access the course directly from the community. You can always manage which courses appear, control visibility settings, or remove them later as needed.\nChoose Course and Set Visibility\nAfter clicking “Add Course,” you’ll be prompted to choose an existing course from your library or create a new one. You can customize visibility settings to control access. Choose between making the course available to all members, restricting it to certain member levels, selling it via “Buy Now,” or unlocking it based on time or milestones. These options help you tailor access based on engagement, monetization strategy, or learning progression. Courses linked here are displayed only inside the community group and won’t affect the main course catalog.\nCreate and Schedule Events\nEvents make it easy to host live sessions like office hours, AMAs, and workshops directly in your community. To schedule an event, go to the “Events” tab and click “Create Event.” Fill in the event title, description, event banner or image, and add a meeting link such as a Zoom URL. You can choose to make the event a one-time session or set it to repeat weekly or monthly. Enabling reminders ensures members receive a notification before the event begins, helping boost attendance and engagement.\nImplement Rewards and Gamification\nGamification boosts participation by making your community experience more interactive and fun. Head to the “Leaderboard” section to view or customize member levels like Bronze, Silver, or Gold. Then, go to “Gamification & Rewards” in the settings to assign rewards for reaching each level. These rewards can include course access, promo discounts, or exclusive community roles. For a fully automated experience, use workflows to trigger rewards when members complete actions like submitting a form or finishing a course. This system helps keep members active and invested in your content.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nQ: Can I monetize my community?\nYes.
