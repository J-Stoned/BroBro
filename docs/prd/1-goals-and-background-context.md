# 1. Goals and Background Context

### 1.1 Goals

- Create an AI assistant with comprehensive GoHighLevel domain expertise accessible via Claude Code
- Build a local knowledge base containing official GHL docs, YouTube tutorials, and 2025 best practices
- Implement 15+ specialized slash commands for workflows, funnels, forms, and API integration
- Develop custom MCP servers for GHL API integration with OAuth 2.0 support
- Enable semantic search with <2 second response time for knowledge queries
- Generate ready-to-use workflow configurations and API code examples
- Provide context-aware assistance for SaaS mode setup and snapshot utilization
- Deliver 95%+ answer accuracy with source citations from the knowledge base

### 1.2 Background Context

GoHighLevel users currently face a fragmented learning experience with documentation scattered across official help centers, YouTube tutorials, and community forums. The platform's extensive feature set—including workflows, automations, funnels, forms, calendars, and a comprehensive API—creates a steep learning curve that slows adoption and implementation.

GHL Wiz addresses this by consolidating knowledge into a single, intelligent assistant powered by RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) technology. By training on official documentation, curated YouTube tutorials from experts like Robb Bailey and Shaun Clark, and proven 2025 best practices, the assistant provides instant, context-aware guidance. The integration with Claude Code via Model Context Protocol (MCP) enables seamless access to both knowledge retrieval and direct GHL API manipulation, creating an end-to-end solution for building marketing automation systems.
