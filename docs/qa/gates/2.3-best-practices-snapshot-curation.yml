summary: |
  Story 2.3 is primarily a manual curation effort with minimal technical implementation.
  While the structure and templates are well-defined, the story lacks clear scope boundaries,
  acceptance criteria are somewhat vague on "how much is enough," and there's no clear script
  or automation to support the curation process. This is more content research than development.

strengths:
  - Clear content categories (lead nurturing, appointment automation, form optimization, SaaS setup)
  - Well-defined Markdown templates for best practices and snapshot profiles
  - Good metadata structure (category, effectiveness, source, last verified)
  - Organized directory structure (by topic for practices, by marketplace for snapshots)
  - Source citation requirements for credibility
  - Includes "last verified" dates for currency tracking
  - Structured format designed for easy parsing in downstream chunking (Story 2.4)

findings:
  medium_severity:
    - issue_id: "SCOPE-001"
      description: "AC1 'best practices documented for...' does not specify quantity"
      impact: "Unclear when this AC is satisfied. How many practices per topic?"
      recommendation: "Specify minimum number of practices per category (e.g., 5-10 per topic = 30-60 total)"

    - issue_id: "SCOPE-002"
      description: "AC2 'snapshot marketplace information compiled' lacks quantity target"
      impact: "Unclear how many snapshots to document. 10? 50? 100?"
      recommendation: "Specify target snapshot count (e.g., 30-50 snapshots across all marketplaces)"

    - issue_id: "IMPL-003"
      description: "No script or automation support - entirely manual curation"
      impact: "Time-intensive, error-prone, difficult to validate completeness"
      recommendation: "Consider web scraping for snapshot marketplaces, or at least templates/tooling to speed curation"

    - issue_id: "TEST-004"
      description: "AC6 'source citations included' is not specific about citation format"
      impact: "Inconsistent citations across documents"
      recommendation: "Define citation format (e.g., [Source](URL) - Last Verified: YYYY-MM-DD)"

  low_severity:
    - issue_id: "DATA-005"
      description: "Best practices may become outdated quickly (2025 standards noted)"
      impact: "Content requires periodic review and updates"
      recommendation: "Add maintenance schedule or expiration dates to best practices"

    - issue_id: "QUALITY-006"
      description: "No clear definition of 'proven vs experimental' effectiveness rating"
      impact: "Subjective ratings may be inconsistent"
      recommendation: "Define criteria for proven (widely adopted, documented success) vs experimental (new, limited testing)"

    - issue_id: "TEST-007"
      description: "Content quality validation is manual ('review for accuracy and completeness')"
      impact: "No automated quality checks, relies on human judgment"
      recommendation: "Add automated checks: required sections present, citations valid, word count minimums"

  high_severity:
    - issue_id: "DEP-008"
      description: "Story has no technical blocking dependencies but claims dependency on Story 1.6"
      impact: "Unclear why this story depends on Epic 1 completion - it's independent content curation"
      recommendation: "Clarify dependencies or remove. This story could run in parallel with Epic 1"

testability_score: 5
testability_notes: |
  Limited testability due to manual nature:
  - AC1: How to verify "best practices documented"? No quantity specified
  - AC2: How to verify "snapshot marketplace information compiled"? No quantity target
  - AC3: Can verify snapshot profiles have required fields (name, features, pricing, use cases, reviews)
  - AC4: Can verify files exist in kb/best-practices/ and kb/snapshots-reference/
  - AC5: Can verify content is valid Markdown with proper structure
  - AC6: Can verify citations exist (but not validity without manual checking)

  Major issues:
  - No clear completion criteria (how many best practices? how many snapshots?)
  - Quality validation is entirely manual
  - No automated validation scripts mentioned
  - "Structured Markdown" can be validated but content accuracy cannot

dependencies:
  blocks:
    - "2.4" # Chunking needs all content including best practices and snapshots

  blocked_by: []
    # Story claims dependency on 1.6 but it's unclear why. This is independent content curation.

  parallel_possible:
    - "2.1" # Documentation scraping
    - "2.2" # YouTube extraction
    # This story could run in parallel with most Epic 1 and Epic 2 stories

risks:
  - risk: "Manual curation is time-intensive and may not be completed on schedule"
    mitigation: "Set realistic scope (e.g., 30-50 best practices, 30-50 snapshots). Allocate sufficient time"
    severity: "HIGH"

  - risk: "Content quality may be inconsistent without clear guidelines"
    mitigation: "Define quality criteria, use templates consistently, peer review before acceptance"
    severity: "MEDIUM"

  - risk: "Source citations may link to content that changes or disappears"
    mitigation: "Include 'last verified' dates. Plan for periodic review and updates"
    severity: "MEDIUM"

  - risk: "Snapshot marketplace data may be incomplete or require paid access"
    mitigation: "Focus on publicly available information. Document limitations in snapshot profiles"
    severity: "LOW"

  - risk: "Best practices may conflict with official GHL recommendations"
    mitigation: "Cite sources, note when practices are community-driven vs official"
    severity: "LOW"

recommendations:
  must_address:
    - "Define clear quantity targets: minimum best practices per topic and total snapshots"
    - "Clarify dependency on Story 1.6 or remove if this can run independently"
    - "Add completion criteria to ACs (e.g., 'at least 40 best practices documented')"

  should_address:
    - "Create validation script to check Markdown structure, required sections, citation format"
    - "Define quality criteria for 'proven vs experimental' effectiveness ratings"
    - "Add automated checks for required metadata fields in all documents"
    - "Consider web scraping for snapshot marketplaces to reduce manual effort"

  nice_to_have:
    - "Add maintenance schedule or expiration dates to best practices"
    - "Create template files to speed up curation"
    - "Add automated link checking for source citations"
    - "Consider involving domain experts for content review"

decision: |
  ⚠️ CONCERNS - Story 2.3 needs clarification before development.

  This is primarily a manual content curation story with vague acceptance criteria.
  Major issues:
  1. No clear quantity targets (how many best practices? how many snapshots?)
  2. No completion criteria (when is "documented" or "compiled" satisfied?)
  3. No automation or tooling support (entirely manual, time-intensive)
  4. Limited testability (quality validation is subjective)
  5. Unclear dependencies (why does this depend on Story 1.6?)

  This story can proceed with clarifications:
  - Define minimum content targets (e.g., 40 best practices, 40 snapshots)
  - Add validation scripts for Markdown structure and required fields
  - Clarify or remove Epic 1 dependency
  - Consider running this in parallel with Epic 1 as it's independent content work

  Recommendation: Have Product Owner clarify scope and acceptance criteria before starting development.
