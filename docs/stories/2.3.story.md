# Story 2.3: Best Practices & Snapshot Reference Curation

## Status
Complete

## Story
**As a** knowledge curator,
**I want** curated best practices and snapshot marketplace information indexed,
**so that** users get expert guidance on workflows, SaaS mode, and snapshot selection.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Minimum 40 best practices** documented covering: lead nurturing (8), appointment automation (8), form optimization (6), SaaS setup (6), workflow patterns (6), funnel optimization (6)
2. **Minimum 30 snapshot profiles** compiled from: Extendly (15), GHL Central (10), Official Marketplace (5)
3. Each snapshot profile includes all required fields: name, features, pricing, use cases, reviews, requirements
4. Files saved to `kb/best-practices/` and `kb/snapshots-reference/` with organized subdirectories
5. Content formatted in structured Markdown following templates exactly
6. **All sources cited using standardized format:** `[Source Type] Author/Site Name - "Title" (Date) - URL`
7. Validation script passes 100% (checks structure, required fields, citation format)
8. Total estimated curation time: 16-20 hours (documented in Dev Notes)

## Dependencies

**Depends on Story 1.6 (KB Directory Structure Setup)**
**Justification:** This story requires the `kb/best-practices/` and `kb/snapshots-reference/` directories to be created with proper structure and documentation. Story 1.6 establishes the complete knowledge base directory layout, README files, and organizational standards that this story must follow. Without Story 1.6 complete, curation would lack a standardized structure and could result in rework.

**Blocks:** Story 2.4 (Semantic Chunking) - chunks best practices and snapshot content
**Blocks:** Story 2.5 (Embedding Generation) - embeds curated content into vector DB

3. **Citation format:**
   - Matches standardized format exactly
   - URL is valid and accessible
   - Date is in YYYY-MM-DD format

4. **Output:**
   - Validation report with pass/fail for each file
   - List of errors with file:line references
   - Summary statistics

**Usage:**
```bash
npm run validate:curated
# or
node scripts/validate-curated-content.js
