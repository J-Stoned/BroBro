# Story 4.5: Advanced Feature Slash Commands

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** GHL user,
**I want** slash commands for SaaS mode and snapshots,
**so that** I can configure advanced GHL features correctly.

2. `/ghl-snapshot [use-case]` - Snapshot marketplace guidance with recommendations
3. Commands search `ghl-best-practices` and `ghl-snapshots` collections
