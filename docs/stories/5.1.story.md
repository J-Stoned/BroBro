# Story 5.1: Knowledge Base Quality Validation

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** quality engineer,
**I want** to validate knowledge base accuracy and search relevance,
**so that** users receive correct and helpful answers.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Semantic search benchmark: 50 test queries with expected results
2. Search relevance score: 90%+ for top-3 results across test queries
3. Source attribution validated: all results include correct doc/video citations
4. Chunk coherence review: manual inspection of 100 random chunks
5. Missing content check: verify coverage of major GHL features (workflows, funnels, API, SaaS)
6. Tutorial quality review: validate 10 random YouTube transcripts for accuracy
7. Test report generated with benchmark results and improvement recommendations
