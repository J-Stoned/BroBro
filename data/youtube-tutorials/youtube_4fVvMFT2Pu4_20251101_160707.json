Audience segments basically enable users to create manage and target audiences directly within the platform. This release introduces end toend audience management. So, from segment creation to ad manager settings to seamless integration with the campaign builder, all of that is in there to ensure better reach, personalization, and campaign performance. Um, so a couple of things here. Obviously um audience segments are in there under ads manager setting Google ads centralized section to create and view your audiences and manage them. You can also support multiple segments. So you can do customer match, website visitors, interest segments, lookalike segments. So these are all the uh the different audience types that Google has. You can obviously go in and upload files. If it's like a customer match, you can upload right within the platform to create it, which is awesome. Um, in the intended audience section uh of the Google Ads campaign flow, you can now select existing segments, create new ones uh and and all the things that you would expect from uh doing it inside ads manager itself, which is really cool. Enhanced targeting experience, so you improved uh intended audience UI, all of that.
