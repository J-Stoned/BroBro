  "transcript": "Hey, happy Friday everybody. Sean coming at you from high level. So, the WhatsApp team have just been crushing it. Yesterday we had the global release of uh coexistence. Uh and today we are releasing countdown timers in WhatsApp messages. So, check this out. Basically, you can go in, add a button in your WhatsApp template, and link to a fixed recurring or dynamic timer or create a new timer on the fly. And when recipients click that, they'll land on an active or expired page based on the timer status. So, you can see kind of over here, you can just click this uh quick reply buttons, hit countdown timer. Uh and then when you do that, you can choose either which timer that you you want, which is already exists, or you can create a new one. Uh of course, and you can see right here, WhatsApp message is sent or delivered. So you can trigger it dynamically. So you can choose when to fire off the the timer, right? So like if it's like when the message delivered or sent. So that's easy. Uh and then of course, if you need to edit it, you can. And of course, what's the benefit here? You can see right here, limited time offer just for you. We're excited offer. Offer valid until the timer ends. And it um and so it really gets people moving and hopping uh to get after your offer. So it's very cool that they got this done. Uh let's see. That should be it's just sort of like one of the quick actions that's uh available for WhatsApp. So it shouldn't need too much explanation beyond that. But if you need anything, just uh hit up the help docs for WhatsApp uh how to create WhatsApp messages and how to create uh quick action. So anyways, on that note, I hope you're having an amazing Friday and I'll see you in the next video. Thanks.",
