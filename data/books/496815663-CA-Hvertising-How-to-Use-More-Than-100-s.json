It’s dumb.\nBoring. Weak. Not worth the paper it’s printed on.\nAm I angry? No. Realistic? Y es. But don’t just take my word for it.\nLook in your trash can. How much of the nonsense you get in the mailwinds up there before you open it? How much of what you do open\nends up in the same place before you finish reading the first few lines?How many TV commercials have convinced you to buy? How manye-mails have persuaded you to spend money? How many Websites havebored you to tears?\nI rest my case.\nThe Bottom Line: The Goal of\nAdvertising Is to Get People to Act\nWhether you want them to ask for more details, shoot you some\ncash via PayPal, or whip out their Visa, it’s action  that makes advertising\npay off. Because advertising is not journalism. It’s not news reporting.\nAs a journalist, your job is to report what happened. You don’t needpeople to respond to succeed. Your primary interest is that they’re ac-curately informed and somewhat entertained.\nWhen you write advertising , on the other hand, you want people to\ndo more than just read. You want them to do more than simply say,\na06 cash pref.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 11\nCA$HVERTISING\n12“Wow...great ad!” and then toss it into the kitchen trash on top of the\ngrapefruit skins. No. You want people to act now , to place an order or\nrequest information that’s designed to persuade them to order. Let’snot kid each other, we advertise for one reason: to make money. Period.\nDo you know why most advertising today is so lousy? It’s because\nmost people in advertising today don’t know a damned thing aboutwhat makes people buy. Believe it or not, it’s true. They like to be cutesyand clever. They like to win awards for creativity that do nothing morethan boost their egos and waste thousands of dollars for their clients.Most advertisers (and their agencies) don’t know how to capture people’simagination, and make them want to open up their wallets and spend\nmoney. When I asked my mentor, advertising great Walter Weir, “Why ismost advertising today so lousy—even the ads put out by giant andsuccessful companies?” He replied in his deep, radio announcer-likevoice, “Drew, they simply don’t know any better.”\nThat’s why I wrote this book. To pierce the veil of silly nonsense and\ncostly myths. To pull off the blinders worn by so many well-meaningbut terribly misinformed businesspeople who are scratching their headswondering why their crippled horses—their poorly constructed ads,brochures, sales letters, e-mails, and Websites—aren’t winning races.\nNinety-nine percent of advertising\ndoesn’t sell much of anything.\n—David Ogilvy, founder,\nOgilvy & Mather Advertising Agency\nHow to Read This Book:\nAdvice From the Masters\nSome time ago, an American reporter traveled to Tibet to interview\na wise old Zen master. When the two sat down for tea, instead of lettingthe Zen master do the talking, the reporter began to brag about all thethings he knew about life!\nThe guy ranted on and on while the master poured the reporter’s\ntea. As he endlessly babbled, the tea quickly rose to the rim of his cupand began spilling all over the floor. The reporter finally stopped yak-king and said with surprise, “What are you doing? You can’t pour inany more! The cup is overflowing!”\na06 cash pref.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 12\nPreface\n13“Y es,” responded the wise master. “This teacup, like your mind, is\nso full of ideas that there is no room for new information. You must firstempty your head before any new knowledge can enter.”\nBe open to new ideas, but do not believe  what I tell you.\nDon’t either believe  or disbelieve  what you read in this book. I don’t\neven want you to accept what I say as the best way. And, most of all,\nplease don’t read this book and then say, “Wow! Drew Eric Whitmanreally knows his stuff!” and then sit down with a bag of chips and watchSeinfeld  reruns.\nMere belief in these ideas won’t put cash in your pockets. Belief\nalone won’t put food on your table, clothes on your back, or a new carin your driveway. Instead, I want you to experience  the results of using\nthe techniques I share with you. Experience how your business andbank account grow. Experience the thrill of having an ever-increasingnumber of people hand you cash, write you checks, debit their creditcards, and pump up your PayPal account. How? By putting these prin-\nciples into action.\nNo matter what you sell, I hope this book helps you succeed. If one\nday you can attribute even a tiny percentage of your success to whatI’ve taught you, I will have succeeded as well.\na06 cash pref.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 13\na06 cash pref.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 14\n15Introduction\nWould you like to learn dozens of little-known principles and tech-\nniques of advertising psychology used by the world’s highest-paid copy-writers and designers?\nIf you said yes, this book will open a whole new world for you. It will\nteach you secrets known only to the masters of persuasion, the ad-agencyexperts who know how to tap into people’s innermost desires, and in-fluence them to spend money. It will teach you what to do and how todo it.\nBottom line:  This book will help you make more money.\nAnd it doesn’t matter if you sell aardvarks or zwieback cookies. Be-\ncause I’m going to teach you—right here in these fast-moving pages—how to tap into the minds of your prospects like a highly paid consumerpsychologist; like a supremely skilled ad-agency copywriter who knows(and uses) all the tricks of the trade to influence consumers to readtheir offers, and respond by pulling out their wallets.\nPersuasion and Influence\nNow, if these two words scare you, stop reading here . Really. It means\nthis book is not for you. (I just used a technique on you. Keep readingand I’ll teach you how to use it too.) You see, to many, these wordsconjure up thoughts of evildoers out to take advantage of the poor,unsuspecting public.\na07 cash intro.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 15\nCA$HVERTISING\n16Advertising is only evil when it advertises evil things.\n—David Ogilvy\nThe truth is, you and I are influenced by these techniques every\nday. And when used properly to advertise quality products and services,it’s perfectly legal, ethical, and moral.\nQuestion:  When you walk into a car dealership, do you really think\nyou’re simply having an everyday chat with the sales rep? Sorry, you’renot. A skilled salesperson is a master in psychological communicationstrategies. Chances are, you are not. And it’s the salesperson’s goal to\nmove you from “looker” to “buyer.”\nYou see, while you’re shooting the breeze, admiring the beautiful,\nshiny paint, breathing in the aromatic leather upholstery, and droolingover the 550-horsepower engine, that “nice” salesperson is reading youlike a book.\nLike it or not, he’s pulling you through a series of deliciously per-\nsuasive steps that are rapidly and continually being tailored to yourevery response— and you’re not even noticing! (Why did I just say pulling\nyou rather than taking you ? Was it intentional? Oh yes. I’ll explain in\ndetail, later in this book.) If you say A, he’ll say B. If instead you say C,he’ll jump to D. There’s little you can do to surprise him. He’s seen itall before.\nListen:  His goal is not to be your friend. It’s also not to whittle away\nhis day with pleasant chatter. His goal is for you to sign a hardcore,legally binding contract—the act that puts money in his pocket andfood on his table.\nBut don’t be alarmed: That’s what sales is all about, of course! And\nif you’re happy with your purchase, maybe you’ll buy your next carfrom him. (Chances are he won’t have to work as hard the second time.)\nLikewise, advertising’s purpose is not to entertain, but to persuade\nconsumers to part with billions of dollars every day in exchange forproducts and services. And much like you in that car dealership, mostconsumers know nothing about the intensive research and psychologi-cal methodology that lies behind those ads! Guess what. They’re notsupposed to.\nThose commercials you see and hear on TV and radio are more\nthan just a collection of words and sounds. They are elegant amalgams\na07 cash intro.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 16\nIntroduction\n17of communication strategies designed to move you from your current\nmindset of a looker to that of a buyer.\nDid you know that teams of skilled consumer psychologists rou-\ntinely consult with ad agencies to help them construct ads that power-fully affect consumers on a psychological, even subconscious level? It’strue! But don’t be alarmed…that’s what advertising is all about! And ifyou’re happy with your purchase, maybe you’ll buy again.\nYou see, advertising is a subset of communication.Sales is a subset of advertising.\nPersuasion is a subset of sales.\nAnd psychology is a subset of persuasion.Each is a form of the other, and it all leads back to psychology: the\nstudy of the human mind.\n“But I just want to keep the good citizens informed, Drew! I don’t\nwant to influence or persuade anyone!” Hogwash! And I’ll prove it.\nLet’s assume you own a pizza shop. (The same holds true no matter\nwhat kind of business you operate: real estate, physician, attorney, roofer,Web consultant, contractor, whatever.) If you really  don’t want to per-\nsuade anyone, then why aren’t you running ads that simply state whatyou sell, the price, and your address, Website, and phone number, likethis:\nGIUSEPPE SELLS PIZZA: $9.99. 123 Mozzarella Road.\nwww.BigCheeseDisk.com (800)123-4567.\nYou wouldn’t do it on your life! Why not? I’ll tell you.\nBecause you don’t dare want the prospects to make up their own\nminds as to whether or not they want to buy your pizzas. You’d muchrather make their minds up for them! (That’s persuasion.) You’d rathertell them how to feel about your pizza. (That’s influence.) The result\nbeing that they buy, buy, buy. (The end result of that persuasion andinfluence.)\nStudying psychology to boost the effectiveness of your ads isn’t evil.\nIt simply teaches you:\n1. What people want.\n2. How they feel about what they want.\n3. Why they act as they do.\na07 cash intro.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 17\nCA$HVERTISING\n18And once you know this, you can:\n1. Better understand how to satisfy your customers.\n2. Influence more people to buy.\n3. Get your quality products into more people’s hands.\n4. Help add more satisfaction to their lives.\nSee? It’s not so bad after all, is it? Not if you start with a quality\nproduct. Of course, influencing more people to buy a crummy productthat typically self-destructs within the first week of ownership is some-thing else. You don’t need psychology. You need a shot of ethics.\nAbove all, if you suffer from being too timid in your advertising—as\nare most advertisers today—this book will give you a giant boot in thepants. Ready to dig in? Let’s go!\na07 cash intro.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 18\n19\nCHAPTER 1\nBorn in 1883, Daniel Starch was considered the nation’s leading\nadverti sing and marketing psychologist. His publication Starch Advertising\nReadership Reports  opened people’s eyes wide. Why? Because his writ-\nings showed advertisers how much money they were flushing downthe toilet.\n“Think your ad is great?” he said, in so many words, to big maga-\nzine advertisers around the country. “Your ‘oh-so-great’ ads are ignoredby more than half of everyone who reads the magazines!” he blasted.\n“How could this be?” the ad men puzzled. “Our ads are marvelous...they\nshow our entire factory, and all our wonderful equipment from severalreally unusual camera-angles, and tell about our incredible products!”\nStarch blasted them again: “Guess what guys? People couldn’t care\nless about your smoke-belching factories! They don’t give a damn  about\nhow many people you have on staff, or how many square feet your com-pany occupies. And they don’t give a flying flounder how fancy yourequipment is, or your— gasp! —’unusual camera angles,’ or any of that\nother self-serving junk!”\nInstead, Starch’s research showed that people care mostly about is\n(get ready for this earth-shaking revelation)... themselves !\nThey care about what products will do for them, how they’ll make\ntheir lives better, happier, more fulfilled. What a revelation! But isn’tWhat People Really Want\nb01 cash ch 1.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 19\nCA$HVERTISING\n20this common sense? Doesn’t every advertiser know this today? Ha! How\nfoolish of us to think so.\nJust look around you. Look at today’s newspaper and magazine\nads. Check out TV and radio commercials. Surf the Web and look inyour e-mail in-box. You’ll find that what you and I might think wascommon sense...is apparently not.\nDecades have passed since Daniel Starch issued his initial findings.\nY esterday’s advertising researchers are probably screaming from theirgraves today: “Haven’t you learned a thing?! We dedicated years to re-\nsearching how to make your bank accounts grow like Jack’s freakybeanstalk. Open your eyes! ”\nSigh. It’s frustrating. The truth is, they haven’t learned a thing.\nMost (yes, most) of today’s advertisers still haven’t learned the basiclesson: people don’t care about you, they care first about themselves.\nIn 1935, H.E. Warren wrote an article entitled “How to Understand\nWhy People Buy,” which every advertiser and salesperson should readtwice. He said:\nTo understand why people buy, we...should know people\nand have a keen sense of human nature. We should knowhow people think...how people live, and be acquainted withthe standards and customs affecting their everyday lives....We should fully know their needs and their wants and beable to distinguish between the two. An understanding ofwhy people buy is gained by a willingness to acquire provedand tested principles of commercial psychology to selling.\nOkay, enough background. Let’s jump in. First, I’ll teach you the 17\nfoundational principles of consumer psychology. Once you understandhow they work, I’ll teach you 41 easy-to-use, little-known response-boost ing advertising techniques. Many of these will incorporate one or\nmore of the 17 principles, and others will introduce you to psychologi-cal theories specific to advertising writing and design. Best of all, I’ll tellyou how to use them in your own promotions to help light a fire underyour sales curve.\nForget everything else. Here’s what people really  want.\nConsumer researchers and psychologists know what people want.\nThey should—they’ve studied the subject for years. And although allresearchers don’t agree completely with every finding, there are eightfoundational “desires” common to everyone.\nb01 cash ch 1.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 20\nWhat People Really Want\n21I call them the Life-Force 8  (LF8 for short). These eight powerful\ndesires are responsible for more sales than all other human wants com-bined. Here they are. Learn them. Use them. Profit from them.\nThe Life-Force 8\nHuman beings are biologically programmed  with the following eight\ndesires:\n1. Survival, enjoyment of life, life extension.\n2. Enjoyment of food and beverages.3. Freedom from fear, pain, and danger.\n4. Sexual companionship.\n5. Comfortable living conditions.6. To be superior, winning, keeping up with the Joneses.\n7. Care and protection of loved ones.\n8. Social approval.Who could argue with these things? We all want them, don’t we?\nBut in how many of your ads do you openly use an appeal to one or\nmore of the LF8? I bet few, if any. Why am I such a doubting Thomas?Simply because it’s unlikely that anyone ever taught you to do so.\nListen:  When you create an advertising appeal based on any of the\nLF8, you tap into the power of Mother Nature herself. You tap into thevery essence of what makes humans tick. You see, you can’t escape yourdesires for the LF8. You were born with them, and they’ll be with youuntil the day you die. For example:\n✸Can you shake your desire to eat? (LF8 #2)\n✸Can you suppress your will to survive? (LF8 #1)\n✸How easily can you quash your desire for physical\ncomfort? (LF8 #5)\n✸Can you stop caring whether or not your child looks both\nways before crossing the street? (LF8 #7)\nYou don’t need to conduct studies to answer these questions; the\nanswers are obvious. These desires are biologically programmed  in each\nof us. They’re part of what makes us human. They’re powerful motiva-tors. And smart advertisers can tap into them like pushing a plug intoan outlet.\nb01 cash ch 1.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 21\nCA$HVERTISING\n22What Can You Learn About\nDesire From a Master Bookseller?\nWhen it came to making big money selling books, mail order guru\nHaldeman-Julius wrote  the book. During the 1920s and ’30s he sold\nmore than 200 million of them, in nearly 2,000 different titles. Theywere simple little books, and they all cost just 5 cents each. To advertisehis books, he placed ads consisting of only the books’ titles. If a bookdidn’t sell well, he’d change the ad copy, but not the way you’d expect.He actually changed the titles of the books! Then he’d sit back andstudy the response. How clever.\nLook what happened when the titles were changed based on the LF8.\nAccording to Haldeman-Julius, the two strongest appeals were sex\nand self-improvement . Surprised? Neither am I. So again I ask you: How\nmany of your current ads contain either of these appeals? When you tap\ninto these innate desires, you harness the unstoppable momentum ofthe emotions that drive people every second of every day.Casanova and\nHis LovesOld T itle Annual Sales New T itleAnnual Sales\n& LF8 Affected\nTen O’Clock\nFleece of Gold\nArt of Controversy\nApothegems2,000\n5,000\n0\n8,000\n2,000What Art Should\nMean to You\nQuest for a\nBlonde Mistress\nHow to Argue\nLogically\nCasanova, History’s\nGreatest Lover\nTruth About the\nRiddle of Life9,000 (LF#8)\n50,000 (LF#4)\n30,000 (LF#6)\n22,000 (LF#4)\n9,000 (LF#1)\nb01 cash ch 1.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 22\nWhat People Really Want\n23People buy because of emotion and justify\nwith logic. Force an emotional response by\ntouching on a basic want or need.\n—“Seven Principles of Stopping Power,”\nThe Young & Rubicam Traveling Creative Workshop\nThe Nine Learned\n(Secondary) Human Wants\nPerhaps you read the list of eight primary wants and thought, “Heck,\nI want more than just these eight things!” Of course you do. We havemany other wants. We want to look good, and be healthy, well educated,effective, and so on. (Don’t you?) These are called secondary , or learned\nwants , and nine have been identified:\n1. To be informed.\n2. Curiosity.3. Cleanliness of body and surroundings.\n4. Efficiency.\n5. Convenience.6. Dependability/quality.\n7. Expression of beauty and style.\n8. Economy/profit.9. Bargains.\nThese secondary wants are strong, but they don’t even come close\nto the LF8. They’re way in the background, completely clouded by yourLF8 dust. We’re not born with these secondary wants. We learned  them.\nThey’re not hard-wired in our brains as are the LF8. Used as tools ofinfluence, they’re not as bankable as the LF8 because we’re not biologi-cally driven to satisfy them. (Read that again.) And when it comes tohuman desires, biology is king. There’s nothing more powerful thantapping into a desire that you can’t shake. It’s like jumping onto a speed-ing train: Once you’re on, you don’t need to lift a finger to get it mov ing—\nyou’re already flying along!\nThink about it. Which desire would you respond to first: to buy a\nnew shirt, or to run out of a burning building? If you’re single, wouldyou be more driven to organize your desk or have amazing sex with thehottie whose been flirting with you at lunch every day? Would you first\nb01 cash ch 1.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 23\nCA$HVERTISING\n24protect your spouse from a crazed attacker, or ignore the assault and\ninstead go shopping for wallpaper for your guest bathroom? The an-swers are obvious. And the interesting thing about the LF8 is that wedon’t even know—or ever question—these desires. We simply want\nthem—no, we must have them. We can’t shake them no matter what we\ndo. Again, they’re hardwired into us. These examples should give you abetter idea why the LF8 are so powerful, and why using them in yourads can be so effective:  You’ll be tapping into the human psyche, thecore programming of the human brain itself.\nBut what exactly is desire? It’s a type of tension you feel when a\nneed isn’t met. If you’re hungry, for example, the tension to eat arisesand the desire for food (LF8 #2) kicks in. If you see a creepy-lookingmiddle-aged guy chatting online with your 8-year-old daughter, thetension to protect your child arises and your desire to start monitoringher internet usage (LF8 #7) kicks in. If your office chair breaks yourback after just 10 minutes of use, the tension to be comfortable arises,and your desire to buy a new chair (LF8 #5) kicks in.\nSo here’s the simple formula for desire, and the result it sets in motion:\nTension ÆÆÆÆÆ Desire ÆÆÆÆÆ Action to Satisfy the Desire\nIn short, when you appeal to people’s LF8 desires, you create a\ndrive that motivates them to take an action that will fulfill that desire assoon as possible.\nNow here’s an especially interesting fact, of particular importance\nto us advertisers. Not only is it pleasant for us to satisfy our eight pri-mary desires, but it’s also pleasant for us to read about how others  have\nsatisfied them. It’s a form of vicarious LF8 desire fulfillment. Fascinat-ing, isn’t it?\nFor example, by reading how consumer George Vincent was able to\npay off all his debts using a radical new approach to real estate invest-ing, you and I—on the giant projector screen of our minds—envision abrilliantly clear, superbly detailed account of ourselves  paying off all our\nbills, laughing as we dash off checks to our creditors in a devil-may-care\nfashion, leaning back in our big leather chair, throwing our feet up onour desk, and enjoying a debt-free, piles-of-cash-in-the-bank lifestyle.\nSounds great, doesn’t it? But did you see what I just did? By using\nlanguage that’s both specific and visual , I was able to install a mental\nmovie  inside your head. We’ll explore these mental movies in more de-\ntail in Chapter 3, in  Ad Agency Secret #18: Directing Mental Movies.\nb01 cash ch 1.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 24\nWhat People Really Want\n25But for now, just know that by using specific visual words, you can give\nyour audience a sense of what it’s like to actually interact with yourproduct or enjoy the benefits of your service—to demonstrate its useinside their minds—long before they actually buy it. This vicarious plea-sure is where the persuasion begins, because the first use of any product is\ninside the consumers’ minds . (Stop. Read that last sentence again.) Imag-\nining the use of something that appeals to you increases your desire for it.\nFor example, let’s say you love ice cream. If you spend all afternoon\nthinking about ordering a giant hot fudge sundae at dinner with threegiant scoops of Guittard mint chocolate chip, two big ladles of steam-ing, extra-dark hot fudge, chopped wet nuts, all blanketed in a cloud offluffy whipped cream with a maraschino cherry on top, you’re naturallygoing to want it more than if you hadn’t thought about it. And ultimately—\nif that desire is strong enough—you’ll take some form of action thatresults in your having mint chocolate chip ice cream, hot fudge, choppednuts, and a maraschino  cherry floating around in your stomach. (And\nperhaps some in your lap, too, if you’re particularly exuberant whileeating it.)\nAgain, notice how my choice of words causes you to imagine ice\ncream, nuts, steaming-hot fudge and a bright red cherry floating inyour stomach. If I instead said, “you’ll take some form of action thatresults in your having eaten it,” your mental movie screen would have—POOF! —gone blank. And—this is critical—the less imagery you con-\nvey, the less your message occupies consumers’ brains, the less likely itis that you’ll influence them. Let me drive this point home with an-other example.\nLet’s look at transforming a bland sentence with no imagery power\ninto a Hollywood blockbuster. The bland sentence is: “Go somewhereand do something.” Y awn. Each successive variation of this sentencewill build in visual intensity, not simply because we add words and sen-tences, but because the words I use are intentionally selected to installmental movies—visuals—in your head.\n✸Go somewhere and do something. (This is a blank movie\nscreen. No imagery.)\n✸Go somewhere and get something. ( Do can mean anything.\nGet is more specific.)\n✸Go to the kitchen  and get something. (Still vague, but now\nyou know where to go.)\nb01 cash ch 1.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 25\nCA$HVERTISING\n26✸Go to the kitchen and get food. (Ahh, now we’re getting\nsomewhere. Do you see how filling in the details createsimagery?)\n✸Go to the kitchen, open the oven , and get food. (Notice how\nyou pictured yourself opening an oven. Specific wordingimplants images. Action words create moving pictures.)\n✸Go to the kitchen, open the oven, and pull out the pizza.\n(Very visual. A picture of a pizza pops into your head,whether you want it to or not! See the power of this? Youcan’t help but picture what I write about, if I use specificvisual words.)\n✸Go to the kitchen, open the oven, and pull out the freshest,\ncrispiest, most delicious hot pizza you’ve ever eaten. Goon, cut yourself a big, hearty slice. Careful, it’s hot! Nowtake a big bite. Talk about crisp! The dough was made freshthis morning and baked in a virgin olive oil–coated blackpan for a thick, deep-dish Chicago style crust. The sauce?Prepared from scratch, of course, from juicy plum toma-toes picked this morning, and blended with select freshherbs from our own garden. Cheese? You betcha! Lots andlots of chewy, whole-milk mozzarella, made from the finestbuffalo milk, of course, and the entire pie baked to bub-bling perfection in a 750-degree wood-burning brick ovenimported from Genoa, Italy. (Okay, I really maxed out thisone to prove my point. And chances are you experienced arich and detailed series of images by simply reading mywords.)\nWe’ll talk more about this whole business of using positive visual\nadjectives in Ad Agency Secret #17: PVAs—The Easy Way to Boost thePower of Your Copy. But for now, to sum up this chapter, just be awareof these five things:\n1. People have eight basic wants—the LF8 (survival; food and\ndrink; freedom from fear, pain, and danger; sexual com-panionship; comfortable living conditions; to be superior;care and protection of loved ones; and social approval).\n2. The strongest advertising appeals are based on these eight\nbasic wants.\nb01 cash ch 1.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 26\nWhat People Really Want\n273. The most effective way to create an appeal based on these\neight wants is to write ad copy that causes your prospectsto visually  demonstrate your product or service inside their\nheads, sufficiently enough to build desire for the satisfac-tion of the want(s) that your product promises toprovide...and then to choose your product to attain it.\n4. Now that you’ve got them wanting fulfillment, your next\njob is to influence them to believe that your product actu-ally delivers what you say. It’s credibility  time, and we’ll dis-\ncuss this in Ad Agency Technique #15: The Psychology of“Social Proof,” and Ad Agency Technique #33: Guaran-tees that Guarantee Higher Response.\n5. They believe you. They want it. Yippee! Time to count your\nmoney, right? Wrong!  You now have to push them to act.\nWe’ll discuss how to do this in Ad Agency Technique #19:Battling Human Inertia. And I’ll give you a slew of quicktips in the following Chapter 4 Hot List sections: “22 Re-sponse Superchargers,” “13 Ways to Make Buying Easy,”and “11 Ways to Boost Coupon Returns.”\nLet’s now look at the 17 foundational principles of consumer psy-\nchology. In Chapter 2, I teach you what they are, why they work, andhow you can use them to help sell your products and services.\nb01 cash ch 1.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 27\nb01 cash ch 1.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 28\n29\nCHAPTER 2\nPrinciple #1: The Fear Factor—\nSelling the Scare\nFact: Your home is a cesspool filled with hundreds of strains of evil\nbacteria waiting to infect your innocent child as he crawls along thekitchen floor, sticking plastic toy blocks into his mouth. Don’t laugh.Did you know that one single bacteria cell explodes into more than 8million  cells in less than 24 hours? And that invisible microbes of all\nkinds can cause everything from athlete’s foot to diarrhea, the commoncold to the flu, meningitis, pneumonia, sinusitis, skin diseases, strepthroat, tuberculosis, urinary tract infections, and a lot more.\nThe solution? Lysol® Disinfectant Spray. It quickly kills 99.9 per-\ncent of germs on commonly touched surfaces throughout the home.And it’s only about $5 a can.\nFact: No matter how often you wash your sheets, your bed is an\ninsect breeding ground, teeming with thousands of hideous, crab-likedust mites aggressively laying eggs in your pillow and mattress, causingyou and your family to suffer year-long allergy attacks. While you sleep,they actually wake up and start to crawl, eat your skin flakes, and drinkthe moisture on your flesh. It gets worse.  Did you know that  10 percent\nof the weight of a two-year-old pillow is actually dead mites and theirfeces? This means that every night you and your family are sleeping inHow to Get Inside Their Heads:\nThe 17 Foundational Principles of\nConsumer Psychology\nb02 cash ch 2.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 29\nCA$HVERTISING\n30the equivalent of an insect’s toilet, actually covered in a mélange of both\ntheir living and dead bodies, and oceans of their bitter excrement.\nThe solution?

Thespecial fabric’s tightly crafted pores don’t allow microscopic mites toenter your mattress, nest, and breed. Your family enjoys a more peace-ful night’s rest. And they’re so affordable: Bloxem anti-mite mattresscovers are just $60, and pillow cases are less than $10 each. They’reavailable from dozens of fine Internet retailers.\nFact: Your dog could be the next victim of the horrible groomer’s\nnoose! This hangman-like contraption is designed to keep Fluffy onthe table while she’s getting her haircut. It’s perfectly safe—that is, ifshe doesn’t step off the edge! One wrong step and she’d snap her necklike an old-west bandit swinging from branches of the hangman’s tree.\nThe solution? Call Vanity ’n‘ Fur groomers, where we use loving\nkindness to beautify your doggie, never dangerous mechanicalcontraptions—like the groomer’s noose—that less-experienced groom-ers risk using everyday.\nBottom line:  Fear sells.  It motivates. It urges. It moves people to\naction. It drives them to spend money. In fact, social psychologists andconsumer researchers have been studying its effects for more than 50years. Whether it’s selling a loaf of bread, which hardly seems scary(until you show them studies reporting that refined white flour maycause cancer), or painting a picture of doom and gloom about the in-sidious nature of odorless carbon monoxide creeping through air con-ditioning vents and wiping out their family (while they’re sleeping safely\nin a hotel on a business trip), properly constructed, fear can move peopleto spend.\nBut why does it work? In a word: stress. Fear causes stress. And stress\ncauses the desire to do something. Missing a big sale causes the stress ofloss. Choosing the right tires can cause the stress of concern for per-sonal safety. Not opting for the side-curtain airbags in your new carcauses the stress of future regret and visions of physical injury. Fearsuggests loss. Fear paints a picture of necessary response. It tells yourprospect that he or she will be somehow damaged. This threatens theego’s continuous quest for self-preservation. Therefore, the threat ofbeing damaged is insidious and powerful.\nCan you use it for your products and services? Y es...if your product\noffers the appropriate solution for a fearful situation. But is it ethical?\nb02 cash ch 2.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 30\nHow to Get Inside Their Heads\n31Y es, but only if what you’re selling offers a truly effective solution.\nCertain products can quell fears. And there’s nothing wrong with\npromot ing—and profiting—from them.\n“Oh, Drew...that’s so manipulative! Scaring people to buy! How could\nyou?”\nIf you thought or said this statement, please read my Introduction\nagain. I said that if using persuasion and influence scares you, you shouldstop reading. That’s because there aren’t enough pages in this book—nor is it my intention—to try to convince you of the morality  of using a\nfear appeal. I mean, what could I possibly say to convince you that it’sokay to use fear when selling your brake pad replacement service? (Isn’tit obvious?) Or life insurance? Home smoke detectors? Cancer insur-ance? The mere mention of these things—to me, anyway—conjures upfearful situations that require some form of self-protection. If that formof self-protection presents itself via an advertiser who happens to beselling a product that can save my life, prevent pain, or otherwise helpme better deal with an unpleasant situation, then I welcome it. I haveno problem being informed, and swiftly moved to take caution. Do you?\nBottom line:  if it’s possible to use fear to effectively sell a product\nor service, it means that inherent in that product or service is the pos-sible resolution to that which is feared. If not, no matter how much fearyou try to conjure up, your appeal will fail miserably. Make sense?\nThe Four-Step Recipe for Inducing Fear\nOkay, so you’ve determined that your product or service can genu-\ninely alleviate a real fear-producing problem and is a good candidate forusing the fear appeal. In order to make it work, there’s a specific, four-ingredient recipe you must follow.\nIn their study, Age of Propaganda  (2001), Pratkanis and Aronson ar-\ngue that, “the fear appeal is most effective when:\n1. It scares the hell out of people.2. It offers a specific recommendation for overcoming the\nfear-aroused threat.\n3. The recommended action is perceived as effective for\nreducing the threat.\n4. The message recipient believes that he or she can\nperform the recommended action.”\nb02 cash ch 2.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 31\nCA$HVERTISING\n32The success or failure of this strategy relies on the existence of all\nfour components. Remove any one of them, and it’s like building your\nown computer and leaving out the hard drive. No matter how muchyou want it to work, it simply won’t compute!\nWhat’s more, if you create too much fear, you could actually scare\nsomeone to inaction , like a deer, staring frozen into the headlights of an\noncoming SUV . Fear can paralyze. And it will motivate your prospect toact only if he believes he has the power to change  his situation. That\nmeans in order to craft an effective fear appeal, your ad must containspecific, believable recommendations  for reducing the threat that are both\ncredible and achievable.\nFor example, let’s say you own a karate school and you’re selling\nself-defense training. You can teach people to walk even the rougheststreets with the confidence of a trained bodyguard, ready to countereven the most vicious attacks by the scariest (and ugliest) thugs walkingthe earth. Fact is, you need to do more than simply present gruesomecrime stats. You must also convince your prospect that it’s within herability—using your system—to fight off an attacker using her bare hands.Ignore this vital step, and all you’ve accomplished is scaring her. Youmust also convince  her, using factors that boost credibility (testimonials,\nvideo demonstrations, free lessons, and other believability boosters thatwe’ll discuss later), and open her mind to the possibility  that your claim\nis true, and that she really can enjoy the benefits you’re promising. (She\nwants  to believe you, because you’re making an appealing claim. It’s\nyour job to help her believe you, and that takes more than simply shout-ing “boo!”)\nThe fear appeal is also more successful if the fears targeted are spe-\ncific and widely recognized . It’s a lot easier to sell your sunscreen because\neveryone  knows the sun can fry you like bacon and turn your skin into a\nmelanoma factory. It’s much tougher to sell laundry detergent that helpsprevent ultraviolet damage to clothing . Why? Because few people are\nconcerned with UV laundry damage. When’s the last time this issuekept you awake ? Although the fear is specific (damage to clothing), it’s\ncertainly not widely recognized.\nListen:  Your goal is not to create new fears, but to tap into existing\nfears, either those on the forefront of consumers’ minds, or those thatrequire a little digging to uncover.\nFor example, take what I affectionately call “germ gel.” You may\nknow it as Purell Instant Hand Sanitizer, the leading brand. I don’t go\nb02 cash ch 2.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 32\nHow to Get Inside Their Heads\n33anywhere without it. In fact, if I leave the house and forget my small\nbottle, I’m thrown into somewhat of a panic. Why is this? GOJO Indus tries—\nthe company that manufactures the germ-quashing goop—first intro-duced Purell to the food service and healthcare industries in 1988.Thinking back to that time—and even before—I don’t recall ever feel-ing creeped out about touching things in public the way I do today.Sure, I was always health conscious; I always washed my hands beforeeating, and throughout the day as needed. I knew germs existed every-where. And yet, the “need” to keep my hands relatively germ-free wassimply not a concern back then. It wasn’t on the forefront of my mind.\nJump ahead to 1997, when Purell hit the consumer market. Aha!\nDid you know that unwashed hands are the leading cause of food con-tamination in restaurants? Hand-washing? What a joke! A 2003 surveysponsored by the American Society of Microbiology (ASM) found thatmany people passing through major U.S. airports don’t wash their handsafter using the public facilities. More than  30 percent of people using\nrestrooms in New York airports, 19 percent of those in Miami’s airport,and 27 percent of air travelers at Chicago’s O’Hare aren’t stopping towash their hands. In a phone survey the same year conducted byWirthlin Worldwide, only 58 percent of people say they wash their handsafter sneezing or coughing, and only 77 percent say they wash theirhands after changing a diaper.\nIn 1972, the Journal of the American Medical Association described\na study wherein they cultured bacteria from 200 coins and bills andfound fecal bacteria and Staphylococcus aureus on 13 percent of coinsand 42 percent of notes. It concluded: “Money is truly dirty.” Heck,visit Purell.com and you’ll see their list of “99.99 Germy Reasons to UsePurell.”\nListerine created a shockwave of paranoia with the distasteful word\nhalitosis  in 1900. The copywriter for antiperspirant Odorno (what a name!)\ncaused ladies to question their “daintiness” with a groundbreaking head-line in the 1919 Ladies Home Journal that read, “In the Curve of a\nWoman’s Arm.” GOJO did the same for bacteria. They made it an issue.\nSomething to think—and fret—about. They instilled fear. And, as aresult, Listerine now boasts an impressive 53 percent market share.Odorno boosted sales 112 percent using that poetic headline (despitecausing 200 women to cancel their subscriptions out of sheer disgust withthe suggestion that they’d need such a product). And today, GOJO’s Purellis the largest-selling brand of instant hand sanitizer, causing count less\nb02 cash ch 2.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 33\nCA$HVERTISING\n34germaphobes to carry the stuff around in their handy travel bottle hold-\ners that attach conveniently to their key chains. (See how they made iteasy to resolve the fear?)\nA common way fear is used to simulate action is via the use of dead-\nlines and scarcity . Phrases and slogans such as limited offer , one-day sale ,\nand while supplies last  have the effect of scaring consumers into believ-\ning that unless they act now, they’ll miss a fantastic opportunity to savemoney, tapping into Human Secondary Want #9. The deadline tacticfollows the guidelines by offering the consumer the means to addressthe “threat” by rushing out to purchase before it’s too late.\nHowever, fear is not a magical wand. It’s not enough to simply scare\nsomeone, say a few nice things about your product, and sit back andwait for an onslaught of orders. Fear is simply one way to motivate yourprospects to investigate your product further. Get it? You still need toconvince  him that your product provides the solution to the fear you just\ninstilled. You still need to persuade  and motivate  him to take action: to\ngrab his wallet, visit your Website, or call your 800 number and placehis order. Don’t fret! I’ll teach you how to do all these things—and muchmore—in Chapter 3, where we discuss 41 advertising-specific techniquesthat incorporate many of the psychological principles we’re now reviewing.\nPrinciple #2: Ego Morphing—\nInstant Identification\nWhen you see the Marlboro man, it’s your ego—not your craving for\npaper tubes stuffed with tobacco—that motivates you to switch brands.\nWhen you see the Victoria’s Secret models with their long, silky hair\nand piercing eyes slinking around in their lacy undergarments, it’s yourego, not your admiration for the directorial style of the commercial, that\nmotivates you to buy the slinkwear.\nThe fact is, you can blame your ego for many of your high credit\ncard bills.\nThe foundation for Ego Morphing and the Vanity Appeal was de-\nscribed by Pratkanis and Aronson ( Age of Propaganda , 1991), when they\nsaid, “By purchasing the ‘right stuff,’ we [the consumer] enhance ourown egos and rationalize away our inadequacies.”\nImagine that! We can actually buy things to make up for what we\nbelieve is a lacking in our personalities. You’ve heard of retail therapy ,\nright? Could it be that we as advertisers are actually performing a\nb02 cash ch 2.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 34\nHow to Get Inside Their Heads\n35function more vital than simply providing people with goods and ser-\nvices? Could it be that we’re actually assisting in our customers’ psy-chological development as well?\nIn reality, this technique allows you to create a certain image, or\nidentity, for a product, in order to appeal to a particular section of theaudience that feels that their personal image and ego either match it orcould be improved by it.\nYour goal is to cause consumers to become so closely associated\nwith the product’s image that it almost becomes a part of their ownidentity; thus, you’re “morphing” their ego to fit your product. By rep-resenting your product through carefully chosen images and personali-ties, you can persuade your prospects that, by purchasing or using yourwares, they’ll immediately become associated with these images andattitudes.\nPersuading this way is not difficult. You don’t have to work hard to\npersuade a woman to want to be sexier and more in control, or for aman to be more powerful, self-confident, and appealing to women. Thesethings are built in, pre-wired into our very being. And because the ma-jority of true prospects for your product already believe they possess the\nideas and values associated with it—or have the desire to develop them(otherwise they wouldn’t be true prospects)—you’re actually tapping\ninto this pre-wiring. Don’t you see? You’re selling an easy route to fulfillwhat we know they already  want more of. And for those who believe they\nalready have it, our product can help them too, by giving them a way toexpress what they feel about themselves to the outside world.\nWhat does all this mean? Simply that you can appeal to your\naudience’s vanity and ego without the need for persuasive ideas or evi-dence by concentrating on showing your prospects the images theywant to see. For example, start noticing how very little persuasive copyis used in ads for luxury goods. They’re “feel good” ads. They presentan image that’s carefully crafted to evoke the emotional response ofdesire —for the item advertised. Here’s an example of the elaborate and\ncomplex purchase decision pattern when such an ad is viewed by a trueprospect:\n“Oooooh, look at these hot-looking girls climbing all over that guy\nwearing those kewl Hollister jeans. I want those jeans.”\nDon’t laugh. That’s about it all it takes. And if it didn’t work, retail-\ners such as Hollister and Abercr ombie & Fitch wouldn’t be spending\na fortune placing such ads. (Nor would Lexus, BMW, Jaguar, and\nb02 cash ch 2.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 35\nCA$HVERTISING\n36high- end-product advertisers of most every kind. Oh, did I mention\nRolls-Royce? Y eah, them too.)\nDoes it work? Consider the perfume and cologne business. Aside\nfrom impregnating paper flaps with their product so people can take awhiff, the only thing these advertisers do to persuade their prospects tobuy is show photos of hot-looking women and men whom we’re sup-posed to believe are customers. The models aren’t even wearing theperfumes and colognes during the photo shoot! So really, 99.9 percentof the ad has nothing to do with the products being promoted. It’s pureimagery. But manufacturers apparently know it works: 2008 colognesales are expected to reach $1.6 billion. Women’s fragrances? Add an-other $3.2 billion.\nAppealing to people’s vanity and ego is most successful when it\nhones in on characteristics that society considers being desirable, suchas physical attractiveness, intelligence, economic success, and sexualprowess. As suggested by Stec and Bernstein’s Balance Theory (1999), if\nconsumers are presented with the “correct” images, people who pos-sess these characteristics will buy them in order to publicize their ego.Those who don’t will purchase them in an attempt to appear  as if they\ndo. Interesting, isn’t it?\nSo think about your product. Does owning or using it suggest quali-\nties that people would want to flaunt? You own a karate school? Thenspotlight the names of the big mixed martial arts stars who work outthere. Then print and sell T-shirts that say “I train with [insert big-name star here].” Instant ego appeal.\nYou’re the most expensive dog groomer in town? Show photos of\nthe rich celebrities who bring in their pooches. Feature Mr. or Ms. Celebstepping out of a limo with a drooling pooch. “Oh, yes...there are plentyof other groomers in town, but pshaw! I only trust the Karringtons  with\nmy Fluffy.”  So snotty, but—BOOM!—instant ego appeal.\nYou’re a printer specializing in high-end stationery and wedding\ninvitations? Brag about the well-known personalities who’ve used yourservices. Huh? You say there are no well-known personalities who’ve\nused your services? That’s an easy fix. Offer to do a free job for a few ofyour favorite local celebs—newscasters, or social and political leaders,for example. When they accept, send them 250 letterheads and enve-lopes on your finest paper...then drop some names as to whose statio-nery you’ve printed. Voila! Instant ego appeal.\nb02 cash ch 2.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 36\nHow to Get Inside Their Heads\n37You’re a security firm? What big companies (that have far more rig-\norous security requirements than your typical prospect) trust you toprotect them? Say, “Why Do More Local Bank Presidents ChooseFortKnox Security to Protect Their Own Homes Than Anyone Else?”And then, the variation: “Why Do More Local Jewelry Store OwnersChoose FortKnox Security to Protect Their Homes Than Anyone Else?”\nGet it? If bank presidents and jewelry store owners trust you to pro-\ntect their family and their biggest investment (their home), then, as theaverage prospect, I’d feel good about hiring you to secure my modest\nhome. Doing so puts me in the company of these discerning execu-tives. Again, instant ego appeal.\nBack to Rolls-Royce.\nQuestion:  Would such a distinguished British automaker—long\nbefore they were gobbled up by BMW and Volkswagen—stoop to en-gaging in such a “manipulative” ploy?\nAnswer:  Is a bullfrog waterproof?\nImagine a full-page magazine ad consisting of little more than one\nlarge photo of what looks like a Manhattan intersection. From our bird’s-eye view, we see a driver patiently waiting for the light to change. Theridiculously shiny black convertible Rolls-Royce with Sir Charles Sykes’sinternationally recognized silvery winged mascot, “The Spirit of Ec stasy,”\ndeclares the owner’s good taste and insistence on excellence. Well dressedin business attire, he appears to be about 55 years old, salt-and-pepperhair, confident and relaxed, an executive of some type, no doubt, think-ing a myriad of “all is right with the world”-type thoughts, staring straightahead. To the left of his car, we see another driver of about the sameage, the entire weight of his head resting in his left hand, looking envi-ously at the driver in the Rolls. Feeling on top of the world just mo-ments before Mr. RR pulled up, he’s now squirming uncomfortably...inhis Mercedes . Match point, game over.\nNot all businesses can use such an ego-driven approach. The na-\nture of all products and services doesn’t dictate such a prescription.Fret not. There are plenty of other techniques that will fit your productor service just fine.\nLike a sharpshooter peering through a rifle scope, the techniques\nwe’ve discussed so far target your prospects’ internal attitudes and in-nate psychological hot buttons. The following technique influencesconsumer behavior by associating products and services with symbolsof authority or reverence.\nb02 cash ch 2.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 37\nCA$HVERTISING\n38Principle #3: Transfer— Credibility by Osmosis\n“I don’t understand!” shouted the advertiser. “That’s the best\ndamned ad I’ve ever written! Look at that beautiful layout! Look at thatgorgeous photo! My price is right and I make it easy for people to order.This newspaper has an excellent circulation so I know I’m reaching myaudience. And,” he continues, “it’s a product that would really helppeople! So why isn’t anyone ordering?”\nThe problem? Nobody believes  him.\nThat’s right. No matter how wonderful your ad, brochure, sales let-\nter, Web page, e-mail, or radio or TV commercial, if your prospects don’tbelieve you, you’ve flushed your ad money down the toilet. Your offermust be credible, or you should expect the same crummy results as our\nfrustrated advertiser friend here.\nTransfer  is a strategy that involves using symbols, images, or ideas—\ncues, if you will—commonly associated with people, groups, or institu-\ntions of authority or respect, in order to persuade your prospect thatyour product or service is in some way acceptably endorsed. And ifsomething is endorsed by a person or group you respect, lights flash,bells ring, your brain spits out “instant credibility!” And if it’s some-thing you want and can afford, you’ll start digging for your Visa card.\nSocialization ensures that most people respect institutions such as\nthe Church, the medical establishment, national agencies, and science.When you incorporate images or symbols from any of these groups intoyour ads, the trust you gain can offset your need to present as rigorousa persuasive argument. The ideal strategy? Get a respected institutionto provide its official endorsement. Doing so instantly transfers theirauthority, sanction, and prestige to your product or service.\nFor example, let’s say you’re not sure which way to vote on a costly\nnew crime bill that’s up on referendum. It sounds good, but you don’tknow if it’ll really make a difference on the street, where it matters most.Alas, a direct mail flyer from the Fraternal Order of Police lands in yourmailbox. It says that they wholeheartedly support the bill and requestyour support in urging your state and local politicians to vote yes on itspassage. Because you’ve always respected the organization, and evendonated a few bucks to it, you’re now far more likely to support thecause. “If the police  like it,” you reason, “it’s good enough for me.” And\nyou’re also likely to think—consciously or otherwise—“I respect the F.O.P .so I’m sure they’ve checked it out thoroughly.

Human inertia, a metaphor for lazi-\nness, leads you to rationalize not doing your own in-depth research. It’s\nas simple as that.\nProactiv  is just one of dozens of acne products being hawked today.\nHowever, it’s the only one featuring singer Jessica Simpson testifying toits effectiveness. To young girls suffering from the skin condition, thisis all the endorsement they need.\nQuaker Oats enjoyed excellent growth of its product ever since it\ntrademarked its first smiling Quaker man logo back in 1877. Unfortu-nately, 113 years later, in 1990, the New England Journal of Medicine  re-\nleased the controversial Sachs study that disputed claims that oats andoat bran could reduce cholesterol. Fortunately, Quaker had alreadylaunched a new campaign featuring actor Wilford Brimley in 1987. Hisdisarming, down-to-earth straight talk and no-nonsense, “high-cred ibility\ndemeanor” proclaimed the virtues of the flattened oats, and Quakerenjoyed a reversal of a 5-year sales decline.\nIf you can’t get a full endorsement—a testimonial, for example—\nyou can achieve similar success by spotlighting readily recognized sym-bols that carry the weight of endorsement.\nConsider the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval. This unassum-\ning oval has instilled pre-purchase confidence in millions of consumerssince 1909. A clever concept, the seal is awarded only to those productswhose ads have been reviewed and accepted for publication in Good\nHousekeeping magazine. The publisher promises a refund or replace-\nment for defective products within two years of purchase. Not only is  this\na great added-value inducement to buy ad space in Good Housekeeping ,\nbut it’s also an ideal example of how a trusted group’s symbol can giveyour prospect a sense of security before whipping out the cash. Just asany other guarantee, it could actually help you close the sale if youconstruct it properly. (More about guarantees later.)\nI recently created a jumbo postcard for a hypnotist client. His pros-\npects aren’t familiar with any hypnosis-industry organizations, but themere addition of the official-looking logo of the National Guild of Hyp notists\nis enough to suggest that my client’s membership in the organizationsuggests the validity of his credentials, experience, and effectiveness. Nowthink. Do they really mean  any of that? Of course not. Your prospects\noften use a peripheral , or noncritical style of think ing. It’s this same “short-\ncut to persuasion” at work when we use symbols that connote—or de note—\nauthority, agreement, acceptance, or recognition. Interest ingly enough, I\nb02 cash ch 2.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 39\nCA$HVERTISING\n40bet not 1 in 100 people who received my client’s postcard had ever\nheard of the National Guild of Hypnotists. But thanks to the peripheralroute to persuasion, it doesn’t matter. It’s all most consumers need forthe added boost of confidence they need.\nTo simplify, here’s what happens. Your prospects: 1) See a symbol of\ncredibility (logo, endorsement, and the like), and then (2) question lessof your sales argument.\nUsing generally accepted images of medical and scientific authority\ncould also produce the transfer effect. Studies performed by the Insti tute\nfor Propaganda Analysis suggest that from the simple image of an “ex-pert” in a white lab coat showing medical stats, advertisers can tap thepublic’s acceptance of physicians to influence consumer behavior, ei-ther for or against a product. Is it any wonder that so many ads forhealth products feature dignified-looking men in white lab jackets? In-stant credibility! These advertisers know that you’ll likely transfer  your\nfeelings about physicians to their product. It’s a predictable one-twopunch that works most every time.\n“Okay Drew, enough examples. What do I do with this info?”\nSimple. Think about which person, persons, and organizations in\nyour industry have a reputation that carries sufficient respect that ifyou got them to endorse your business, product, or service, you couldcapitalize on the transfer of credibility it would create. For specifics abouthow to do this, see Ad Agency Technique #15: The Psychology of So cial\nProof, later in this book.\nAs the transfer technique shows, strategies that appeal to a broad\nrange of the population can be highly successful. Next, let’s explore atechnique of group persuasion .\nPrinciple #4: The Bandwagon Effect—\nGive Them Something to Jump On\nFact:  Humans are social beings with a powerful psychological need\nto belong.\nLong ago, our ancestors understood that, in order to maximize their\nchances for survival, it was in their best interests to form groups of like-minded individuals. So they lived in groups, hunted in groups, pro-tected each other in groups. Everyone had a vital role that contributedto the success of the entire tribe. When the group ate, you ate. When itslept, you slept. When it packed up and moved, you moved. If itdied...well, you get the picture.\nb02 cash ch 2.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 40\nHow to Get Inside Their Heads\n41Although modern societies no longer live this way, membership in—\nand identification with— some group is still critically important for our\nhappiness. We have a need for friends, a romantic relationship, and,ultimately, marriage and children. We join social clubs, fraternities, andsororities; participate in community events; attend religious services;and form business organizations and even street gangs. Heck, we oftenwear shirts and caps proclaiming our associations, which makes us feelaccepted, valuable, and important.\nIn fact, according to psychologist Abraham Maslow’s well-known\nHierarchy of Human Needs pyramid, the need to belong is third onlyto our physiological needs (food, clothing, and shelter) and our safetyneeds (security, stability, and freedom from fear). Once these first twoneeds have been satisfied, belonging or love—which is usually foundwithin families, friendships, membership in associations, and withinour community—becomes a top priority. It’s another LF8 need that’shard-wired in us. And it’s yet another handle the savvy advertiser cangrip in order to persuade.\nThree Types of Groups\nPsychologists tell us there are three primary types of groups, regard-\nless of the group’s purpose:\n1. Aspirational—Groups to which you’d like to belong.\n2. Associative—Groups that share your ideals and values.\n3. Dissociative—Groups to which you do not want to belong.\nBy linking products and services to any of these three reference\ngroups, you can persuade your prospects to make decisions based uponthe group with which they identify, or want to identify.\nThis strategy uses the peripheral —superficial thought—route to per-\nsuasion. (Remember we discussed this earlier?) That’s because theconsumer’s purchase is based primarily on his or her sense of belong-ing, and not entirely on the merits of your product. The need for groupmembership is a strong psychological drive, and in its pursuit, mostconsumers will forego the need for an active, deep analysis of what you’reselling. Aha! We’ve found yet another shortcut to persuasion.\nAnd it’s more than just something that just sounds  good. It’s backed\nby sound research. Stec and Bernstein (1999) support this strategy withtheir Consensus-Implies-Correctness heuristic, which claims that thispsychological concept causes a “bandwagon” effect, which ensures that\nb02 cash ch 2.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 41\nCA$HVERTISING\n42if a large enough group holds a favorable opinion about a product, then\nthat opinion must be correct. We’ll discuss this finding in Principle #17.\nBut to which group do you attempt to link your prospects? Here’s a\nrule of thumb: If seeking aspirational  group influence—people your\nprospects aspire to be similar to—you must make sure your prospectscan easily identify with them.\nFor example: Let’s say you’re selling a new style of bicycle seat for\nracing enthusiasts that feels as though you’re floating on a cushion ofair, rather than sitting on an agonizing platform of blunt, chisel-tippallet nails. Research tells you that the median age of your target mar-ket is 34 years. This immediately tells you that it wouldn’t be wise tofeature a bunch of old men or women in your ad. You also don’t want toshow casual “Everyday Joe” riders on their way to a family picnic lunch.Likewise, your main photo shouldn’t be of an unknown bicycler—evenif he or she is your best customer who happens to spend $1,000 in partsand service every month.\nWhy? Well, remember the group label aspirational ? These simply\naren’t the people your hardcore group aspires  to emulate. Your audience\ndoesn’t want to be the guy or gal next door. They aspire to be similar totour-winning legends Lance Armstrong, Miguel Indurain, or EddyMerckx—three of the best cyclists of all time. Featuring pros such asthese encourages your prospects to believe that, by using your cushy-soft seat, they can be more similar to their two-wheeled heroes.\nSuccessfully gaining associative  group influence is more complex.\nThis strategy requires that you link your product to a certain societalgroup, while often alienating others. This can be done in two ways,either by (1) closely associating your product with the target groupthrough advertising that specifically appeals to the attitudes and valuesof that group, or by (2) disassociating your product from other groupswithin society, in order to make it appear more accepted, or, in the casesof younger audiences, simply more “cool.”\nThe teenage clothing industry successfully uses both methods, with\nsome advertising directly urging kids to belong to the “youth culture,”while other advertising urges them to reject the culture of the “oldies.”\nFor example, in 1969, clothing retailer the Gap flung open its doors\nin San Francisco, and its very name suggested “generation gap,” andthat the items inside are unlike those your parents are wearing. Cur-rently with 3,100 stores—including Banana Republic, Old Navy, and\nb02 cash ch 2.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 42\nHow to Get Inside Their Heads\n43Piperlime—and 2007 revenues of more than $15.8 billion, the associa tive-\ndissociative strategy apparently worked.\nThe bandwagon appeal has worked for scores of companies, including:✸Walgreens: “The pharmacy America trusts.”\n✸Jif Peanut Butter: “Choosy moms choose Jif ” (Don’t you\nwant to be a choosy parent too?)\n✸Eucerin: “The #1 dermatologist-recommended brand\nfor dry skin.”\n✸British Airways: “The world’s favorite airline.”\n✸Glacial Water: “The #1 brand in vended water.”\n✸Mr. Heater: “America’s most popular brand of portable\nheaters.”\n✸Camels: “More doctors smoke Camels than any other\ncigarette.” (Ugh.)\n✸Rinso: “Who else wants a whiter  wash— with no hard\nwork? ”\nYou can successfully appeal to your prospects’ desire to belong in\nseveral categories: age, class, sex, geographic, politics, and education,for example. As supported by Cialdini’s studies of c omparison cues (In-\nfluence: Science and Practice , 1980), by associating your products and\nservices with one or more of these groups, you can successfully per-suade an entire category of the public to immediately identify with theattitudes and values of that group, and compel them to purchase yourproduct as a way of showing the world that they now belong to thatgroup. Fascinating, this “psychology stuff,” isn’t it?\nThink.  Does your product lend itself to using the human need to be-\nlong appeal? If it does, don’t just think about ways to describe its fea-\ntures and benefits. Put at least equal effort into telling your prospectshow buying your product makes  them (aspirational), keeps them (asso-\nciative), or helps them show the world that they’re not a part of a par-\nticular group (dissociative).\nBut before your prospects are willing to buy anything , they must first\nbe motivated enough to do so! The next technique is based upon oneof the classic psychological theories of motivation.\nb02 cash ch 2.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 43\nCA$HVERTISING\n44Principle #5: The Means-End Chain—\nThe Critical Core\n“Don’t buy my product for what it does for you today —buy it for\nwhat it will do for you tomorrow !”\nThat’s what this principle says. And the strategy is based on the\ntheory that many consumer decisions are taken not to satisfy an immedi-\nate need, but for some future  objective. For Joe, your buyer, the prod uct,\nor service he purchased is merely a means to an end.\nLuxury goods and ser vices are often advertised using the Means-End\nChain. The strategy is to persuade your prospects that your pr oduct—\nalthough desirable in its own right—will provide additional secondary\nbenefits to them or their family.\nFor example, buying flowers, chocolates, or sexy undergarments as\na gift for a partner suggests the possibility of enjoying secondary ben-efits, doesn’t it?\nBuying a new car is a wonderful feeling, right? “Forget about that!”\nMr. Lexus Salesman tells you. “Because as a realtor, buying that hot newLexus will make you look more successful to your homebuyers, andthey’ll be far more likely to list their houses with you. They’ll think, ‘Shemust be selling homes...how else could she afford that new Lexus?’”\nAs the advertiser, your goal is obviously to sell your product or ser-\nvice. Using the Means-End Chain, you simply do it by shifting theconsumer’s focus to your product’s ultimate  value or benefit. I call it the\n“benefit of the benefit.”\nTo drive the point home, I ask my CA$HVERTISING seminar au-\ndiences, “Why should I buy a window sign for my new retail business?Tell me the core benefit  of doing so.”  And here’s how the interaction\nusually goes:\nAUDIENCE:AUDIENCE:AUDIENCE:AUDIENCE:AUDIENCE: “The sign tells people who you are.”\nME:ME:ME:ME:ME: “Okay, but what’s the\nbenefit  of telling people who\nI am?”\nAUDIENCE:AUDIENCE:AUDIENCE:AUDIENCE:AUDIENCE: “So they’ll do business with you.”\nME:ME:ME:ME:ME: “True, but what’s the benefit  of people doing busi-\nness with me?”\nAUDIENCE:AUDIENCE:AUDIENCE:AUDIENCE:AUDIENCE: “So you can sell your products, of course!”\nb02 cash ch 2.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 44\nHow to Get Inside Their Heads\n45ME:ME:ME:ME:ME: “Of course. But what’s the benefit  of me selling my\nproducts?”\n(And finally, after pulling a few more teeth, someone fi-\nnally  shouts...)\nAUDIENCE:AUDIENCE:AUDIENCE:AUDIENCE:AUDIENCE: “So you can make money!”\nHallelujah!\nThe formula for activating the Means-End Chain mindset is simple.\nYour copy and images should always represent the positive end results.In this way your prospect is less likely to critically analyze the pros andcons of the actual product, and base their purchase decision on theultimate benefit it will provide them.\nWhat’s the core benefit of your product or service? If you sell shov-\nels, you must understand that people don’t want a long pole with a flat\npiece of attached metal. They do want the holes so they can plant beauti-\nful trees and colorful flowers and make their homes look more attractive!\nIf you sell microwave ovens, people don’t want the big, clunky elec-\ntrical box with all the fancy buttons and the spinning glass plate. Theydo want to be able to cook and eat quickly so they have more time for\nother things.\nCars? The nice paint, smooth-running engine, and supple leather\nsure make them fun to drive, but getting from point A to point B is whypeople really buy them. The ego appeal is icing on the cake.\nJust remember, for  most products, it’s not the product itself that\npeople want, it’s the bottom-line benefit  they’re buying. If people could\nsnap their fingers and magically have a hole appear in the ground, you’dbe out of the shovel business. If they could cook their food in secondsby wiggling their nose, bye-bye Microwave Warehouse. And chances areif you could teleport yourself from point A to point B like Mr. Spock onStar Trek , auto malls and gas stations would be converted into drug\nstores and condos.\nBut no matter what you sell, the major difficulty with persuading\nconsumers is dealing with their varying degrees of product knowledge.The following technique uses these differences to its advantage.\nb02 cash ch 2.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 45\nCA$HVERTISING\n46Principle #6: The Transtheoretical Model —\nPersuasion Step by Step\nIf you don’t know what a hamburger is, I’m going to have a heck of\na time trying to sell you my new “Bloopo Burger,” no matter how freshthe beef, fluffy the bun, and tangy the secret sauce may be.\nThe Transtheoretical Model  (TTM) divides consumer knowledge and\nbehavior into five stages, and it provides the guidelines for persuadingyour prospect so they move from complete ignorance of your product(“What the heck is this?”), to making it a regular purchase or an inte gral\npart of their lifestyles (“Doesn’t everyone buy this?”). When you’re awareof these stages, you’ll better understand how and where to begin yoursales message.\nHere are the stages, in a quick and easy nutshell.\n✸STAGE ONE: Precontemplation —People in this stage are\neither ignorant of your product’s existence—“What theheck is a Bloopo Burger?”—or they’re unaware they need it.\n✸STAGE TWO: Contemplation —Prospects in this stage are\naware of your product and have thought about using it.“Hmmm...I should check out those Bloopo Burgerssomeday.”\n✸STAGE THREE: Preparation —This is the planning\nphase. Your prospect is thinking  about buying from you,\nbut needs more information about your product’sbenefits and advantages. “I’d like to buy a BloopoBurger...it sure looks good, but what the heck is in it? Is ithealthier? Better tasting? What’s it cost?”\n✸STAGE FOUR: Action —Success! Your prospect has\narrived at the coveted action , or purchase phase. “Here’s\nmy credit card, gimme my damned Bloopo!”\n✸STAGE FIVE: Maintenance —A nice place for your\nprospects to be. In this phase, your product has becomepart of their everyday lives. They continue to buy yourBloopos without giving it a second thought. It’s theirburger of choice. Simply put, when they want a burger,they buy a Bloopo.\nAccording to the evidence provided by psychologist James O.\nProchaska (1994), the aim for advertisers who use this technique is to\nb02 cash ch 2.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 46\nHow to Get Inside Their Heads\n47move the consumer through the stages one at a time, until using your\nproduct becomes a habit. The challenge? Dealing successfully with con-sumer groups at different stages of the process. Some of your prospectsare in stage one, while others wouldn’t think of eating any other burger,in stage five. You have two options to tackle this:\n1. Create ads that address all five stages. This lets your\nprospects focus on whatever stage is personally relevantto them. Simply include all the details someone wouldneed to be fully informed about a product they mightknow little, if anything, about.\n2. Create a series of ads that, throughout a period of time,\nprogress from stage one to stage five. Stage one, therefore,introduces your product to the marketplace. Eachsuccessive ad builds upon the last, and can beginhighlighting key features and benefits.\nThe objective of both strategies, of course, is to provide your pros-\npects with enough information and motivation to move them throughthe five stages at their own pace, until they ultimately become regularcustomers.\nNo doubt about it. It’s far easier to reinforce existing consumer atti-\ntudes and behavior than to change those values. The next strategy recog-nizes this fact and uses it to cement your customers’ loyalty.\nPrinciple #7: The Inoculation Theory—\nMake Them Prefer You for Life\nWhen German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche wrote, “What does\nnot kill me makes me stronger,” he could have been talking about thisnext principle of consumer persuasion.\nInoculation Theory  works in much the same way as a vaccination\nyou’d get to prevent the flu. Let me explain. A vaccine consists of avirus that’s weakened using a process called cell culture adaptation . The\nvirus is grown in chicken embryo cells, which changes the genes thattell the virus how to reproduce. This causes the virus to reproduce poorlyin the human body. When injected into your arm, however, your bodyreacts as if the virus was full strength, and quickly attacks and kills it. Indoing so—and this is the important part— your body actually becomes stron-\nger, resistant to that specific virus, for the rest of your life.\nb02 cash ch 2.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 47\nCA$HVERTISING\n48The Inoculation Theory works in a similar way. Developed by social\npsychologist and Y ale professor William J. McGuire, the InoculationTheory is used to reinforce a consumer’s existing attitudes toward aproduct or service by presenting a “weak” argument that tricks the con-sumer into defending his position and therefore strengthening his atti-tude. The three steps are:\n1. Warn of an impending attack.2. Make a weak attack.\n3. Encourage a strong defense.\nFor example, let’s say you and I are pastry chefs, and we work to-\ngether in a bakery turning out the richest, fluffiest, and most amazingchocolate desserts known to man. Your chocolate brand of choice isGuittard, a California-based company whose world-class chocolate isused by many of the most prominent pastry chefs and confectionaryshops in the U.S. and abroad. And let’s say that I just found out thatour boss—Nasty Norman—wants to start using a cheaper (crap) brand.\nSince ol’ Norm loves to fire employees who disagree with him, I\nfigured that I’d get you to fight the chocolate war. Heck, why risk my\njob? The plan: inoculate you. First, according to the strategy, I’d warnyou of an impending attack to ready your defenses and get your mindswirling with possible counterattacks. I might say, “Hey, did you hearthat Nasty Norm is thinking about buying crappy ChocoWax instead ofGuittard to save a few pennies?”\nNext, I’d light a fire under you seat with some weak arguments for\nChocoWax. For example,  “Come to think of it, maybe we could  get away\nwith using ChocoWax by adding a little extra cocoa to our recipes.”And,  “I wonder if people would really taste the difference. After all,\nmost of our competitors use the el crappo chocolate.”  (That will really\nfire you up!)\nAnd finally, I’d encourage you to mount a strong defense by getting\nyou to verbally  express  what you’re thinking, rather than keeping your\nthoughts to yourself. “So...what do you think?” Psychological testingshows that the more actively the recipient defends against the attack,the more vigorously he or she will defend the closely held position.\nBy attacking your ideas and decisions (or brand preferences, as in\nthis example), inoculation encourages you to use critical thought todefend them. Basically, it tricks you into thinking more deeply aboutyour own position, which reinforces your thoughts and feelings. That’s\nb02 cash ch 2.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 48\nHow to Get Inside Their Heads\n49because, in an effort to prepare yourself for the impending attack you\nwere warned about in step one (“Norm’s going to buy ChocoWax!”),you’ve begun to plan your counterattack and sharpen your defenses,so when the real attack (from Norm) comes, you’ll be prepared to tellhim where to put his cheap choc.\nImportant:  Consumer psychologists warn that your attack must be\nweak. Otherwise you risk having the opposite effect and weakening, orchanging your prospects’ attitudes. One way advertisers use inocula-tion is by publicizing their competitors’ criticisms of their company,and turning them to their advantage in the form of weak attacks that—thanks to the Inoculation Theory—serve to reinforce and ensure theirconsumers’ loyalty.\nInoculation is a favorite among politicians. Their stock line goes\nthis way: “My opponent will tell you  there’s no way to bring down skyrock-\neting oil prices... he’ll tell you  that the only way to balance the national\nbudget is to raise your taxes... he’ll tell you  that it’s good enough to pro-\nvide health insurance for most citizens, not all of them. But I tell youthis is definitely not the case, and here is why....”\nDo you see what’s happening? This candidate is inoculating his\naudience by (1) warning them of an impending attack, (2) presentingthe weak arguments his opponent will say during the campaign, and(3) encouraging a strong defense by giving them a little ammunition tohelp prepare for battle.\nAn auto body shop might take aim at the competition by adopting a\nconsumer-advocate-type position by telling prospects to be wary whengetting quotes from competitors: “Our competitors will tell you  that the\nlittle dent in your fender costs over $1,000 to fix. They’ll quote you  $800\nto replace your windshield because of that tiny chip in the glass. Whatthey won’t tell you is there are many ‘insider’ secrets in our business forgetting these jobs done for a fraction of the cost. For example....”\nSo how can you quash your competitors’ sales arguments by launch-\ning a preemptive strike using the Inoculation Theory? The key is toprep them in such a way so that your prospects process your competi-tors’ claims though your filters! Like the auto body shop owner in the\nlast example, tell them what to look out for; what’s good; what’s bad;what’s suspect. Doing so implies that you’re so confident in what you\nsell that you’re inviting closer inspection. You want them to compare!\nAnd I don’t use the term consumer advocate  lightly. The fact is, if\nyou’re providing legitimate information—and I trust you are—then your\nb02 cash ch 2.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 49\nCA$HVERTISING\n50advertising becomes more than just another business shouting “Me!\nMe! Me! Buy from ME!” You’re actually providing a helpful servicethat—assuming your product or service is truly better—will translateinto additional business and tremendous public goodwill.\nAre you a pizza shop? “Our competitors tell you  they use fresh mozza-\nrella, but they don’t tell you  they buy it pre-shredded in big plastic bags. At\nPauley’s Pizza, we hand-shred our mozzarella every morning. Our com-petitors offer you a choice of thin and crispy or deep dish Sicilian, but\nthey don’t tell you  that they buy their dough in hard frozen balls and thaw\nit out the night before. At Pauley’s Pizza, we make our dough freshevery single day. Our competitors tell you  how convenient their home de-\nlivery service is, b ut they don’t tell you  that their average delivery time is\nover an hour. Pauley’s Pizza delivers in 28 minutes or your pizza is free.”\nAds similar to these create more critical consumers that are predis-\nposed to your products. This “Ralph Nadar approach” builds greattrust and credibility. Take a real hard look at what you’re selling. Whatdo you do better, faster, easier? Inoculate your prospects by bringingthese advantages to light and watch how you’ll win them over.\nPrinciple #8: Belief Re-ranking—\nChange Their Reality\nLet’s face it: Most people don’t like change. As impervious as bull-\nfrogs are to water, human beings are to doing things differently. It’stough enough to get people to change small physical things about them-selves: the way they dress, their hairstyle, the way they work, the waythey speak. Trying to get them to change their beliefs about life? Ugh!You see, psychologists know that even if our beliefs are inaccurate orinconsistent—even if we ourselves  know they are—we’ll still defend them\nas if their existence is somehow linked to our very survival! Link any-thing to survival—and that’s exactly what the ego does, by the way—and you’re up against a brutally tough opponent.\nFortunately, there are ways to change people’s beliefs about your\nproduct, the primary belief being that they don’t want or need it ! One of\nthe most effective of these methods works by switching the focus awayfrom the attitudes themselves and onto the underlying beliefs.\nb02 cash ch 2.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 50\nHow to Get Inside Their Heads\n51Change the Focus of the Beliefs\nIn order to influence beliefs, advertisers use images and statistics\nthat appeal either to emotions, such as fear, humor, or guilt (affectingthe right-hemisphere, creative brain), or to the consumer’s intellect,through factual evidence and examples (affecting the left-hemisphere,logical brain). When you do this, you present your audience with analternative view of reality—one that’s not supported by their currentlyheld beliefs. In other words, you might feel a certain way about a prod-uct, but your beliefs can be changed if you’re given new ways to thinkabout it.\nThe Baking Soda Blues\nFor example, let’s say you love baking soda toothpaste because you\nread somewhere that it’s the easiest—and least expensive—way to whitenyour teeth at home. In fact, you’ve told all your friends and family thatthey too should be using baking soda toothpaste if they want super-white choppers. “Baking soda, baking soda, baking soda.” You won’tshut the heck up about the damned baking soda. You’ve been using thetoothpaste for more than a decade. And you’ve recommended it so much\nthat your friends and family are afraid to smile in front of you for fear ofbeing chastised should their teeth not meet your annoying new dental-whiteness standards.\nOne day, however, you see a disturbing article in the newspaper. Oh\nno! A quote about baking soda by Ken Burrell, D.D.S., senior director ofthe American Dental Association Council on Scientific Affairs, sendsyou reeling: “We think the public believes there is some benefit, but infact, there is no evidence to show any therapeutic value.”\nHorrors! “How can this possibly be?!” you shout. Mental storm clouds\nroll in, lightning strikes, and the first chink in your enamel-white armorappears.\nBut it doesn’t stop there. Shortly thereafter you read this quote from\nanother  respected dentist, “Baking soda has a taste sensation that makes\nteeth feel good, but there is no proven therapeutic value.”\nGulp. Before you know it, you’re standing in front of the mirror\nexamining the whiteness of your teeth, wondering if all that white sparklewas simply a pigment of your imagination. Your own dentist confirmsthe horrible truth, and your baking soda sandcastle comes crumblingdown. Your feelings were attacked by reason, and eventually, criticalthinking—via central route processing—emerged the victor.\nb02 cash ch 2.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 51\nCA$HVERTISING\n52The Kung Fu Concession\nLet’s say you really dislike any form of violence, but you’re not com-\nfortable walking the streets anymore because of the recent surge in vio-lent crimes in your area.

Well, one day a friend hands you abrochure from her Wing Chun school. It’s filled with gruesome statsabout local-area crime rates. And it contains testimonials from currentstudents who describe how they successfully defended themselvesagainst attackers. They talk about how safe the training is, how easy itwas to learn, how patient and caring the instructors are.

And suddenly all you’re doing is thinking about those crimestats, that Kung Fu brochure with the success stories you keep reading,and how your friends and their children successfully used what they’velearned. And before you know it, you’re watching your friend in class,and you’re now one step closer to becoming the school’s newest member.\nOf course, your prospects may remain suspicious of the ideas you\npresent, and many will reject the ad—just as they can with any other ad.(A 100-percent response rate is still the stuff of advertisers’ dreams.)But many others will amend their beliefs in order to harmoniously existwith their new perceptions. Not to do so causes cognitive dissonance , an\nuncomfortable feeling that happens when you simultaneously hold con-flicting thoughts or beliefs—something the human mind dislikes intensely.\nChange the Importance of the Beliefs\nAnother approach is to change the importance  of beliefs, rather than\nthe beliefs themselves. That’s because it’s easier to strengthen or weakenan existing belief than it is to change it.\nThe most successful method is to strengthen your prospects’ cur-\nrent beliefs either by supporting them with factual evidence (pouringon the stats, reports, studies, testimonials), or by using everyday ex-amples (success stories from other users, for example) with which yourprospects can identify. Many advertisers take this technique one step\nb02 cash ch 2.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 52\nHow to Get Inside Their Heads\n53further and reinforce additional  beliefs, which are unlikely to meet with\nresistance because they don’t conflict with existing beliefs.\nThe strategy of manipulating current beliefs, either through rein-\nforcement  or undermining , is far easier and more likely to succeed than\nattempting a wholesale change of basic beliefs. That’s why it’s the morepopular persuasion strategy.\nFor example, nowadays everyone knows that smoking and excessive\ndrinking are not good for your health. But no matter how often or howforcefully you stress these points, consumers’ defensive tachometersredline instantly if they sense that they’re being criticized or attacked.“You talkin’ to me? You talkin’ to me?”\nHow do you avoid this? By either (1) reinforcing the beliefs of those\nprospects who already hold a positive view about your product, or (2) bysubtly offering an alternative set of beliefs to those you wish to convert.\nFor example, advertisers of food and drink know that most con-\nsumers today believe in the importance of a healthy, balanced diet. Theycan reinforce this belief—and gain an advantage over their rivals—byemphasizing that their brand contains vitamin x, y, or z, or is sugar free,\nor any other health-related benefit that will build upon the audience’scurrently held beliefs. (Simply put, we’re adding on to what we knowthey already believe. We’re giving them more of what we know they wantto hear: how healthy our product is for them.)\nRemember: we don’t want to cause any negative reactions. Our goal\nis not to fight with our prospects. We don’t want to tell them they’rewrong. We want to change their beliefs without causing a negative, de-fensive reaction.\nFor instance, rather than blatantly stating “Milk is healthier than\nsoda,” you should present images and factual examples of the potentialhealth risks posed by soda, and compare that with equally graphic andpersuasive evidence for the health benefits of milk. See the difference?This way, you avoid a head-on collision with your prospects’ existingbeliefs. You weasel your way in, so to speak.\nNow listen carefully. Regardless of what technique you use, your\nprospects must remain unaware that you’re attempting to influencethem. You want them to think they’ve made their own decision. Thisway there are no bruised egos; they claim the decision as their own, andit’s far more likely to become cemented in future new behavior.\n“Gotcha, Drew...but how do I do this?”\nb02 cash ch 2.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 53\nCA$HVERTISING\n54You do it by removing your prospects’ need for cognitive (critical)\nthinking. The following technique makes it easier for you by dividingproducts into those that require a lot of cognitive thought, and thosethat require little.\nPrinciple #9: The Elaboration Likelihood\nModel— Adjust Their Attitude\nIt’s quite a mouthful, isn’t it? Don’t fret. We touched on this earlier,\nso now let’s dig in! The Elaboration Likelihood Model, or ELM, sug-gests there are two routes to attitude change: the central  route and the\nperipheral  route. Here’s the difference:\n✸The central route: Persuading using logic, reasoning, and\ndeep thinking.\n✸The peripheral route: Persuading using the association of\npleasant thoughts and positive images, or “cues.”\nWhich method should you use? That depends on your product.\nThe peripheral  route encourages consumers to consciously—or often\nunconsciously—focus on superficial images and “cues” in order to in-fluence attitudes and decisions, without any serious consideration ofthe ad’s content.\nBy contrast, the central route  encourages your audience to really think\nabout it...to consider the ad’s issues and arguments before reaching anydecision, especially making a purchase.\nThe ELM Rule of Thumb\nYou think harder, longer, and deeper about important purchases\nthan you do for unimportant ones, right? Of course. Psychologists saythat consumers’ motivation tends to be higher when they’re consider-ing products with “high personal relevance.” That’s fancy talk for some-thing that either costs big bucks, or is important (to the buyer) in someway—such as earthquake insurance for someone whose house teetersprecipitously on the San Andreas fault (for example, uh, like mine).\nYou’re not going to purchase a $928,000 house using the same\nthought process that you’d use to buy a can of pork and beans, right?Of course not. The two buying decisions require different levels, quali-ties, and depths of thought. When thinking about buying the house,your brain switches to central route processing. Meaning that you’llcarefully consider all the arguments and analyze all available facts. “Let’s\nb02 cash ch 2.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 54\nHow to Get Inside Their Heads\n55see...interest rates on the 5-year adjustable rate mortgage compare favor-\nably to 30- year fixed...our current debt-to-income ratio is 18 per cent...and\nif we put down at least 20 percent we won’t need to pay for private mort-gage insurance, thereby lowering our monthly payments.”\nThat’s an example of left-brain thinking, referring to the side of\nyour brain that controls logical thought and reasoning; crunching num-bers and weighing options. And it’s the kind of thinking you ought  to\ndo before making such a purchase. Buy the wrong house and—afteruprooting your family, moving across the country away from family andfriends, and starting a new job—you could easily wind up shackled in aself-created financial and emotional torture chamber.\nBy contrast, when you’re holding two cans of baked beans, your\nbrain presses the big peripheral route button, and the result is simply,“Yum. Beans!” No big decision here. And not much brain power isneeded. After all, if you buy the wrong beans, you simply say,“Blorf...lousy beans!” and dump them down the drain.\nSo what kind of thought process does purchasing your product\nrequire?\nWhen advertising your peripheral route product, don’t neglect in-\ncluding the features and benefits, of course. Just realize that most con-sumers won’t rack their brains over which brand of sugar, paperclips, orthimbles to buy. These things—and many others—are simply not “deepthought” purchases and therefore don’t require deep-thought ad content.\nDon’t get me wrong. I didn’t say you don’t need to do anything but\nshow some smiling faces and a photo of my cute flat-coated retrieverJoey to rake in sales. You should still give basic data to satisfy theirIf Your P roduct R equir es: Then Do This:\nCentral Route\nProcessingPour on the facts, stats, evidence,\ntestimonials, studies, reports, and casehistories. Weave them into your mostpersuasive sales argument.\nPeripheral Route\nProcessingLoad your ads full of colorful, pleas-\nant images, humorous or popularsubject matter, or the sponsorship ofcelebrities.\nb02 cash ch 2.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 55\nCA$HVERTISING\n56fundamental data needs. If you sell ink-jet paper, for example, you still\nwant to state its size, color, weight, sheet quantity, and even the TAPPIBrightness Standard rating. If you have competitors—and most of usdo—and your product is better than theirs in some way, for heaven’ssake, say it!\nCues Feel Good, But Central Route\nProcessing Makes Them Prefer You\nY esterday they couldn’t get enough of your product. Today they\ncan’t even remember its name. Why? The Elaboration Likelihood Modelprovides an explanation for why some attitudes persist throughout aconsumer’s lifetime, whereas others are less stable and more prone to\nchange. Research has found that attitudes based on central routeprocessing are more resistant to counter- persuasion, and show greater\nattitude-behavior consistency than attitudes formed by peripheral routethinking.\nIt makes perfect sense. Because when you use central route process-\ning, you support your decisions with well-considered mental argumentsthat you’re constantly seeking to reinforce and strengthen. “After all,”you say, “I gave it a lot of thought...I know it was the right decision.”(Notice how attitudes formed by central route processing become soclosely aligned with the ego that they become inseparable. Anyone whochallenges something you carefully thought about—put a lot of “thinktime” into—seems to be challenging your very intelligence!)\nWant examples? Look around you!  Talk to people about any topic in\nwhich they spent a ridiculous amount of time in mental exploration,\nreinforcement, and justification: religion, politics, abortion, child-rear ing,\nand education, for examples. Their positions on topics such as theseare stubbornly persistent and tenaciously resistant to change.\nNow ask these same people, “What kind of soap do you use? What\nbrands of cereal do you eat?”  For products such as these, and others,\nthey may have preferences, but their attitudes about them can typicallybe easily changed.\nOne last thing you should know about the ELM. Attitudes devel-\noped using central route processing will last longer than those formedby the peripheral route. Simply put, logic and reason burn themselvesinto the brain far more deeply than good feelings created by visual cuesor other emotion-stimulating catalysts.\nb02 cash ch 2.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 56\nHow to Get Inside Their Heads\n57Remember: When you get someone to think deeply about some-\nthing, and you persuade them to arrive at a conclusion, they will adopttheir decision as a result of their own thinking, protect it, and defend itagainst (competitors’) attacks as if it were their “baby”—their “brain child.”\nBy using the peripheral route to persuasion, advertisers are relying\non the effectiveness of what social psychologists call cues, as we dis-\ncussed earlier. These cues are mental shortcuts that, if utilized correctly,can convey an ad’s message without the need to engage the consumerin any form of deep thought. The following technique is based uponthe influence that can be exerted by using the right cue for the rightoccasion.\nPrinciple #10: The 6 Weapons of\nInfluence —Shortcuts to Persuasion\nSocial psychologist Robert Cialdini is a clever guy. In preparing his\nbook Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion (1998),  he took three years\nand went undercover performing a variety of jobs to watch influence inaction. Posing as everything from a used car salesman to a telemarketer,he studied the words and behaviors that move people to comply...andbuy. From this, he developed his Cues of Life model that describes how\npeople are persuaded using six general “Cues of Influence.”\nThese cues are mental shortcuts, and are effective in many different\nsituations—especially when your prospect isn’t using careful, “consid-ered” thought. Use these cues when you’re writing an ad using theperipheral route to persuasion, but fuhgeddaboutit if buying your prod-\nuct requires lots of thought, reasoning, and maybe even a little justifica-tion, such as a luxury item or a high-cost anything  at all.\nKnown by the mnemonic CLARCCS, Cialdini’s six cues are:\n1. Comparison: The power of your peers.\n2. Liking: The Balance Theory. “I like you... take my money !”\n3. Authority: Cracking the code of credibility.\n4. Reciprocation: What goes around comes\naround... profitably !\n5. Commitment/consistency: The “Four Walls” technique.6. Scarcity: Get ’em while they last!\nb02 cash ch 2.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 57\nCA$HVERTISING\n58Cue #1: Comparison\nLet’s first look at comparison, which is similar to group persua sion—\nor the bandwagon effect—and is an extremely potent weapon in youradvertising armory. The question, “Everybody else is doing it, why aren’tyou?” exerts a powerful effect on consumers. Human psychology teachesus that no one likes to be left out, and that we’re all driven by a need tobelong (See Principle #4: The Bandwagon Effect). Therefore, if some-one sees his or her friends, family, or peers wearing a certain fashion(low-cut sneaker socks, for example, putting a certain bumper stickeron their car (“Support Our Troops!”), or drinking a specific brand ofbeer (Corona with a juicy lime wedge), there’s enormous pressure toconform, both internal (“Gee...everyone’s wearing really short sneaker\nsocks...mine are really high; I wonder if I look like a dork.”) and exter-nal (“Hey Drew, what’s with the dorky high white socks? You look likethat geek from our 1977 gym class!”).\nAs an advertiser, this is a godsend. Because if I can successfully\nconvey the message that my product is the one that a certain groupshould choose, then my sales could snowball simply from creating thismindset.\nCue #2: Liking\nLiking  says, in effect, “Because you like me, you should do as I say: BUY!”\nThis potent cue applies whenever a consumer feels a connection with arepresentative of a company, the characters or personalities in an ad, oranother user of the product.\nFor example, I used to work with a woman named Dianne. She used\nto sell everything from candles to baskets. And she’d always pass aroundher catalogs to other employees and ask for orders. I watched manysuccumb to the pressure of the liking  cue. She had the kind of person-\nality that made you instantly like her. But what about the quality of thecandles and baskets she sold? Oh, that didn’t matter one bit. Because itwas the internal pressure to accommodate or please Dianne—driven bythe liking  cue—that caused so many people to buy from her.\nSimilarly, when a coworker you like storms into your office and says,\n“Hey...my daughter Ariel is doing a fund raiser for cancer r esearch...would\nyou please sponsor her in his race?” Wow...talk about a triple whammy!(1) Daughter, (2) cancer, and (3) the person asking. You’re screwed. Justsign the form and fork over the cash.\nb02 cash ch 2.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 58\nHow to Get Inside Their Heads\n59Remember:  The lynchpin of the sale is liking— you must like the\nperson for it to work . And this liking could be focused on anyone in-\nvolved in the transaction, whether it’s the person handing out flyers onthe street corner, the celebrity whose face adorns an ad, or the friendwho purchased the same brand last week and is now urging you to dolikewise.\nThe Better They Look, the More Others Like\n“Don’t judge a book by its cover” is a great expression, but that’s\nexactly  what people do when they look into the eyes of a person they\nconsider attractive. Many psychological and sociological experimentshave concluded that attractive people exert a greater influence on oth-ers, and are considered to be more trustworthy and likable (Down &Lyons, Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin , 1991). No wonder most\nads feature happy, attractive faces smiling out at the consumer from thepages of magazines, newspapers, and direct mail catalogs.\nAnd here’s another interesting fact: Contrary to popular belief, men\nare most attracted to pictures of other men, and women to pictures ofother women. Why? P sychologists say: Identification . All of us are in-\nterested primarily in ourselves; no one is more important to you thanyou. When an ad shows a picture of a handsome, important-looking\nman, for example, other men will identify with that person, step intohis shoes, and briefly become handsome and important-lookingthemselves. This same principle applies to women.\nCue #3: Authority\nThe third cue is authority, and it’s a mental shortcut used since the\nbeginning of time. Many healthcare products have long relied on theendorsement of the “man in the white coat” for authority. Just as peopletrust the word of their doctor, dentist, or optician, they’ll generally ac-cept the authority of any official-looking person who endorses an ad-vertised product.\nThis is a prime example of the peripheral route to persuasion in\naction. Using an official, intelligent, or authoritative figure to promotea product saves consumers the trouble of researching or examining theissues, and they simply accept the facts and claims as being true. Infact, before the FCC cracked down on it, many advertisers hired actors\nwho played doctors in popular TV shows to endorse their aspirin, coldremedies and other medical-related products, fully outfitted in the doctor\nb02 cash ch 2.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 59\nCA$HVERTISING\n60costumes they wore in the shows. Funny, isn’t it? The viewers knew these\npeople were just actors, yet they were still persuaded by the powerfulauthority cue built by their characters. The cue is so powerful that itdidn’t even matter when the FCC forced these actors to say “I’m notreally a doctor, but I play one on TV ....”  They still bought!\nThink! What authority in your industry does your target market re-\nspect? Do whatever you can to get a testimonial or full-blown endorse-ment. Then get permission to use this person’s image in your marketing.Pay the authority to do a short video you can use on your Website or ona DVD. Then add a list of persuasive facts, figures, and scientific-lookinggraphs, and the authority cue can help you make a lot of money.\nCue #4: Reciprocation\nDuring a CA$HVERTISING workshop, I asked someone in my\naudience, “Eileen, are you well-mannered?” She quickly shot back, “Ofcourse I am!” I continued, “Okay, then what do you do when someonegives you something?”  She says, “I say ‘thank you.’” I continue,\n“Y es...and then what do you feel compelled to do?” She thinks a mo-ment and blurts out, “Uh...give them something in return?” Exactly!\nThis is the basis of the mental cue known as  reciprocation, and it’s a\nfavorite of catalog companies, subscription magazines, and any busi-ness engaged in sampling. Did you ever wonder how these companiescould afford to give away freebies with every first order? The reason isreciprocation . They give you something, and you’re compelled to pur-\nchase something from them in return. The influence is so strong, infact, that the free gift may be nothing more than a scratchy 2-cent penfilled with only a week’s worth of ink.\nWhy does it work? Because the company has given you something,\nand you accepted it! Social convention now decrees that you’re obli-gated to give something back. It’s why survey companies often sendyou a one-dollar bill to thank you for completing the survey. The four-page survey may contain 100 tedious questions, but the dollar makesyou feel that you should  do it. It’s fascinating.\nHere’s another familiar example. Walk through many major U.S.\nairports and you might be handed a rose by a member of the HareKrishna religious group. Upon accepting this free gift, you’re then askedto make a donation. Because you already accepted the gift, you’recompelled to comply. You’d feel badly if you didn’t. Ahhh...there’s\nb02 cash ch 2.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 60\nHow to Get Inside Their Heads\n61that child hood training again, and it’s now a programmed response. At\nleast now you’re aware of it, and now you can use it to your advantage.\nJay Siff, a wonderful client of many years, uses the reciprocation\nprinciple to the hilt. His company, Moving Targets of Perkasie, Pennsyl-vania (MovingTargets.com), sends gift certificates to people who justmoved into the neighborhood on behalf of his primarily restaurant andauto-shop clients. Free pizza, free entrée, free oil change. Not only doesthe service introduce new movers to the retailers’ businesses, but it alsosets the reciprocation ball in motion. When they’re done chomping onthat pizza, or driving away with a fresh oil fill—assuming they were bothtreated right and satisfied—not only do they have good feelings aboutthe business, but they’re also far more likely to return and spend money,often becoming loyal long-term customers. Moving Target’s use of thereciprocation principle is so refined and effective—and has been formore than 16 years—that many companies use it as their primary mar-keting strategy.\nWhat can you give away to start the reciprocation ball rolling? I’m\nnot talking about some junky little trinket, like a cheap key ring featur-ing your logo and phone number. You want to give something of value.Something that makes your recipient think, “Hey, wow, wasn’t thatthoughtful?” Can you give a free sample? A gift certificate? If you’re aconsultant, how about giving 30 minutes of your time with no obliga-tion? Many attorneys offer free first consultations, but that’s not whatI’m talking about here. The reciprocation mindset is initiated when yougive something to someone as a gift. It’s not something they shouldhave to request  from you. (If I have to request it, it’s a favor .) And it’s not\nsomething you give me in return for something I’ve done. (That’s athank you .)\nHere are some examples of what I’m talking about.\n✸Are you a dog groomer? Give a free flea and tick collar.\n✸Are you a bakery? Give a free rye bread or a box of\nchocolate chip cookies.\n✸Are you a bike shop? Give a free water bottle.\n✸Are you an old-fashioned shoe repair shop? Give a free\nshine.\n✸Are you a karate school? Give a month of free lessons.\n✸Are you a printer? Give 50 free photocopies.\n✸Are you a florist? Give a free bunch of flowers.\nb02 cash ch 2.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 61\nCA$HVERTISING\n62✸Are you a cigar shop? Give a free lighter.\n✸Are you a pizzeria? Give a free slice.\nWhoever  you are, give away something ...and let the magic of reciproca-\ntion turn mere prospects into profitable, perhaps long-term customers.\nCue #5:  Commitment/Consistency\nIn Disney’s popular Haunted Mansion , an eerie voice threatens, “Look\naround you. Your logic cannot deny that this chamber has no windowsand no doors. Which offers a rather logical challenge...to find...away...out.” (Cue demonic laughter.)\nThat’s the object of the  commitment/consistency cue, also known\nas the  “Four Walls” technique—not to scare buyers away, but to box\nthem in, cause them to take a stand, and make a request that woulddemonstrate their commitment to their stand. You create an ad thatposes four questions to your prospect, with each answer leading logi-cally to the next, until, at the end of your ad, your prospect is all butcommitted to making the purchase (Cialdini, 1980).\nThe commitment/consistency cue says that if you take a stand on\nan issue, you  must remain consistent with your beliefs . This is a powerful\npsychological tactic, and one that’s more effective when used in per-son, because the cue relies on social pressure as its engine. For example,someone knocks on your door and says, “Hi! Would you please sign mypetition to help reduce neighborhood crime and make our streets safer?”No-brainer, right? So you sign away. Now that you’ve committed to thatvery reasonable stance, society expects you to remain consistent with it.And so you will.  That’s why when the petitioner next says, “Great! Thank\nyou. And now would you please make a small tax-deductible $3 dona-tion because we need to buy two-way radios for the neighborhoodwatch?”  Yikes. You’ve been boxed in, my friend. And now you can do\nlittle else but gulp, reach into your pocket, and hand over the cash. Youwere a lab rat in an experiment, and you behaved exactly as anticipated.To not donate the $3 is infinitely more difficult than if (1) you didn’t\nsupport the cause (you’d have no reason to donate), or (2) you weren’tfirst asked to sign the petition. Because you did, however, the petitioner\nhad already pre-closed you, and the natural next step was to simplyextract your moolah. The closing question—whatever it is—says, in ef-fect, “Okay, you’ve declared your stance. Let’s see if you’re now goingto support your own declared position.”  To not do so is the ultimate in\nhypocrisy.\nb02 cash ch 2.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 62\nHow to Get Inside Their Heads\n63Although not as effective in print as in person, here’s how the prin-\nciple looks on paper. You’d start by ask questions that stimulate theresponse you’re seeking:\nAre you afraid to walk the streets alone? Don’t you wish\nthere was an easy way to protect yourself against mug-gers and other low-life scum who prey on innocentpeople? You know the ones I mean: The dirt bags whostep right into your face and ask—threateningly—“yougot some spare change?” Wouldn’t it be great if therewas a safe, effective, and easy way to stop thugs cold atthe push of a button? A way that gives you instant andtotal control over even the most savage 350-pound, drug-blitzed maniac who has the gall to try to intimidate—andpossibly terribly injure—you and your family? Introduc-ing\nThe Tesla Sizzler ...the world’s first personal anti-mug ging\nmicrowave force field....\nThe idea is to elicit a string of “yes” responses from your prospect,\neach successive answer adding momentum, creating a snowball of in-terest and desire, and presenting your product as the path to fulfill-ment. Because there’s no human interaction, there’s also no socialpressure for you to be consistent with your answers, meaning to buy.Just because you’re interested in preventing getting mugged and youfind the whole idea of cooking local muggers with personal microwaveguns fascinating, there’s no one interacting with you to escort you tothe next step in the sales process. Without this social pressure, the adrelies on a multitude of copy and design techniques to encourage youto read the whole sales pitch and then pick up the phone and placeyour order. Effectively written long-copy direct-response ads do exactlythis.\nCue #6:  Scarcity\nThe last of Cialdini’s cues is scarcity. If, in addition to telling you all\nthe benefits of attending, I say, “My CA$HVERTISING workshop hasvery limited seating and is very difficult to buy tickets for,” then it be-comes more desirable. Why? Simply, we want what we cannot have.\nTake the Cabbage Patch Kids craze of 1983. People went bonkers\ntrying to buy these u gly vinyl-faced dolls. They knocked over display\ntables, screamed, cursed, and fought like rabid cats in departmentstores. One particularly unruly crowd of 1,000 would-be Cabbage Patch\nb02 cash ch 2.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 63\nCA$HVERTISING\n64“parents” turned violent after waiting eight hours and stormed a Zayre\nstore in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. Wielding a baseball bat, the man-ager kept the frenzied buyers at bay. The fact is, the success of thesedolls caught the Coleco company off guard: they couldn’t produceenough to satisfy demand. In fact, the consumer affairs department ofNew York’s Nassau County filed a lawsuit accusing Coleco of “harass-ing” children by advertising dolls that weren’t available, forcing the com-pany to suspend advertising. Too funny. And too late. The scarcity effecthad already thrust its hooks into the American doll-buying conscious-ness, and that, in turn, fueled even greater  demand.\nIf you can’t have it, you suddenly want it. It’s like the armrest you\nweren’t using in the movie theater or airplane. As soon as someone sitsbeside you and starts using it, you suddenly have a strong desire tosomehow “get it back.” You feel as if they took “your” armrest. And itmight continue to annoy you the entire length of the movie or untilyour flight lands. Hmmm...when you had it, you didn’t want it. When\nsomeone took it from you, there was nothing you wanted more. Inter-esting how we humans are wired.\nThe most common manifestation of the scarcity principle is the use\nof lines such as one-day sale , limited offer , only while supplies last , or first\ncome, first served , all which make the product appear in short supply,\nand therefore increases consumer interest. The success of this tech-nique is apparent—every business uses it! Using the scarcity cue is likeusing a deadline, except scarcity also suggests exclusivity, not simplylimited supply. Ahhh...now that’s a powerful one-two punch if I eversaw one.\nIn a twist of the scarcity cue, I’ve seen several business consultants\nannounce, “Steve is finally available to accept three more clients. Buthurry! Because once his roster is full, his services won’t be available foranother two years.”  In this example, consultant Steve is emphasizing\nscarcity by telling you he’s now available...with an added zinger thatwarns you that you better act fast.\nPrinciple #11: Message Organization—\nAttaining Critical Clarity\nUnderstand if you saying don’t what I’m, persuade I can’t you. Huh?\nThe point is clear. “If you don’t understand what I’m saying, I can’tpersuade you.” Even if you have the greatest product in the world, theslickest-looking sales materials, and scores of hot testimonials from\nb02 cash ch 2.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 64\nHow to Get Inside Their Heads\n65customers who light candles for you every night, if your ads are disor-\nganized or poorly structured, your cash register ain’t gonna ring! Evenworse, you could actually harm  your business with ads that leave your\nprospects with an inaccurate or totally incorrect interpretation of yourintended message—something that could negatively affect you for along time.\nThat’s why ad agencies and the psychologists they employ are care-\nful to ensure that, whatever the strength of the message, it must alwaysbe well organized and easily and accurately understood. Simple is bet-ter, but simple isn’t necessarily easy. Communicating clearly and plainly\ntakes practice. But fret not. I devote an entire technique to this topic inthe next chapter, in “Ad Agency Secret #1: The Psychology of Simplicity.”After reading it, you’ll know exactly what to do and how to do it.\nPrinciple #12: Examples vs. Statistics —\nAnd the Winner Is...\nWhich is more persuasive: examples or statistics?

No wonder most ads and TV commercials use testi-monials and endorsements rather than long lists of facts and figures.They’re simply more dramatic and engaging.\n“But Drew! Some people do want to know facts and figures!” Of\ncourse they do. And depending upon what kind of product you’re sell-ing, you should  include them. But not to the exclusion of strong, emo-\ntionally provoking examples. And a good case can be made for includingboth examples and statistics in your ads. The proportion of each should\nbe carefully considered so you don’t alienate either group. “But how doI know that?” Simple: Your product will tell you.\nb02 cash ch 2.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 66\nHow to Get Inside Their Heads\n67✸Do you sell beer?

Well, the same is true in\nadvertising. You can present just your side of the story...or you can\npresent your side and your competitor’s side in a head-to-head prod-\nuct comparison.\nAlthough one-sided messages are simpler (because you’re discuss-\ning only your product), studies show that two-sided messages are morepersuasive, but only if they stick to the format of defending their ownposition while also attacking the competition (Allen, 1991).\nThe key is to present both sides and still advocate only one— your\nown. How? By making your two-sided message appear  to the reader as\nfair-minded and balanced. For example:\nb02 cash ch 2.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 67\nCA$HVERTISING\n68Acme makes an excellent fly swatter, and they’ve been\ndoing so for years. Heck, in the 1940s and ’50s they werethe most popular way to kill the pesky critters. And theydid a darn good job back then. However, now it’s the 21stcentury. And it’s time to step up to full-scale fly-swattingautomation, with our new\nRoboSwat Laser-Powered Anti-\nFly Gun Turret . So easy and effective, it makes old-fash ioned\n(and messy) swatters obsolete!\nUsing the peripheral route to persuasion (superficial thinking, re-\nmember?), your audience is likely to think that your two-sided messageis more thoughtful and credible than your competition’s one-sided adsthat talk only about themselves. Complimenting the other company onits fine products instantly makes your prospect think, “Hmmm...they’rebeing fair to the other firm, not bashing them, actually saying nice things,but simply pointing out that theirs is better.” If your prospect decidesto use central processing (deep thinking and reasoning) and considersthe message carefully, the combination of defense and attack makesthem think even more systematically about the issue, and start ques-tioning the validity of the other side. So not only does it help persuadeprospects to favor your product, but it also helps turn them againstthose of your rivals.\nComparison ads don’t have to be about bashing the other guy into\nsubmission. You can calmly point out the advantages your product pro-vides. What benefits do you offer that they don’t? Is yours faster? Easier?Cleaner? Healthier? More fun? Less expensive? More effective? Com-parison charts that point out your product’s advantages at a glance areextremely effective. Consumers interpret such charts as, “Ahhh...all theresearch has been done for me. All I need to do now is buy.” This isperipheral processing at its best. That’s because a central-route thinkerwould say, “Hmm...sounds good, but how do I know these facts areright? I’m going to check what the other company is saying. After all,these people are trying to persuade me to buy!” The fact is, however,most people are lazy peripheral-route thinkers, and the comparison chartis all they need to make their buying decision. So be a good sport. Tellboth sides. Compliment what’s good about your competition. It mighteven make you feel good. Then say why you’re  even better. The persuasive\nimpact resulting in additional sales will definitely make you feel great!\nYou can even play both sides yourself. You’ll recall back in the Preface\nI said if you’re afraid of the words persuasion  and influence you should\nb02 cash ch 2.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 68\nHow to Get Inside Their Heads\n69“stop reading” because “this book is not for you.” I was playing take-\naway, telling you that you couldn’t have something in an effort to makeyou want it even more. Don’t ever be afraid to tell people why theyshouldn’t  buy what you’re selling. Not only does it boost your credibility,\nbut if they’re true prospects, it’ll also add fire to their desire.\nPrinciple #14: Repetition and\nRedundancy —The Familiarity Factor\n“People don’t start seeing your ad until you run it seven times.”\nDid you ever hear that one? It’s likely based on a similar expression\nused in personal selling: “It takes an average of seven sales calls to closea deal.”  Whatever the actual number is, repetition is an important fac-\ntor in getting your point across in advertising. Repeating your messagenot only helps break down walls of disinterest, but with each repetitionyour ad also gets exposed to those who may not have noticed it the lasttime.\nWhat’s more, with each repetition of your message, your audience\nnaturally grows more familiar with your product and company. Andunless they have some reason to think otherwise, a feeling of accep-tance begins to grow. As this acceptance strengthens, an affinity beginsto develop. They, in essence, begin to feel comfortable with you. Thiscomfort leads to greater trust, which opens the door to the sale.\nRemember:  The aim of all advertising is to create marginal differences\nin consumer attitudes and perceptions . Through repetition, these small dif-\nferences can build into larger differences, and can often tip the balancein favor of the advertised brand.\nCan repetition be bad? Possibly. Research suggests that there’s an\noptimum level at which repetition is effective, but that beyond this levelit can lead to frustration and consumer “turn-off ” (Petty and Cacioppo,1979). In short, the study involved presenting arguments to collegestudents about increasing university spending. Some students heardthe argument once, others three times, the rest five times. Student whowere exposed to three repetitions backed the spending proposition. Inthe students who heard it five times, agreement dropped off consider-ably. Researchers Petty and Cacioppo suggested that at this high level\nof frequency, tedium may have set in, which caused the student toattack what they then considered to be an offensive communication.\nb02 cash ch 2.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 69\nCA$HVERTISING\n70Please don’t construe this to mean that you shouldn’t run your ads\nmore frequently than three times! Asking college kids about universityspending isn’t the same as advertising your products and services inyour local newspaper. I shared this example simply to make you awarethat endless repetition isn’t necessary a good thing, and to caution youto be sensitive to its use. Hey, just because you love your ad doesn’t\nmean your audience will. But if it’s making you money, by all means,keep it humming. Use repetition wisely and you’ll build brand familiar-ity. Overuse it, and you could be growing a bumper crop of consumercontempt.\nRun the same ad over and over, and you’re being repetitious. Run\ndifferent variations of the same ad, and you’re taking advantage of thepower of redundancy. This is a simple way to  extend the life span of an\neffective message or slogan. By presenting the same message in a differ-ent format and slightly different copy, you trick the reader into believ-ing he’s seeing a new ad rather than a recycled version of the one he sawlast week. It touches on what’s called multiple sources and multiple argu-\nments.  Simply put, the more different sources that expose a subject to\nthe same message, the more convinced the subject will become.\nIf, for example, you hear one women tell you how healthy it is to eat\nchocolate every day, you’ll either believe or not, depending how theidea strikes you at the time. (And how long it’s been since your last barof—yum—Perugina!) However, if five different people approach youthroughout the day and tell you a similar, but slightly different versionof this argument, chances are it’ll have serious impact on your beliefsystem, and you are much more likely to adopt this delicious idea asyour own.\nPrinciple #15: Rhetorical Questions —\nInteresting, Aren’t They?\nThe rhetorical question  is really a statement disguised as a question.\nPretty  sneaky, isn’t it? (Another example.) Not a new technique by any\nmeans, it was even mentioned in Aristotle’s classic guide to oratoricalskills, The Art of Rhetoric  (circa 330\nBC, first published in 1926). Televi-\nsion attorneys are known for using rhetorical questions during crossexamination to pressure their opponents, throw them off balance, andadd an air of veracity to their arguments. For example, “And isn’t it trueyou stuck the dinner fork in his eye just minutes after you threw thecheese wheel at his head?” Other examples of this principle:\nb02 cash ch 2.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 70\nHow to Get Inside Their Heads\n71✸Dial soap commercials asked,  “Aren’t you glad you use\nDial? Don’t you wish everyone did?”\n✸In 1926, newspaper ads for the laundry detergent Rinso\nasked, “Who else wants a whiter wash—with no hardwork?”\n✸Rolaids posed the question, “How do you spell relief?”\n✸And W.B. Doner—the largest independently owned\nadvertising agency in North America—is apparently a fanof the rhetorical, in its catchy, “What would you do for aKlondike Bar?” campaign.  (Personally, I’d do plenty for\nanything covered in chocolate, but let’s stay on topichere.)\nThis simple technique allows advertisers to make factual-sounding,\npossibly persuasive claims without having to support them with factualevidence or logical argument. Some research suggests that using rhe-torical questions can sometimes  change how people think, and modify\ntheir buying behavior. The idea is, if consumers aren’t thinking care-fully about an advertiser’s message, slipping in a rhetorical questiongrabs their attention and encourages them to fire up some brain cellsand think about the message.\nAccording to McCroskey (1986), “The reason for this is due to our\nsocial training. When somebody asks us a question, it is required thatwe respond to it. To respond correctly requires that we understand thequestion.”\nBottom line:  The listener or reader makes a conscious attempt to\nconsider the advertiser’s message, which increases the likelihood of suc-cessful persuasion.\nRespected communication researcher Dolf Zillmann conducted the\nfirst of only a few published studies on the topic in 1972. Several otherresearchers followed. And although the whole idea sounds great, thereis, unfortunately, not much agreement as to the effectiveness of thetechnique.\nSome say, “Y es! It works!” (Burkrant and Howard, 1984; Enzle and\nHarvey, 1982; Howard, 1990; Howard and Kerin, 1994; Petty, Cacioppo,and Heesaker, 1981; Swasy and Munch, 1985; Zillmann, 1972; Zillmannand Cantor, 1974). Resu lts from other studies say, “Nope, it’s not particu-\nlarly effective in all situations.”  (Cantor, 1979; Munch, Boller, and Swasy,\n1993; Munch and Swasy, 1988; Pentony, 1990.) In 1998, research ers Gayle,\nb02 cash ch 2.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 71\nCA$HVERTISING\n72Preiss, and Allen analyzed the currently available research on the topic\nand concluded that rhetorical questions have “no appreciable influ-ence on persuasion.” Other research suggests that the technique couldmake your audience feel pressured and persuaded, and therefore causethem to look more critically at your message and regard you as less of anauthority on the topic (Swasy and Munch, 1985).\nSigh. With all this research, isn’t there anything  on which we can all\nagree regarding rhetorical questions? Perhaps just this: the use of rhe-torical questions may be beneficial for increasing message retention . Ques-\ntions designed to emphasize a point, rather than to persuade, are likelyto cause your audience to remember your message. Makes sense, right?The more you think about something, the more brain cells you devoteto it, and the more likely you are to remember it.\nPrinciple #16: Evidence—\nQuick! Sell Me the Facts!\nWhenever I sit down to write an ad, I know that, unless I can con-\nvince you to believe me, you’re not going to log into PayPal and makemy bank account grow fatter. That means that my words are responsiblefor taking you from your present state of belief, disbelief, or ignorance,and convincing you that what I’m selling is worth more than the moneyin your pocket.\nDid you ever think of it that way? It’s a good context in which to\nhold your products and services. People buy from you when they believe\nwhat you are selling is of greater value than the dollars they need toexchange for it. For example, in my advertising workshop, I say, “Let’sdo a little experiment in consumer psychology.”  I hold up a #10 enve-\nlope with a big question mark printed on it, and ask, “Does anyonehave a $20 bill?” Several people raise their hands. I choose one person,walk over to her, and ask the following question: “If I asked you to trademe your $20 for what’s inside this envelope, what is the one questionyou might want to ask me before making the trade, knowing that oncewe make the deal, you can’t get your money back?”\nInvariably, the participant responds, “What’s in the envelope?” No\nmatter where in the country I deliver the workshop, when I make thatoffer, participants will always ask that same logical question: “What’s inthe envelope?”\nb02 cash ch 2.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 72\nHow to Get Inside Their Heads\n73What does this tell us? It tells us that consumers all think the same\nthing before making any purchase decision. They all want to know onething before they exchange anything of value, whether it’s time, materi-als, or money. They all want to know what they’re  going to get out of the\ndeal. They all want to know the answer to the big question, “What’s in itfor me?” or the acronym, “WIIFM.” Until they know the WIIFM, they’renot only hesitant to make the deal, but they’re also reluctant to evenraise their hands in response to my question asking if they have a $20bill! This hints at the fear that accompanies many buying decisions: the\nfear of loss. (Re-read that last sentence.)\nNext—and notice the contrast with this experiment—I hold up a\nplastic bag with a $20 bill clearly visible. I asked the audience, “Whowould like to trade their $1 bill for this bag containing a $20 bill?” Notsurprisingly, dozens of hands spring up, as if I just offered to toss goldKrugerrands to the first person who can catch them. In this example,the audience—these consumers —demonstrated that once they knew the\nWIIFM, the benefit to them, they were much more likely to exchangetheir money for what was in the bag. This is the best way I know todemonstrate the foundational principle of advertising: telling your pros-pects the benefits of what you’re selling. They must, must, must beconvinced that what’s in “your bag” is worth more than the money youask for it, or the deal won’t happen.\nAll right, so we know we have to convince our prospects of the value\nof what we’re selling. To convince means to cause belief. So how do we\nget them to believe? One great, proven way is by offering persuasiveevidence. Here’s the definition of evidence  in 19 words: “Any factual\nstatement, object, or opinion not created by a source that is used by thatsource as support”  (Reinhard, 1988). More simply, evidence can be facts,\nfigures, testimonials, endorsements, research, charts, videos—you nameit—as long as you, the advertiser, didn’t create it yourself.\nThere’s no doubt about it: Research concludes that evidence works,\nand works well. Advertisers who use solid evidence persuade more ef-fectively than those who use poor evidence or none at all. Let’s face it:You can’t create an ad loaded with a slew of benefits and simply expectpeople to believe what you write. When they first see your ad, they knowfull well that you’re trying to sell them. If what you’re offering is some-thing in which they’re interested, they want to believe your claims. That’s\nbecause believing your claims and purchasing your product may leadthem to enjoy the benefits you’re promising. It’s like going to a personal\nb02 cash ch 2.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 73\nCA$HVERTISING\n74development seminar and watching a professional speaker. You’re not\nsitting there hoping the speaker screws up. You want him or her to per-\nform well. You want him or her to speak powerfully, to move you, and\nperhaps even change your life for the better.\nLikewise, if what you’re selling promises to either to resolve a prob-\nlem I’m experiencing or in some way better my life, I want to be con-\nvinced that it will work as you say it will. But at the same time—and thisis why the cash register doesn’t ring every time— I don’t want to be ripped\noff. It’s up to you to appeal effectively to my emotions to get me excited\nenough to spend the money. It’s also up to you, especially for a costlierproduct, to supply enough reasoning so I can justify the expenditure ofmy money, thereby satisfying my adult sense of responsibility. Strongevidence can do this. In addition to its persuasive effects, evidence alsocreates a positive impression of your company as one that offers “legiti-mate” goods and services. (After all, they were backed by evidence!)\nEvidence is most effective when we’re faced with buying important\nor expensive goods or services. In these situations, we’re primed to thinkcarefully about our purchases and consider the arguments and issuesinvolved. As a nice added benefit, deep, reasoned (central route) think-ing can produce a long-term change in your prospect’s attitude that’sresistant to the sales messages of your competitors. Isn’t that a nicebenefit?\nInterestingly enough, even peripheral (superficial) thinkers are in-\nfluenced by strong evidence. When faced with facts and figures, testi-monials and charts, these thinkers say, “Wow...look at all these facts andfigures. It’s got to be true!”\nCA$HVERTISING Tip:  In order to influence our peripheral-thinking\nfriends, make sure you present your evidence in a clear and easy-to-grasp manner. Peripheral thinkers will not take the time to figure outwhat you’re trying to say. They’ll look at your data, and—boom!—makea decision as to what it means. Therefore, you should feature colorfulcharts and graphs, and facts, figures, and quotes from respected intel-lectuals and professionals.\nOnce a salesperson has you “cornered,” he can unleash his full ar-\nsenal of sales techniques on you. In print ads, you have a limited amountof space to make your point, and a limited amount of time to grab yourreaders’ attention and hold it throughout your sales pitch. The finalprinciple exploits these time limitations by encouraging the reader touse psychologically powerful mental shortcuts called heuristics .\nb02 cash ch 2.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 74\nHow to Get Inside Their Heads\n75Principle #17: Heuristics —————\nServing Billions of Lazy Brains Daily\nFirst, let’s overcome our fear of the strange word heuristics . Pro-\nnounced “hyu-RIS-tiks,” it’s a derivative of the Greek word heuriskein\nmeaning “to discover.” Heuristics pertain to the process of gaining (ordiscovering) knowledge, not by critical thinking and reasoning, but byintelligent guesswork. We referred to this process earlier by the lesstongue-twisting term, cues, when we specifically discussed the six-cue\nCLARCCS model popularized by social psychologist Robert Cialdini.\nWell, not to be outdone, researchers Stec and Bernstein (1999) put\nforth their own brand of persuasion heuristics, three of them to be ex-act: the Length-Implies-Strength Heuristic , the Liking-Agreement  Heuristic —\naffectionately known as Balance Theory —and the Consensus-Implies-Correctness\nHeuristic . We’ll explore only the first principle— Length-Implies-Strength —\nbecause we already covered the other two in our discussion of Cialdini’ssix weapons of influence: liking and comparison, respectively.\nLet’s face it: We humans are lazy creatures. Most of us prefer to take\nthe quickest route to arriving at decisions, because doing so eliminatesthe hard work—the “pain” of thinking, and the need to consider all thecomplex or overwhelming details. If we can make a decision quickly,then we can get back to doing more fun stuff, such as watching ridicu-lous videos on YouTube. And when it comes to using our brains, formany of us, most anything  is more pleasurable than engaging in deep\nthought. Inventor-genius Thomas Edison said it best: “There is no ex-pedient to which a man will not go to avoid the labor of thinking.”\nHeuristic decision-making to the rescue! You see, if we’re exposed\nto the right type of information, our “mental trains” will stay on theirperipheral processing tracks and pull into the station fully prepared tomake a decision in seconds or minutes instead of hours, days, or longer.In addition to Cialdini’s six cues, there are a number of heuristics thatpsychologists and resear chers have identified, but not all are as readily\napplicable in advertising. The following heuristic, however, is one of themost popular—and effective—and you can start using it immediately.\nThe Length-Implies-Strength Heuristic is a principle that exerts an\ninfluence similar to evidence . It’s based on the assumption that a prod-\nuct or service is more likely to be viewed favorably if the ad is long andcontains numerous, credible facts and figures. It causes your prospectto say, in effect, “Wow...look how much is here. It must be true.” It’s\nb02 cash ch 2.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 75\nCA$HVERTISING\n76similar to listening to someone speak at length about a particular topic.\nEventually, when you’ve heard enough—as long as the presentation wasreasonably polished—you’d probably feel that the speaker knew whathe was talking about. After all, “He went on for so long!” Of courselength itself doesn’t mean something is truthful, but that is exactly howthis principle works.\nLoading your ads with testimonials is one way to tune your pros-\npects’ brains to “Heuristic Channel #1.” Another way is to write long,engaging copy. Not only does long copy give you more opportunities topersuade, but it also has the effect of causing prospects to believe thatbecause there’s so much copy, there must be something to it! This is thevery essence of the Length-Implies-Strength heuristic.\nHow many photos of satisfied customers do you have? Put them in\nyour ads, brochures, and sales letters, and on your Website. Show justone photo, and it communicates little more than you have one satisfied\ncustomer. Show dozens of them, and it produces a powerfully positiveperception of credibility and certainty about your claims by quantityalone.\nRemember my client Jay Siff of Moving Targets? He sends his pros-\npects a four-page full-color brochure called “101 Success Stories.” Itcontains—you guessed it—101 testimonials and photographs from cli-ents who rave about his service. It impossible to not be impressed bythis brochure. Even if you didn’t read the rest of the information thataccompanies this sales piece, you’d be instantly inclined to believe thatthe service he promotes actually works. Not only does it work likegangbusters—and yes, it really does—but even 101 people said so!\nTo promote my advertising workshop, I created a one-page, 8 1/2 ×\n14-inch flyer that I call my “Speak Out!” sheet. The page is dividedinto three narrow columns and is jam-packed with quotes from partici-pants, including their names, business names, cities, and states. At thetop of the page, in the upper left-hand corner, is my photograph. Thebig and bold headline, to its right, says:\nParticipants Speak Out!Participants Speak Out!Participants Speak Out!Participants Speak Out!Participants Speak Out!\nHere’s What they’re Saying AboutHere’s What they’re Saying AboutHere’s What they’re Saying AboutHere’s What they’re Saying AboutHere’s What they’re Saying About\nDrew Eric Whitman’s CA$HVERTISING Workshop:Drew Eric Whitman’s CA$HVERTISING Workshop:Drew Eric Whitman’s CA$HVERTISING Workshop:Drew Eric Whitman’s CA$HVERTISING Workshop:Drew Eric Whitman’s CA$HVERTISING Workshop:\nb02 cash ch 2.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 76\nHow to Get Inside Their Heads\n77It’s packed with so many glowing testimonials that by the time you’re\nfinished reading, or merely scanning this flyer, your head is spinning!You “know”—heuristically, at least—that there must be something to it.\nHow many good reasons can you give prospects to buy your prod-\nuct or service? Simple lists are powerful. In my work for Day-Timers, Igave prospects 22 good reasons why they should buy the great Day-Timer organizer. It hit them from most every angle. If you had even theslightest penchant for organizing your life, this list would (1) get youexcited about the many benefits you’d enjoy, and (2) help convince youthat the product has real merit because of the 22 reasons I listed to buy it.\nYour prospect might be able to discount a few of the things you\nthrow at them. But if you provide enough information, the Length-Implies-Strength heuristic will kick in and save the day. “Look how longthis list is! Maybe a couple of these things aren’t completely factual, butthis one looks right...and this one is cool...and hey, this benefit wouldbe helpful.”\nA politician stands in front of a crowd and pulls out a 50-page docu-\nment that he proclaims contains more than 200 examples of how hisopponent, Ted Torpy, flip-flopped on critical issues facing the nation.He cracks open the document and starts reading off one damning flip-flopped quote after another, vocally numbering each one in an effort toimpress upon his audience the scope and problematic quantity  of his\nopponent’s worrisome trait.

While working to improve the incan-\ndescent electrical lamp (existing ones didn’t burn long enough or weretoo bright for small spaces), Edison and his associates tested more than3,000 different theories and thousands of plant materials.\n“Before I got through,” Edison said, “I tested no fewer than 6,000\nvegetable growths, and ransacked the world for the most suitable fila-ment material.” Whew!  At what point would you have given up?\n“Fascinating, Drew, but why the history lesson?” To make a point. If\nfor some wacky reason you wanted to build your own light bulb, insteadof spending years duplicating Edison’s thousands of failed experiments,wouldn’t it be wiser to read his lab notes and see how he did it?

You’d simply duplicate what he did, rapidly produce a\nlong-lasting light bulb, and get on with your life. Whenever you studysomeone who was successful at a task you’re preparing to attempt, youpave yourself an incredible shortcut to success.\nThe same applies to your advertising. There’s no need for you to\nspend years and thousands of your own dollars experimenting, whenthousands of Edisons have already done it for you. If you like experi-menting, knock yourself out. On the other hand, if you want resultsnow, why not save yourself the trouble and simply do what works? Life’s\ntoo short.\nThe following 41 techniques are backed by decades of real-world\ntesting by ad-agency professionals, marketing experts, and scores ofdedicated consumer and social psychologists. And most importantly toyou and me, each technique has been proven effective in the only placeit really matters: the real world .\nFact: By the time you’ve finished reading CA$HVERTISING , you’ll\nknow more about how to create powerfully effective, money-making ad-\nvertising than 99 percent of your competitors will know in their entire\ncareers— guaranteed.  Now let’s get started.\nAd-Agency Secret #1:\nThe Psychology of Simplicity\nStop reading this book. Because if you don’t follow the advice of\nthis first lesson, no matter how wonderful your product, your advertis-ing will likely fail. Miserably. It’s the foundation for everything else I’mgoing to teach you. It’s like telling a first-time boxing student that les-son #1 is “How to stand.” Boring? Maybe, but if he skips this lessonbecause “It’s boring!” he’ll probably get his head blasted off his shoul-ders the first time he steps into the ring.  And although the lesson might\nbe obvious, it’s still vitally important. If you treat this first topic lightly,your ads (and your business)—just like that newbie boxer—will likelysuffer one painful knock-out after another. It’s as simple as that.\nFact:  The goal of advertising is to get people to act. And the tools\nwe use to create printed advertising (as opposed to TV and radio) arewords  (as opposed to sound and moving images). So, doesn’t it logically\nfollow that, in order for our ads to be effective, we need to use our words\neffectively? Of course. And using words effectively means we must writeso our audience understands  what we’re saying. As simple as it is, my\nb03 cash ch 3.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 80\nAd-Agency Secrets\n81friend, you’ve just learned the #1 key to all effective written communi-\ncation: Write so people can understand . This idea is based on  Consumer\nPsychology Principle #11, “Message Organization.”\nWrite to the chimpanzee brain. Simply. Directly.\n—Eugene Schwartz\nLet’s face it: You could have the greatest invention since indoor\nplumbing, but if no one understands what the heck you’re trying to sayabout it, you may as well have the crappiest one. What’s the difference?In either case, they’re not buying. Effective communication doesn’t hap-\npen until the people to whom you’re trying to communicate understand\nyour message. Just because you’re running an ad in a newspaper ormagazine, or your Website is online, doesn’t mean you’re communicat-ing effectively . You are advertising, I’ll give you that. But until someone\nreads and understands  it, you’re just talking to yourself. And you don’t\nneed to spend a penny to do that. (I talk to myself quite often, so Iknow.)\nIt’s one thing to try to write simply; quite another to actually do it.\nAnd short of doing your own testing—asking friends, neighbors, andfamily members to read your sales copy—it’s tough to get a real sense ofjust how readable your copy really  is. Dr. Rudolf Flesch to the rescue!\nThe Flesch Reading Ease Formula\nIn his book, The Art of Plain Talk , Dr. Rudolph Flesch analyzes what\nmakes writing easy or difficult to read. In the early 1940s he developeda formula to determine readability that we still use today, nearly 70 yearslater. If you use Microsoft Word, accessing your Flesch Reading EaseScore (FRES) is just a button-click away. Based on a scale of 1 to 100,the higher your score, the easier the reading. If you’re a math lover, oryou just want to understand how the formula works, here are the fivesteps. (If you’re a masochist, you can calculate the formula manually.)\nStep #1—Count the words: Count as single words contractions,\nhyphenated words, abbreviations, figures, symbols and their combina tions.\nFor example,  shouldn’t, extra-rich, TV , 12, &, $17, 5%.\nb03 cash ch 3.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 81\nCA$HVERTISING\n82Step #2—Count the syllables: Count the syllables in words as you’d\npronounce them. Count abbreviations, figures, symbols, and their com-binations as one-syllable words. If a word has two accepted pronuncia-tions, use the one with fewer syllables. Unsure? Grab a dictionary.\nStep #3—Count the sentences: Count as a sentence each full unit\nof speech that’s separated by a period, colon, semicolon, question mark,exclamation point, or dash. Ignore paragraph breaks, colons, semico-lons, initial capitals, or dashes occurring within a sentence.\nStep #4—Determine the average number of syllables per word:\nDivide the total syllables by the number of words.\nStep #5—Figure the average number of words per sentence:\nDivide the number of words by the number of sentences.\nThe result— whew! —is your readability score.\nYour ad gets only a fraction of their\nintelligence...people won’t study your ad carefully.\nThey can’t be bothered. And so you have to make\nyour ads simple.\n—John Caples\nFlesch gives an excellent example of how complexity affects score.\nThe sentence, “John loves Mary” scores 92— very easy. Now let’s crank\nup the difficulty. “John has a profound affection for Mary.” Not quite assimply said or as specific, is it? Score: 67. Not too bad, but definitely\nheaded in the wrong direction. Now the worst: “Even though John isnot normally given to a display of his deeper emotions, he allegedly hasdeveloped a profound affection for Mary, as compared to the more eq-uable feelings he seems to have for Lucy, Fran, and, to a lesser extent,Sue.” Ugh...what a wordy mess! Score: 32— difficult . See what happened ?\nIt degraded into vagary, complexity, and added a whopping 36 hard-to-read words. It’s now comparable in reading difficulty to the Harvard\nLaw Review . You can be sure that Romeo never expressed his affection\nfor Juliet this way!\nHow do the scores translate into school grades? According to Flesch,\nhere are the rankings:\nb03 cash ch 3.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 82\nAd-Agency Secrets\n83If your score’s too low, Flesch suggests to “shorten the words and\nsentences until you get the score you want.” In fact, for best readability,he recommends sentence length of approximately 11 words. You shouldalso refer to people (Bob, Eileen, he, him, she, her, and so on) at least 14times in every 100 words.\nNot to be outdone by Dr. Flesch, other researchers started popping\nup like springtime crocuses with their own readability indices. There’sthe Fog Index, which tells you the number of years of education yourreaders need in order to understand you; the Flesch-Kincaid Index,used by the U.S. Department of Defense to check readability of itsmind-numbingly dry forms and publications; the McLaughlin“SMOG” Fo rmula,  developed in 1969 by Harry McLaughlin, former\neditor of the London newspaper the Mirror ; the Forcast formula, devel-\noped for assessing U.S. Army technical manuals and forms; and others.\nPhooey!  There’s no need for you to calculate all this yourself. I let\nmy computer do the work—the very same computer I’m using rightnow to type the words you’re reading.\nCA$HVERTISING Tip:  Did you notice what just happened? By\ncommenting on the context  of what’s going on, specifically, you reading\nthis book, teamed with the implication that I’m “on the other side ofthe writing” using my computer, I’ve shaken you out of your readingroutine a bit, haven’t I?

Which is easiest? Which is mostclear? After you read both, I’ll tell you what the computer analysis said.\nTest Paragraph #1Test Paragraph #1Test Paragraph #1Test Paragraph #1Test Paragraph #1\n“Would you like to make $10,000 a month making your\nown ice cream?

Although Test Paragraph #1 contains more\nsentences, Test Paragraph #2 features much longer sentences...over 12words longer each. Longer sentences mean longer thoughts, which re-quires more mental effort to follow them. The more you ask people tothink, the more likely you’ll lose them.\nWhat’s more, Test Paragraph #1 uses shorter words. But where’s\nthe biggest difference? In the Flesch Reading Ease Score and Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level. With its score of 72.1 (remember, 100 is best), TestParagraph #1 ranks with the easy-to-understand speaking you’d hearwatching your favorite movie. A 6th grader should be able to read andunderstand this passage. By contrast, Test Paragraph #2 scores simi-larly to the New York Review of Books, and is far  more difficult for the\naverage person to read and comprehend. With its low score of 34.1, it’sconsidered “college” reading level. And according to the U.S. Depart-ment of Education, National Center for Education Statistics: (1) In2007 only about 30 percent of 25- to 29-year-olds had completed abachelor’s degree or higher, and (2) Approximately 3.4 million 16- to24-year-olds were high school dropouts.\nRegardless of your prospects’ educational background, short words\nand short sentences make reading easier for everybody. (Of course, don’tuse all three-letter words and super-short sentences and paragraphs.\nVary them so your copy sounds natural, not robotic. A good rule ofthumb is that about 70 to 80 percent of your copy should consist ofone-syllable words.)\nThe software also checks for what Flesch calls definite words.  These\nare nouns, proper names, pronouns, verbs, and specifics. The morespecific you are, the less figuring your reader has to do in order to un-derstand your message. “Joey ate chocolate” is more definite than say-ing, “Someone did something.”\nDON’T SAY:DON’T SAY:DON’T SAY:DON’T SAY:DON’T SAY:\n“Become financially successful.”\nDODODODODO SAY: SAY: SAY: SAY: SAY:\n“You’ll make up to $2,495 every week.”\nDON’T SAY:DON’T SAY:DON’T SAY:DON’T SAY:DON’T SAY:\n“Want your entire body to look more appealing?”\nb03 cash ch 3.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 85\nCA$HVERTISING\n86DODODODODO SAY: SAY: SAY: SAY: SAY:\n“MEN!MEN!MEN!MEN!MEN! Do you want a rippling, rock-hard stomach?\nWOMEN!WOMEN!WOMEN!WOMEN!WOMEN! Do you want lean, luscious thighs?”\nWhoopee! Those headlines would knock ’em dead! So follow these\nfour simple prescriptions for highly readable writing.\nPrescription #1: Use Short, Simple Words\n“As I proceed to issue the following informational text, I hope that\nyou understand that the vast majority of individuals will, without ques-tion, proceed to issue forth a counter-opinion predicated upon the factthat their life experiences dictate just the opposite guidelines as thoseissued to them in good gesture. Unfortunately, in an atmosphere inwhich educational disciplines are of utmost importance, I hasten todictate the potential loss of data acquisition; however this is indeed theperceived and forecasted outcome of this quite burdensome situation.”\nDid you enjoy reading that last paragraph? Probably not. Why? Be-\ncause it sounds as if it were written by a constipated Harvard Law pro-fessor. And, according to the McLaughlin “SMOG” Formula , it’s written\non a post-graduate degree reading level, which is comparable to IRScode. Y awn. Unfortunately, more people write this way than you’d be-lieve. This is especially unfortunate when the person writes advertising !\nBut there’s a good reason why people write that way: that’s how many\npeople were taught to write!\nIn school, we were taught to write as adults. To talk with “big” words.\nSo the word tired became enervated . Hungry  became famished . Big became\nelephantine . Stubborn  became recalcitrant . Evil became nefarious . Sigh...you\nget the idea.\nBut do you see what has happened to you and me? Because we were\ntrained to write this way, we tend to write this way whenever we writeanything . This means that every time we write an ad, brochure, sales\nletter, e-mail, or Web page, we are, in effect, flushing our money downthe toilet. Why? Because nobody understands what the $@#!* we’re talking\nabout!\nForget those annoying $10 words and phrases you were taught in\nschool and business. You know the ones I mean: and you’ll enjoy same ,\nthe aforementioned benefits , you can liken this to , herein are 10 reasons , and\nany other of those tired, stodgy expressions. Just be clear, natural, andsimple.\nb03 cash ch 3.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 86\nAd-Agency Secrets\n87Prescription #2:\nThe Shorter Your Sentences, the Better\nIt’s easier to read short sentences, isn’t it? Sure is! It’s quick! Lively!\nExciting, too, wouldn’t you say? Chop your sentences down with a bigol’ ax. You’ll rivet people’s eyes to your sales copy, encouraging them toread more.\nRule of thumb:  Express only one thought in a sentence, no more.\nUse your next sentence to say the next thing. Why? Because it’s much\neasier for your readers to process and understand just one thought at atime. And because everything you say is important, you want them tounderstand each of your sales points, don’t you? Of course.\nSo do as the good Dr. Flesch suggests: (1) Use shorter words—70 to\n80 percent of them should consist of just one syllable, and (2) writeshorter sentences—aim for about 11 words each. People will read more.The more they read, the greater your chance of persuading them tobuy. The more they buy, the more money you make. Any questions?\nPrescription #3: The Short, Short Paragraph Trick\nHere’s a great trick used by today’s top copywriters to keep people\nreading and moving ahead at a quick pace. You simply ask a question ormake a quick statement, and then answer the question or continue thethought in the next paragraph in just a few words. Here’s an example.\nDear Bob,\nWould you like to know a secret way of making money\nby simply watching TV?\nI thought so.Now let me explain...\nNot only does this short-paragraph trick move your readers’ eyes\ndown the page, but it also quickens their pace and makes your ad orletter look much more inviting. (As opposed to a big, solid page full of\ntext.) Don’t overdo this technique, or your writing will look too me-chanical. Limit your regular paragraphs to about four or five shortsentences.\nDrew Alan Kaplan knows this trick well. In his wildly popular dir ect-\nmail catalog of high-tech electronic gadgets, Kaplan writes extremelyengaging copy that sells products like hotcakes. He took a tiny business\nb03 cash ch 3.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 87\nCA$HVERTISING\n88run from his cramped dorm room at UCLA, and grew it into a slam-\nming 400-person sales machine that moved, for example, 450,000 ra-dar detectors, 250,000 stereo equalizers, 100,000 subwoofers, and900,000 bread makers. (Yours truly bought a radar detector, and I’mstill baking fresh bread today. Y ep, I’m a sucker for great copy.) In virtu-ally every one of his full-page catalog ads, he starts the first paragraphwith sentences consisting of only two to four words. Of the eight prod-ucts I just now reviewed on his Website, six of them use this technique:\n✸“I confess.”\n✸“We’re free.”\n✸“It’s tough.”\n✸“This is important.”\n✸“S.W.A.T . teams use them.”\n✸“It’s a problem.”\nIt’s a fast and easy way to lure people into your copy, and it’s sup-\nported by some of the biggest names in advertising.\nLimit your opening paragraph to a maximum\nof eleven words.\n—David Ogilvy\nPrescription #4:\nPile on the Personal Pronoun Personality\nFinally, I want you to load your copy with pronouns, such as you,\nme, I, he, she, him, they, and them. Be especially generous with the words\nyou and I. Pronouns give your copy a warm, human flavor that people\nnotice instantly. It helps turn your mass communication into personal\ncommunication, the most effective kind. In fact, It’s nearly impossibleto overuse the word you in well-written copy.  Generously sprinkle it\nthroughout like shaking parmesan cheese on a pizza. Start sentenceswith it! End sentences with it! Blow it up in big type! Put it in yourheadline! Ask questions and make statements using pronouns:\n“Do you...Can you...Would you...Should you...May I ask you a ques-\ntion? May I ask your advice? Can I get your opinion? Did you know...Let\nme tell you...I think you’ll  like this idea...”\nb03 cash ch 3.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 88\nAd-Agency Secrets\n89Okay, let’s review what you learned so far.\nYOU LEARNED that in order for your advertising to be successful,\nyou must first be aware of what blocks your readers from understand-ing your message.\nYOU LEARNED  that your readers don’t care about your big vo-\ncabulary, only what you can do for them. That means you use shorterwords, sentences, and paragraphs.\nYOU LEARNED  that advertising copy doesn’t have to follow all\nthe rules of a college composition. Your copy has one job: to sell, Sell,SELL!\nYOU LEARNED how to use questions to draw people into your\ncopy and keep them reading. Right?\nYOU LEARNED how to use pronouns, such as the words you and I\nto make your copy sound personal. And you now know an easy way todetermine the readability of your copy by using the Flesch formula.\nCA$HVERTISING Tip:  Do you see how I kept repeating the words\nyou learned  in the five preceding paragraphs? Paragraph leaders are a\npowerful way to increase reading speed and establish an upbeat tempoin your ads. The repetition increases the reader’s perception of volume,and, according the Length-Implies-Strength heuristic discussed inChapter 2—can help boost credibility. Other effective paragraph lead-ers are, “We Guarantee...,” “We Promise...,” “You’ll Receive...,” and simi-lar. And even if you really didn’t  learn all those things (despite my parroting\n“you learned”), the mere repetition of the word can cause you to doubtyour own feelings because “it’s so confident...it’s so specific...and thereare so many of them.”\nAd-Agency Secret #2:\nBombard Your Readers With Benefits\nLet’s now talk about the million-dollar secret for getting inside your\nreaders’ heads: benefits . Play close attention. If you don’t incorporate\nthis idea in all of your advertising, you may as well pack up now and try\na different business that sells to beings other than humans.\nRemember our discussion about the Life-Force 8 from Chapter 1?\nAs you may recall, the LF8 are the primary human desires that are hard-wired into our brains. These are powerful wants we’re biologically drivento fulfill, no matter who we are, where we live, or what we do. If yourproduct or service can satisfy one of these desires—or any of the nine\nb03 cash ch 3.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 89\nCA$HVERTISING\n90secondary wants—you have the making of killer benefit claims that can\nstart the sales ball rolling. The fact is, if you don’t put benefits in youradvertising, whether it’s an ad, brochure, sales letter, Website, or what-\never, then kiss your money goodbye!\nNow, before you start puckering up, let’s examine what a benefit  is,\nin advertising terms. Benefits are those things that offer your prospectsvalue. And as the word implies, they’re things that directly benefit notyou, but your prospect . Is a benefit the same as a feature? No! You must\nlearn the distinction. A feature  is simply a component of a product or\nservice. For example:\nPRODUCT: PRODUCT: PRODUCT: PRODUCT: PRODUCT: Rolls-Royce Phantom Coupé\nFEATURE: FEATURE: FEATURE: FEATURE: FEATURE: Top-grade, hand-selected      seat leathers.\nBENEFIT: BENEFIT: BENEFIT: BENEFIT: BENEFIT: Luxurious comfort in all climates.\nFEATURE: FEATURE: FEATURE: FEATURE: FEATURE: Deep-pile      Wilton lamb’s wool carpeting.\nBENEFIT: BENEFIT: BENEFIT: BENEFIT: BENEFIT: The rich softness underfoot and lush elegance.\nFEATURE: FEATURE: FEATURE: FEATURE: FEATURE: 453 horsepower, 6.75-liter V-12 engine.\nBENEFIT: BENEFIT: BENEFIT: BENEFIT: BENEFIT: Power, control, supreme reliability.\nFEATURE: FEATURE: FEATURE: FEATURE: FEATURE: Bold, dignified styling with artist Charles\nSykes’s “Spirit of Ecstasy” flying proudly on the hood.\nBENEFIT: BENEFIT: BENEFIT: BENEFIT: BENEFIT: The feeling of power, success, and that you’ve\n“arrived.”\nGet it? The features are the attributes . The benefits  are what you get\nfrom those attributes. The benefits are what entice people to buy. Re-member, the entire time people are reading your ads, they’re consciouslythinking, “WIIFM?”: “What’s In It For Me?” In fact, they can’t turn itoff! Over and over and over and over. It’s like a corrupt MP3 file thatnever stops repeating. By loading your ads with benefits, telling yourprospects how and what they gain, how their lives will improve, you’reanswering the “WIIFM” they’re continually trying to satisfy. And whenyou do, their desire for your product increases, and you’re on your wayto making a sale.\nConsumers buy based on what the product will do for\nthem, not on what ingredients it  has.\n—Newspaper Association of America\nb03 cash ch 3.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 90\nAd-Agency Secrets\n91In my workshop, I drive the point home with a popular (and often\nhilarious) two-person interaction called the “Feature-Benefit Exercise.”I pair up participants and ask one to play the role of the seller, and theother the prospect. The seller starts by telling the prospect one featureof his product or service. Then I instruct the prospect to respond witha loud and annoyed “BIG DEAL! What’s in it for me?” And to conveyjust how worthless it is to state only the product’s features , I instruct the\nprospect to simultaneously throw her hands in the air and give a look ofpure disgust while shouting this. The seller must begin his reply withthe words, “You benefit by....”\nHere’s a typical interaction.\nBusiness Owner:Business Owner:Business Owner:Business Owner:Business Owner: “My product is an ink-jet printer.

Likewise, the photos of your staff might beall warm and fuzzy, but until you’ve poured on the benefits, they won’tdo a damned thing to make your cash register ring. Pictures of yournewborn baby Tabatha? Forget it! Snapshot of your new cat Lu LuLemieux? Please! Benefits  are what your prospects really care about.\nBenefits tap into Consumer Psychology Principle #5: The Means-EndChain we covered in Chapter 2, which suggests to always focus on thecore benefits and positive end results.

Yikes!\nSolution: Put the one thing that’s most important to them in the\nplace where they’re most likely to see it: your headline. For example,let’s say you’re writing a headline for your restaurant workshop thatteaches waiters and waitresses how to boost their income.\nDON’T SAY:DON’T SAY:DON’T SAY:DON’T SAY:DON’T SAY:\n“Attention Food Servers: New Workshop Teaches You\nthe Tricks of the Trade!”\nDODODODODO SAY: SAY: SAY: SAY: SAY:\n“Attention Food Servers: New Workshop Teaches You\nHow to Boost Your Tips by 512%...or Your Money Back!”\nIf you’re an award-winning interior designer specializing in making\nordinary houses look like beautiful model homes:\nDON’T SAY:DON’T SAY:DON’T SAY:DON’T SAY:DON’T SAY:\n“Louise Taylor Designs Homes of Distinction”\nDistinction?

Your headline should immediately select the\naudience you want to hook. By contrast, I saw an ad in a local shopperpaper for a lighting supply store that featured the headline, “We’ll HelpYou Brighten Up Your Life and Save Big!” Ugh, what a waste. Why?Because it does nothing to select its audience. The ad could be forpaint, window cleaning, or even antidepressants! Instead, how aboutthe ridiculously simple headline, “Need Lamps?” Think about it. Whowould be attracted to a headline that says “Need Lamps?” Someonewho needs lamps, of course! The audience, in this case, is perfectlyselected. There’s no guessing for whom it’s meant.\nThe headline is the “ticket on the meat.” Use it to flag\ndown readers who are prospects for the kind of product\nyou are advertising.\n—David Ogilvy\nQuestion:  Is a longer or shorter headline more effective? Let’s again\nturn to psychology. Researchers have conducted hundreds of tests tosee just how much the average person can effectively “take in,” or payattention to. The results from all studies are similar. The average Joe orJane can process a maximum of five to nine numbers (George A. Miller,The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus T wo , 1956) in a “single act of\nattention.” Ever wonder why phone numbers are seven digits? Bell Tele-phone wanted to make them long enough to accommodate the most\nvariations, but short enough that people would remember them.\nb03 cash ch 3.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 94\nAd-Agency Secrets\n95Word-wise, most people can grasp the meaning of five to six words in a\nsingle glance.\nSo does this mean that short headlines get higher readership? Y es.\nAnd studies confirm it. That’s because the number of words in a head-line affects reading speed, and therefore affects how much of the head-line is read.\nHere’s an example to drive this point home. If you saw the newspa-\nper headline “WAR!” it takes no effort whatsoever to read and processit, does it? As long as you recognize the word, it communicates its mean-ing instantly. That’s why the readership is so high. Your eyeballs simplyhave to hit the word, and it’s as good as read. As you add words, you’removing in the opposite direction of speed, work, ease, and understanding.\nTake, for example, the headline, “War Was Declared Y esterday by\nthe Blordoni Tribe in the Nation of Kimbootu Against Its HistoricallyMore Aggressive Southern Neighbors, the WoopWoops.” It simply takesmore time and effort to pore through a longer headline such as this,despite the silly tribal names. It forces you to think more (and we know\nmost people would rather have cavities drilled than do that), and itadds more opportunities to get lost in meaning and boredom. That’swhy short headlines get higher readership.\nShort headlines enjoy higher readership than long\nheadlines. As headlines grow, readership shrinks.\n—Starch Research\nBut before you grab an ax and start chopping down your headlines\nlike an oak tree, realize that well-written long headlines can be—and\noften are—remarkably effective. In fact, some long-copy direct-responseads use extremely long headlines that often flow into extremely longsubheads, creating a head/sub introduction dozens of words long!\nA classic study of 2,500 ads appearing in the Saturday Evening Post\nwas conducted from 1939 to 1940 by researcher Harold J. Rudolph. Theresults show that the shorter the headline, the greater the readership.\nb03 cash ch 3.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 95\nCA$HVERTISING\n96In this study, the average readership of the shortest headline is about\n1/7th better than the longest. We see the biggest drop in headlines withmore than 12 words. According to Rudolf, “These findings, obviously,cannot be interpreted as an indication that a headline, to be consis-tently well read, need to only be short. Headline content  is undoubtedly\nthe major element affecting readership.”\nThe flip side? A short headline isn’t necessarily an effective  headline.\nYou can struggle just as much writing three words as you would 15, andyour ad could still flop. Oh, sure, you’d likely get higher readership with\nthe three-word headline because it takes no effort to read it, but thatdoesn’t mean you chose the right words. According to David Ogilvy,\nlonger headlines sell more products.\n“Okay, Drew. Now I’m even more confused!” Alright...let’s simplify:\n1.Always  put your biggest benefit in your headline.\n2. If you can write two equally effective headlines, the\nshorter one will likely be read by more people, all othervariables being the same.\nFor the purposes of practicality, never  ignore rule #1, and keep rule\n#2 in mind to maximize readership when creating your next ad.

And in my seminar, I give an example\nof a salesperson whom no business should ever tolerate. In a dry, bor-ing, and monotone voice, I say, “Now you just take your time makingthe purchase decision. No need to decide right away. Certainly this prod-uct will be available in the future whenever you’d like to buy it.”\nDo you see a problem here? By suggesting there’s no need to act\nnow, that salesperson gives your prospects no incentive to buy now.\nWe’re talking about human inertia . Simply put, inertia is an object’s resis-\ntance to a change in its current state of motion. Like sitting on a couchwatching Seinfeld  reruns—talk about inertia! It sometimes takes a miracle\nto get up, change your clothes, and go run on the treadmill.\nAs advertisers, we need to motivate people to take action right now .\nWe don’t want them to wait, or think about it, or put off the decisionuntil the “later” that never comes.You want them to whip out theircredit cards and order now. And it’s not simply a matter of asking  for the\norder—any good salesperson knows to do that. It’s a matter of gettingyour prospect to take action when the offer is presented to them . And you\ndo it by creating the perception of scarcity with powerful deadlines.\nTell people they can’t have something and they want it more than\never. Remember our discussion of CLARCCS, the “Six Weapons ofInfluence?” The final “S” in that acronym—as you may recall—standsfor scarcity , a powerful motivator. And it’s the fear of loss that gives dead-\nlines their power.\nCan you imagine creating a powerful ad, filled with excellent copy,\nwonderful graphics, the perfect appeal; your pricing is dead-on, it’sloaded with amazing testimonials, and it’s running in a publication thatyou know will bring excellent response. The only thing you missed isincluding a deadline. And it doesn’t matter whether you use a “hard”deadline (featuring a specific cut-off date), such as “Sale Ends August21st,” or a “soft” deadline, such as “Quantities are Strictly Limited”;the absence  of a deadline conveys that your offer is always available. And\nthis, more than anything else, connotes that there’s no need to buynow; that there’s plenty to go around.\nWhat do you think would happen if, starting tomorrow, all the world’s\nsalespeople began ending their presentations with the following phrase:\nb03 cash ch 3.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 97\nCA$HVERTISING\n98“You don’t need to buy this now. Take your time deciding. I’ll get back\nto you in the future to see what you’ve decided.” It would spell eco-nomic collapse on a scale the world has never known.\nAdvertising is persuasion. And the most critical time to persuade is\nwhen you’re asking for action. Always feature deadlines to discourageresponse-killing human inertia. There’s no skill involved. It couldn’t beeasier. But boy, is it ever powerful. Simply include standard phrasessuch as the following:\n✸Call Before April 5th\n✸Supplies Are Strictly Limited\n✸Offer Expires May 15\n✸Price Guaranteed Only Until August 3\n✸Offer Good Only Before 4 p.m.\n✸Seating Is Limited to 50 Participants\n✸NO Rain Checks Will Be Issued\n✸Good Only for the First 50 Callers\n...and whatever other variations you can dream up. If you haven’t\nbeen using deadlines, start tapping psychologist Robert Cialdini’sWeapon of Influence #6, scarcity, and you’ll immediately see the differ-ence it makes in your response.\nAd-Agency Secret #5: 22 Psychologically\nPotent Headline Starters\nReading headlines is a lot like driving and reading signs. If you see\na sign pointing in the direction you’re interested in traveling, you’ll stayon the road and keep motoring ahead. Otherwise, you’ll turn off andlook for a road that takes you where you want to go. Likewise, a headlinethat interests you will keep you reading. If the copy’s strong enough,perhaps you’ll also dig into your pocket and fork over some cash. Oth-erwise, you’ll quickly take another route: glance at the  other ads, turn\nthe page, or click to another Website. In which case, to the advertiser,you’re gone forever.\nThat’s why it’s critical that your headline do two things: (1) grab\ntheir attention, and (2) motivate them to keep reading. If it doesn’t\ndo both, you could be giving away free gold bars, and most people\nwouldn’t notice. That’s why word choice  is so important. Fortunately,\nwith the advice in Ad Agency Secret #3 “Put Your Biggest Benefit in\nb03 cash ch 3.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 98\nAd-Agency Secrets\n99Your Headline,” you know what to put in your headline. Now let’s talk\nabout how to say it.\nThere are four important qualities that a good\nheadline may possess. They are:1. Self-interest.\n2. News. 3. Curiosity. 4. Quick, easy way.\n—John Caples\nWho isn’t interested in themselves? To appeal to a consumer’s self-\ninterest, simply write a headline that promises a personal benefit: whiterteeth, higher income, healthier body, better relationships, and any oth-ers, especially those that tap into the Life-Force 8 desires discussed inChapter 1.\nPeople read the newspaper for news and other information. We’re\nnaturally interested in what’s new, what’s going on around us. Any timeyou can express your benefit with a news flavor, you add an extra zingthat’s very appealing. Your “news” can be as simple as announcing therelease or availability of your product, and the way it benefits your buyer.Or, for an e xtra touch of timeliness, tie your ad into curr ent events, weather,\nsports, or anything topical. “ATTENTION LOS ANGELES: PresentThis Coupon Below and Burgerilla Will Donate 10 Percent of Your Burger\nPurchases to Help Earthquake Victims—Now Through Friday.”\nCurious? Most people are. And a well-constructed headline can stir\nup enough curiosity to motivate them to keep reading, as in most of thefollowing headlines. However, please don’t get cutesy or clever withheadlines that don’t target the right audience, simply to hook eyeballs.The best example of this is the headline “SEX!” for ads that have asmuch to do with sex as do ads for PVC patio furniture. You don’t sim-ply want lots of eyeballs; you want the right eyeballs.\nThe following 22 tested headline starters can be used for most any\nproduct or service.

They’re dressed like thugs.\nThey have angry thug expressions. Scary thug teeth. Lousy thug shav-ing habits. And an overall aura of “thugosity.” Standing in the middleof these upstanding citizens is a dapper gentleman that looks like hejust stepped off his Gulfstream G550 private jet. Wow, does this guylook wealthy, or what? That suit! Those shoes! That million-dollar smile!\nQuestion:  Who stands out in the police lineup? Differences attract.\n“In a litter of 10 puppies, the purple pooch gets all the attention.”\nThugs and puppies aside, in advertising we know that one way to\nget people’s attention is via graphic design. Our goal isn’t to make ouradvertising look the way everyone else’s does. We want to stand out,don’t we? But how many advertisers actually do? Ver y few. Prove it to\nyourself. Stop reading for a moment and grab your local newspaper.What shape are most ads? Without ever seeing the paper you’re read-ing, I know that most are square, followed by rectangle. Over and over,and over...the same two shapes. Not because that’s what’s proven to bemost effective. (It hasn’t.) But simply because these shapes allow pub-lishers to optimize their sales space. It’s easy to fit them side by side.\nSo be a rebel, break away from the copycat pack, stand out on even\nthe most crowded newspaper pages by running an eye-grabbing circle\nad. The advertising industry publication Printer’s Ink  reported the ef-\nfectiveness of this simple technique decades ago, but few advertisersknow about it, and even fewer have ever used it. Instead of the typical\nb03 cash ch 3.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 103\nCA$HVERTISING\n104rectangle or square, have your ad set within a circular border. (Run your\ncopy the standard way; don’t curve it around the interior of the circle.)Circular ads get more attention and yours will stand out—dramatically—from your “square” competition.\nSimply ask your printer or newspaper (or better still, a graphic de-\nsigner) to set your copy in a circular border that fits into the square adspace size you’re buying. To emphasize the circle even more, fill withblack—or the color of your choice—everything from the outside edgeof the circle, all the way to the inside edges of the square that containsit. This leaves you with the entire inside of the circle for your copy.Because of its shape, you’ll naturally have more horizontal room in theexact center of the circle than you will at the top and bottom. It’s a realeye-catcher. And I don’t care how many other ads your ad is surroundedby, yours will stick out like a neon sign in a sea of sameness.\nSuccessful small-space ads exploited their unusual\nshapes to enhance the depiction of the product. Poor\nones tried to pack too much information into their ads\nand too little attention was paid to drawing in the\nreader in the first place.\n—“Great Newspaper Ads,”\nMarketing Magazine ,\nFebruary 5, 2001\nAd-Agency Secret #8:\nThe Reverse-Type  Pitfall\n“Oh no! Don’t reverse it! Stop! Don’t you dare print white letters on\na dark background!”\nYou may have heard this one, from graphic designers, copywriters,\ncreative directors, consultants, newspaper ad-sales reps, and otherknowledgeable advertising people. But have you ever asked them, “Whynot?” Chances are, they’ll tell you, “It’s harder to read,” and nothingfurther.\nHave you followed this advice? You should. Because the principle is\ngrounded in sound psychological principle and fact. How about yourWebsite? Your HTML ads? Your printed materials?\nThis no-no is called reversing  or knocking out  type. Unless your ad is\nsurrounded, literally crammed by other ads on a Website, newspaper\nb03 cash ch 3.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 104\nAd-Agency Secrets\n105page, or anywhere else, don’t do it. Studies show that reversing makes\nyour copy dramatically less readable. Why?\nBecause the eye is not accustomed to reading in reverse. Especially\nif the type is small. Unfortunately, I’ve seen everyone from tiny familyshops to giant corporations make this blunder. How many Websites haveyou seen on which the background is darker than the type? Very diffi-cult to read.\nException to the rule? Reversing out of a solid background can be\neffective with headlines when the type is large and the words are few;for example: “Free Chocolate Truffles!” or “Win This NewLamborghini!”\nThen again, you could probably print those headlines in yellow ink on\nwhite paper and they’d probably pull like crazy. But what’s the back-\nground of this long-repeated admonishment? Rather than just tellyou not to do it, you should understand why advertising professionals\ngive you this advice...even though most of them have no idea them-selves.\nExperiment #1:Mr. Holmes and His “Critical Sixty-Six”\nIn an article entitled “The Relative Legibility of Black Print and\nWhite Print,” published in the Journal of Applied Psychology  in 1931, a\nresearcher by the mysterious name of G. Holmes performed a test us-ing short words. Some words were printed in black ink on white paper,and others in white type on a black background. The same font andtype size was used for all words. Good ol’ Mr. Holmes displayed bothwords at a distance, far enough away so that his subjects could not readthem. He then said, in effect, “OK gang, move forward only as close asnecessary to read these words.”\nHis findings? G. discovered that words set black on white (not re-\nversed) could be read at a distance of about 66 inches, whereas thewhite on black (reversed) words could not be read until the subjectswere closer, approximately 55 inches. Bottom line? Reversing makes type\nless legible.\nExperiment #2:Daniel Starch and the Eyeball Slowdown\nOur advertising researcher friend Daniel Starch performed an ex-\nperiment that agreed with Holmes’s findings. Starch had participants\nb03 cash ch 3.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 105\nCA$HVERTISING\n106read a short, non-reversed passage. “Read this!” he barked. In fact, the\naverage participant read it at just faster than six words per second. Next,he had them read a passage printed in reverse. The speed? Just fasterthan four words per second, about two words per second slower  than\nnon-reversed printing. Bottom line? Reversing slows down reading.\nExperiment #3:\nWhen P&T Speak, Everyone Listens\nIt was time to bring in the top guns and get to the bottom of this\nwhole reverse-type issue. And in they came: two psychologists, Patersonand Tinker. The big dogs of advertising research. Wasting no time, theyrepeated Starch’s experiment, but with a twist that produced interest-ing results. When participants were shown the black-on-white versionand were then immediately shown the reversed version, the reversedpassage was proven to be 4 percent less legible. When they were onlyshown the reversed copy, it proved 16 percent less legible...statisticallysignificant in anyone’s book.\nVerdict? Don’t reverse it.

Only hard, northern spring wheat because of its excel-\nlent rising qualities, crisp exterior, and chewy interior crust. But whystop there? His sauce...ahhhh, now’s this is a thing of beauty. He refuses\nto use pre-prepared sauce (like his competitors), no sir. He crushes hisown tomatoes. (And not any old tomatoes, either. He insists on “Genu-ine San Marzano” tomatoes from Italy!)

It matters more thanever, especially because no one else is doing it. One of the most power-ful things you can do is educate your prospects about the specifics ofyour product or service. Once educated—assuming your product is atleast as good as the competition—they’ll better appreciate what you’reoffering. Think...what interesting story can you tell people about your\nproduct or service? How can you educate them about what you do orhow you do it?\nA Tale of Two Restaurants\nRestaurant #1, Luigi’s, tells you it has wonderful home cooking.\nChicken parmesan, spaghetti, manicotti, and more. Plus, a coupon. Y es,that’s the entire  ad. Gee guys, the idea in advertising is to stand out,\ndifferentiate yourself, and persuade people to take action. I give Luigi’scredit for the coupon, but the rest of the ad doesn’t give any compellingreasons to redeem it.\nNow let’s look at Restaurant #2, Fratelli’s. Similar to Luigi’s, they\nlist what they serve. They also give a coupon. But they do much more,by giving extreme specifics about their food. They differentiate them-selves in the marketplace by saying things people want to know:\n“We make our bread fresh every day, golden and crusty.\nOur pasta is made from scratch. We use only fresh herbsin all our recipes. Only pure, cold-pressed 100-percentvirgin olive oil is served. Spring water fills your glass,mellow Italian music fills the air, and softly glowingcandles light your table.”\nWow! Can you feel the difference? Y es...it’s actually a feeling.  You get\na better feeling for Fratelli’s. The ad tells you more. It’s not just tryingto sell you. It’s actually wooing you. The words put pictures in yourhead and cause you to demonstrate the food and atmosphere in yourhead long before you step through the door.\nHow many restaurants go this far to educate you about what they\ndo?

Can I tell them about theprocesses used, the time, money, and effort expended? How can I pointout the major advantages of my product and make people begin toquestion the quality of my competition?”\nHere’s how another business uses this technique.\nA Tale of Two Hardware Stores\nWhat do most independent hardware stores do in their ads? Very\nlittle. They’re often no more than business cards with a quick mentionof the few items they have on sale. Consider the copy from the follow-ing two ads.\nHardware Store #1:Hardware Store #1:Hardware Store #1:Hardware Store #1:Hardware Store #1:\nHammers, screwdrivers, power tools, home fix-up, lawn\nand garden equipment. Paulson’s has the hardware you’relooking for...at neighborhood-friendly prices!\nHardware Store #2:Hardware Store #2:Hardware Store #2:Hardware Store #2:Hardware Store #2:\nHandyman Jack’s is no ordinary hardware store. We’re\na Hardware Super Store! We carry 343 kinds of fasten-ers, 28 types of nails, 86 gauges of wire, 43 grit sizes ofsandpaper, 16 different styles of hammers, 28 kinds ofscrewdrivers, 47 types of keys, a daily inventory of354,000 bolts and screws, all the top-name power toolsfor less, and a no-nonsense, money-back guarantee ofcomplete satisfaction.\nQuestion:  If you needed hardware and you knew nothing about\neither of these stores except what you saw in the ad, and both storeswere about the same distance from your home...where would you go?The answer is obvious: Handyman Jack’s. Even if every other hardwarestore in the city carries the same exact merchandise, no one else says it.\nRemember: It’s not important that people need to know all that\ninformation. I mean, who really cares how many nails and bolts youhave, as long as you have what they want. But the psychology behindit—the Length-Implies-Strength heuristic—makes it tremendously po-tent. Because hardly any other store says these things, people judge theone who does say it to be better, more complete, more successful in some\nway.

He devel-\noped a simple layout formula that, if followed, results in eye-catchingads that win researcher Daniel Starch’s “most-noted award.” Called theTwo-Thirds/One-Third Principle—or, more affectionately, the “Ogilvy”—the top two thirds of the ad is one big photograph. The remaining thirdof the ad consists of the headline (directly under the photo) and thesales copy beneath the headline, often starting with a large “drop cap”—just as I did in this paragraph—to help lure readers’ eyes into your salesmessage. Your company logo tucks neatly into the lower-right corner.\nIf you start your body copy with a drop-initial, you\nincrease readership by an average of 13%.\n—David Ogilvy\nThere’s also the Reverse Ogilvy—the One-Third/Two-Thirds varia-\ntion, wherein the top third of the ad is a photo, a headline underneathit, and the remaining two thirds is sales copy. As before, you drop yourcompany logo in the lower-right corner. In both cases, the headline andbody copy become, in effect, a “caption” for the photo.\nPlace the headline under the visual, as the eye moves to\nthe picture first and then moves down.\n—Starch Research\nUnless you know the following fact, you may not appreciate just\nhow clever this layout is. Studies show that up to twice as many people read\ncaptions as body copy.  Ogilvy himself advised, “More people read the cap-\ntions under illustrations than read the body copy, so never use an illus-tration without putting a caption under it.” It’s a clever trick that’sstood the test of time and has helped many big companies becomeleaders in their respective industries. If it’s good enough for “The manin the Hathaway shirt” and Rolls-Royce, it’s likely good enough for youand me.\nb03 cash ch 3.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 110\nAd-Agency Secrets\n111Don’t run pictures without putting captions under them.\nPut a brief selling message or human interest message\nunder every illustration you use.\n—John Caples\nAd-Agency Secret #11:\nThe Psychology      of Typefaces\nTypefaces can be playful. Authoritative. Creative. Beautiful. Dra-\nmatic. Fancy. Odd. Refined. And yes, even downright hideous. Andbecause of this, different typefaces can color our messages with differ-ent meanings. For example, you wouldn’t advertise frilly women’s linge-rie using a headline set in dark, bold, and masculine Cooper Black. Onthe other hand, you wouldn’t advertise your hardcore bodybuilding gympacked with sweaty and grunting steroid-injecting monsters using Palace,a lovely, delicate, and wispy script font. Your ad would look ridiculous! Ofcourse, your product may not suggest a typeface that’s so categorically\nexpressive of any particular emotion or visual, but no matter what typestyleyou choose, just know that it will communicate something .\nIt is possible to blow away three-quarters\nof our readers simply by choosing the wrong\ntype. If you rely on words to sell, that should\nconcern you deeply.\n—Colin Wheildon, author of\nType & Layout: Are You\nCommunicating or Just Making Pretty Shapes?\nIn addition to dozens of studies done in the past few decades, sev-\neral recent tests have been conducted to determine which typestyles areeasiest to read. I’ve heard a few people say, “Whatever you’re used toreading is what’s easiest for you.”\nHogwash! Of course some typefaces are easier to read than others;\nit’s ridiculous to say otherwise. Still, you can get used to scrubbing your\ndirty clothes on a rock, but that doesn’t mean that pressing “start” onyour washing machine isn’t easier.\nb03 cash ch 3.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 111\nCA$HVERTISING\n112Consider the typeface called Flag Day. Each letter looks like a little\nwaving flag consisting of alternating and undulating horizontal blackand white stripes. It’s one of the most difficult-to-read typefaces I’veseen. At 24 points and under, I can’t read it. Larger than 24 points, I still\ncan’t read it. Even when I type my own name, I might as well have typedthe random words “Spinning Flounder Ape.” Now, I don’t care howmany typeface studies you conducted, the fact is, Flag Day is extremelydifficult to read because the letters simply don’t look like letters, butwiggly striped blobs. I’m sure you could  get used to it. But that doesn’t\nmean that a clearer, plainer font such as Arial wouldn’t be far morereadable. Saying otherwise is like saying, “Heck, I’ve been using thesame dull razor blade for 28 years...using a brand new one wouldn’t beany easier; I’m already used to the old dull one!” Huh?\nSerif or Sans Serif for Printed Matter?\nDo you know the difference between a serif and a sans serif type-\nface? Your eye certainly does. A serif typeface is one that has littlefeet and embellishments on the tips and base of each letter, suchas this font. Sans (the French word “without”) serif faces, such as this\nfont, have no such serifs. The serifs make each letter more distinct and\nrecognizable.\nMultiple researchers confirm that serif fonts make words easier to\nread. (Wordon, 1991; Hartley, 1994). Examples of serif fonts are TimesNew Roman, Palatino, Schoolbook, Georgia, Courier, Cheltenham,Bookman, and Garamond.\nIn 1926, The British Medical Council reported that sans serif type\ncauses irradiation : an optical anomaly in which space between lines in-\ntruded into letters, creating a type of light-vibration that made readingmore difficult and uncomfortable.\nIn a study of comprehension, Wheildon (1986) noted that only 12\npercent of participants effectively comprehended a passage set insans serif type, versus 67 percent of readers given a version set in aserif typeface. Those given the sans serif version said they had atough time reading the text and had to “continually back-track to re gain\ncomprehension.”\nIn a substantial test of several hundred thousand readers, Wheildon\nset one ad in three different faces: Garamond, Times Roman (both serif),and Helvetica (sans serif). Here’s what he found:\nb03 cash ch 3.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 112\nAd-Agency Secrets\n113✸Garamond was read and comprehended by 670,000\npeople—66 percent of the test subjects.\n✸Times Roman was comprehended by 320,000—less than\nhalf of Garamond.\n✸Helvetica was comprehended by only 120,000 people—\n12.5 percent of the subjects.\nBottom line:  Serif fonts—at least on paper—are simply easier to\nread. The findings are the same for virtually every researcher who’s everconducted the test. No wonder most newspaper and magazine pub-lishers set their body copy in a serif typeface.\n“Okay Drew, I get it, but which specific  serif typeface should I use?”\nAhhh, now that question opens an entirely new can of worms. Unfortu-\nnately, I’ve seen no research that gives a definitive answer. And my stud-ies go back as far as 1912—yikes!—when B.E. Roethlin wrote the article,“The Relative Legibility of Different Typefaces of Printing Types,” inthe American Journal of Psychology . (Good luck Googling that!)\nThe closest was a study by Paterson and Tinker (1932) that revealed\nno discernable differences in reading speed among the group of facesthey studied, with the exception of two styles that slowed readers: CloisterBlack (Old English), by 16.5 percent, and American Typewriter, by 5.1percent.\nThat’s not to say that people don’t have their opinions.\nJohn McWade, publisher of Before & After  magazine, likes:  Adobe\nCaslon, Adobe Garamond, ITC Stone Serif, and Janson Text 55 Roman.\nCoauthors James Craig, Irene Korol Scala, and William\nBevington, of Designing With Type: The Essential Guide to Typography,\nsay, “Baskerville is considered one of the most pleasant and readable\ntypefaces.”\nAdvertising copy great John Caples  liked using Cheltenham Bold\nfor headlines.\nDavid Ogilvy preferred the Century family, Caslon, Baskerville, and\nJenson.\nDirect marketing guru Gary Halbert swore by Courier for sales\nletters.\nYours truly often uses Clearface Black for headlines and School-\nbook for body copy.\nb03 cash ch 3.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 113\nCA$HVERTISING\n114Ascender Corporation’s study “Fonts on the Front Page” revealed\nthe 10 most popular typefaces used by the top 100 U.S newspapers (bycirculation), in order:\n1.

Miller.\nUntil research says otherwise, using any of the serif fonts suggested\nhere will not only put you in good company, but will also help you cre-ate attractive, more readable sales materials.\nSet Headlines in Initial Caps\nHeadlines Longer Than Just a Couple of Words, Such As “FREE\nCOOKIES!”  Should Be Set in Initial Caps , a Combination of Upper-\nand Lower-Case Letters, As in This Sentence. All upper-case lettersslowed readership by 11.8 percent (Paterson and Tinker, 1956).\nNew York Times  editor Theodore Bernstein challenged Patterson and\nTinker’s findings and said headlines set in all caps could be read faster.\nThe battle raged. And when the smoke cleared, poor Mr. Bernstein atehis caps.\nResults:  An 18.9 percent difference in favor of initial cap head lines—\neven greater than Patterson and Tinker found in their study. Gulp.\nBut wait! Tinker wasn’t done. He was so fascinated by this whole\ncaps/lower case issue that he conducted a test to see if how much aperson blinked—yes, blinked —could be a reliable measure of readability\n(Tinker, 1946).\nResults:  All capital letters slowed reading—no surprise there—but\nhe struck no gold with his eyelid-driven “blinky-blink” hypothesis.\nBut why do all caps slow reading? Because the eye recognizes by\noutline .\nb03 cash ch 3.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 114\nAd-Agency Secrets\n115Try this test:  Draw a line around the following two words: ADVER-\nTISING POWER, allowing your pen to touch the tops and bottoms ofeach letter. The resultant shape is a rectangle, with even sides all around.Now draw a line around the following two words set in initial caps, againallowing your pen to touch the tops and bottoms of each letter: Ad-vertising Power. Your pen rises and falls like a roller coaster as it goes overthe capital letters and the ascenders and descenders of the other letters.\nResults:  More distinct and recognizable letters and words. This trans-\nlates into easier and faster reading.\nSerif or Sans Serif for Online Reading?\nWhat looks good on paper doesn’t necessarily read well on screen.\nThe difference? Resolution. For example, books, newspapers, flyers, andbrochures are typically printed in 300 dots-per-inch (dpi) resolution. Ifyou have a Mac (or MacOS compatible), you have a 72 dpi screen. Ifyou have a Windows PC, you have a 96 dpi screen. What looks good inone medium doesn’t look great in another.\nGoogle the topic, and you’ll discover more online font readability\ntests than you’d believe anyone  had interest in. I’ll share the bottom-line\nresults of a few of them, and then give you a recommendation thatconsiders all the findings.\nSome researchers used proofreading to determine readability, such\nas Tullis, Boynton, & Hersh in 1995 for their study for Fidelity Invest ments.\nThey looked at 12 different fonts in sizes from 6 to 9.75 points.\nResults:  The most preferred fonts were Arial and MS Sans Serif at\n9.75 points.\nTwo other researchers (Bernard and Mills, 2000) evaluated 10- and\n12-point Arial and Times New Roman fonts.\nResults:  No reliable differences in reading speed or in error detec-\ntion. However, the readers said they preferred  the 12-point fonts.\nBernard didn’t stop there. He put three different font sizes (10, 12,\nand 14 points) in eight different typefaces on the c hopping block (Bernard,\net al., 2001)— four serif fonts: Century Schoolbook, Courier New, Geor-gia, and Times New Roman, and four sans serif fonts: Arial, ComicSans, Tahoma, and Verdana.\nResults:1. Subjects read Arial and Times New Roman faster than\nCourier, Schoolbook, and Georgia.\nb03 cash ch 3.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 115\nCA$HVERTISING\n1162. Subjects read the 12-point fonts faster than the 10-point\nfonts.\n3. Subjects preferred all the fonts—except Century\nSchoolbook—over Times New Roman.\nIn 2002, the Software Usability Research Laboratory published the\nresults of a study titled “A Comparison of Popular Online Fonts: WhichSize and Type is Best?”\nResults:\n1. The most legible fonts were Arial, Courier, and Verdana.2. At 10 points, participants preferred Verdana. Times New\nRoman was the least preferred.\n3. At 12 points, Arial was preferred and Times New Roman\nthe least preferred.\n4. The preferred font overall was Verdana, and Times New\nRoman was the least preferred.\nBottom line:  For easiest online reading, use Arial for 12-point text\nand larger. Smaller than 12 point? Verdana, but rarely go smaller than10 point. For a more formal look, use Georgia. For older readers, use 14point.\nCA$HVERTISING Tip:  Set long headlines in black.  Other col ors—\nyes, even red—are more difficult to read. White backgrounds are best,followed by yellow. And just as with hardcopy printing, avoid reversingtext, as discussed in Ad Agency Secret #8: The Reverse-Type Pitfall.\nAd-Agency Secret #12:\nInsist on the Pro-Design Difference\nOwning a hammer doesn’t make you a carpenter. Having a scalpel\ndoesn’t make you a doctor. And using graphic design software does not\nmake you a graphic designer. So, I beg you, don’t design your own salesmaterials. I’ve seen ads that were so amateurish they looked as thoughthey were designed by Miss Susan’s Romper Room class. Your image iscritical—especially when promoting to those who don’t know you. Manysales are won and lost simply by how you graphically represent yourself.\nCA$HVERTISING Tip:  Call some local ad agencies, ask to speak\nto the art or creative director, and say, “Hello, my name is [your namehere] and I’m hoping you could help me. I run a small business and\nb03 cash ch 3.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 116\nAd-Agency Secrets\n117I’m putting together an [ad, brochure, flyer]. Could you recommend a\ngood freelance designer?” They usually work with several, so ask for afew. Or, if you choose to find a designer online, be sure to review his orher portfolio. Ask how much he or she charges, and whether he or shebills hourly or per project. Some are expensive, some not. Many chargedepending upon how big a company they think you are. (Hint: don’tsound big.) Or, if money’s tight, call local graphic arts schools. Theycan usually recommended students who’d be thrilled to do the jobcheaply. But before spending a penny, ask for samples. Some will begreat; others will make you run away in horror.\nAd-Agency Secret #13:\nThe Power of Questions\nWhat kind of questions?  Any kind! Just look at the writing in this\nbook. You’ll see many examples of this ploy. What does it do?  (The last\nsentence is a perfect example.) It causes your prospects to desire theanswer. So what happens?  They continue reading to find out the answer.\nI love this technique. Why?  Because it works like a lure to help me cap-\nture greater readership. Use it in headlines. Use it in subheads. And ofcourse, us it in your body copy.\nAccording to neuro-linguistic programming (NLP) proponents,\nquestions create what’s called an o pen loop  in the reader’s brain. Want an\nexample?  (Note the open loop I just created.) Do you want to know one\nsimple technique that will triple your coupon response with no additional costor effort? Did you catch your own response? If you’re similar to most\nother businesspeople, you probably responded (at least internally) witha yes. Because you want to know the answer to that question, I haveeffectively “installed” an open loop in your brain.\nThe hypothesis is that once the open loop is installed, the brain will\ncontinue to search for information in order to close the loop. And al-though I’ve seen no scientific research to support that claim, questionsare a powerful way to keep people reading. I know a business trainer\nwho uses this technique. Instead of just rambling, he continually in-serts questions into his talks. Every question grabs his audience’s atten-tion and challenges them to answer it. Asking questions keeps everyonealert because it acts like mini “pop quizzes that help keep listeners ontheir toes.”\nb03 cash ch 3.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 117\nCA$HVERTISING\n118So now that I’ve revealed this little ploy, be alert to how I use it in\nthis book, okay? Notice how it affects you and how it turns what wouldotherwise be a monologue into something that feels more like a two-wayconversation.\nAd-Agency Secret #14:\nThe     “Granny Rule” of Direct Mail\nLet’s say you’re face-to-face with a salesman named Larry. Larry\nsells seafood. (And he smells like it too.) Today Larry would like to sellyou lobsters, and he thinks you’ll be a darn good prospect.\nFirst, Larry will try to establish rapport with you. According to the\nAmerican Heritage Dictionary, rapport is “a relationship of mutual trustor emotional affinity.” In other words, Larry wants you to like him. Thatway, you’ll be more likely to buy his big ol’ lobsters.\nTo influence you to like him, Larry will “meet you in your world” by\ntalking about things to which you can relate. If you like cars, he’ll talkabout the gorgeous new Lexus LF-A Roadster. If you like Mexican food,he’ll tell you about Las Palomas, a cozy little restaurant on the water-front in Puerto Vallarta that makes killer margaritas the size of yourhead. If you like dogs, he’ll show you a picture of his adorable flat-coated retriever, Joey. If Larry does everything right, you’ll begin tothink that Larry is a lot like you. Larry, therefore, has succeeded inestablishing rapport. You’re now more likely to accept what he says, andbuy what he sells. (Sound familiar? It’s Consumer Psychology Principle#10—the Cialdini Liking  cue.)\nAfter a bunch of preliminary yakking, Larry will eventually open his\nbriefcase and pull out all kinds of samples to further entice you to buyhis freshly caught—and still snappin’—lobsters.\nNow, let’s make an analogy. Sales letters  are like Larry’s words. They’re\npersonal, one-on-one, and try to “meet you in your world.” Brochures ,\nby contrast, are like Larry’s briefcase: impersonal, and filled with samples,photos, and complete details. Each component works in a different wayfor the same end result: the sale.\nRemember:  Advertising is a salesperson in print, a salesperson\nbroadcasted to the masses.\nYour sales letter is your salesperson. Think of it that way! It should\nbe personal. A good salesperson wouldn’t greet you by saying, “Hello,Occupant...,” and neither should your sales letter. It should meet your\nb03 cash ch 3.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 118\nAd-Agency Secrets\n119prospects in their world.

Don’t just say, “Y eah, yeah. I don’t feel like writing them down—I know what the benefits are in my head.” Do it! And remember: Writeonly the benefits, not the features. (Refer to Ad Agency Secret #2: Bom-bard Your Readers with Benefits for a quick refresher.) After you’ve com-pleted your list, rank them in order of importance—to your customer ,\nnot to you. That is, list the benefit you feel is the strongest selling pointas #1, and so on, down the list. When you’re done, you’ll have a list ofthe key selling points of your product.\nNow take the #1 benefit and work that benefit into the opening  of\nyour letter.\nb03 cash ch 3.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 119\nCA$HVERTISING\n120CA$HVERTISING Tip:  It’s always a good idea to work the idea of\nease and quickness into your first sentence.

You’d slam the door in myface if I came to your house with that “powerful” opener.\nCA$HVERTISING Tip:  Start your letter with a question.

You need to somehow make your enve-lope stand out from the others.\nDo you know how to tease?\nThe message on your outside envelope (called the “OSE” or “car-\nrier” in agency circles) is referred to as the “teaser.” The teaser can ei-ther give information about your offer or be totally non-content-specific.In my opinion, you should rarely use informational teasers on yourOSE unless your product is pin-point targeted to your mailing list—and hopefully it is. Why? Because teasers immediately tell the recipientthat the envelope contains a sales pitch. I’d much rather use nonspe-cific teasers such as, “PERSONAL ATTENTION OF:,” “PERSONALLETTER FOR:,” or “IMPORTANT LETTER FOR:” typed above theaddressee’s name and address, if anything at all.\nTry these tips\nTry brightly colored envelopes. Rubberstamp or print the word,\n“URGENT” in bloodred ink. Use lots of stamps of smaller denomina-tions on the front, rather than just one stamp. And here’s a great trick I\nb03 cash ch 3.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 121\nCA$HVERTISING\n122use after fulfilling an information request from someone who called me\non the phone: Write a personal message on the front of the envelope,next to their typewritten name and address, such as: “Eileen: Here’sthe Information We Talked About! —Drew.”\nBut what if you’ve had no phone contact, you’re mailing to a non-\nspecific audience, and they haven’t even requested what you’re send-ing? Well, how about, “Mirko: Please Read This Letter Before 9:30Tonight! —Drew.” (Then justify the 9:30 deadline in the letter some-how, as in, it’s an ordering deadline or the like.) Or “Cyndi: Please TellMe if I’m Wrong About You —Drew.” The variations are endless.\nThese personal teasers work best with a personal-looking OSE,\nsomething that looks as though an individual—not a corporation—created it either by hand, or with one’s personal ink-jet printer.\nAnd now, back to our story...\nAfter opening your envelope, the folks at the FDA will next pull out\nyour letter. If you didn’t know that your #1 job of each of your compo-\nnents (OSE, letter, brochure, and so on) is to first get attention, youmight destroy your letter’s effectiveness by grinding out some boringnonsense that sounds as though you’re applying for a job:\nDear Mr. Manstreth:\nFor the past 23 years I have worked for some of the most\nforward-thinking medical labs in the country.

In all that time, I dreamed ofone day being able to write you this letter. Under the enor-mous funding of blah, blah, blah...\nY awn! What’s this guy’s problem? He discovered the cure for cancer\nand he’s boring his reader with the energy-sapping details of his careerpath?

Of course, I realize that your\nproduct or service probably doesn’t carry the same weight as the curefor cancer (no matter how good your return policy), so let’s look atsome others, shall we?\nStart your sales letters this way\nLet’s say you sell a tear gas spray to women. The opening of your\nletter should not be:\nDear Janet,\nIn these days of uncertainty on our streets, we continu-\nally read about the horrors that women face. We readfrightening statistics that paint a gloomy picture of blahblah blah...\nInstead, write:\nDear Janet,\nCan you protect yourself against a 220-pound rapist?\nWhich grabbed your attention? The answer’s obvious!\nNow, let’s say you sell DVDs that teach people how to be more self-\nconfident. Don’t write:\nDear Eric,\nRecent advances in brain-mind technology are so excit ing!\nBy simply playing a DVD, you can build self-confidence,boost self-esteem, blah blah blah...\nInstead, write:\nDear Eric,\nWould you like to DOUBLE, TRIPLE, even QUADRUPLE your\nself-confidence?

Read on...\nQuestion:  If you wanted to be more self-confident, which letter open-\ning would grab your attention? Again, it’s obvious. So why don’t more\npeople write their advertising copy this way? Because they’re too timid.They’re afraid of offending people. They’re more concerned with mak-ing their copy sound pretty, elegant, and graceful. Personally, I don’tgive a damn how graceful my copy sounds. I’m writing for response.\nFact:  People aren’t waiting for your offer to arrive, so there’s no time\nfor tippy toeing. You need to make a big impact fast!\nThe Granny Rule says that to grab people’s attention with your\ndirect mail, it helps to make your mailing like something your deargranny would send you. Imagine her, so sweet, covered with her multi-colored, patchwork, hand-crocheted shawl, getting out a plain, white\nenvelope. She grabs an ordinary blue ball point pen. And she handwrites\nyour name and address. Then she grabs a piece of simple white  paper\nand handwrites a letter to you, calling you by name , and writing the way\ngrandmothers do: conversationally, warmly, with real concern for yourwell being (along with a precisely metered induction of guilt so you visitmore often). She then licks the envelope, affixes a real live postage stamp ,\nand mails it.\nThe fact is, the things Granny does are actually some of the most\neffective things any business can do when preparing a direct mailing—not slick; not expensive. But simple and personal. And you know what?Granny gets every one of her letters opened. Why? Because they lookpersonal!  About  99 percent of the mailings today look exactly like what\nthey are: solicitations . They look as though they’re screaming, “Hey\nDumbo! Open this envelope fast! We’re a big company that hired anexpensive ad agency to create this mailing to shoe-horn open your wal-let in 60 seconds flat!”\nWhat a waste. Unless your mailing is so well-targeted (being mailed\nto people who have proven to, or are very likely to, be interested in theexact type of product or service you’re selling), your  slick package will\nmost likely end up in the trash.\nFor example, I know that if I want to make money selling a weight-\ngain product to body builders, I’d look for a mailing list of bodybuild-ers who have purchased online or via mail order, and have boughtrecently, and frequently, and spent a lot of money. Anytime you buy a\nb03 cash ch 3.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 124\nAd-Agency Secrets\n125mailing list, the most important factors, after finding names that are\nlikely to respond to your type of offer, are:\n1. Recency of purchase (the more recent the better).2. Frequency of purchase (the more times they bought your\ntype of product the better).\n3. High Dollar Amount Spent  (this shows greater\ncommitment than someone who spent just $2.50).\nFor example, if you can get a hotline list (folks who purchased very\nrecently) of people who have bought similar products and have spentbig bucks to do so, and have bought a number of times, then you have a\npotentially super list for your product.\nPlease don’t use mailing labels to address your OSEs. It screams\n“MASS MAILING HERE!” Either buy a printer that lets you feed astack of envelopes, or let a good letter shop spray the names in a realis-tic handwriting font. Or give the whole project to a senior citizens groupand pay them to hand-address the envelopes. For just a few bucks you’llhave the most appealing form of addressing. (Plus, you would havegiven a group of nice people an interesting job to do.) Handwritinggrabs attention. They’re the OSEs people usually tear into first. Why?Because they look like a personal letter from a dear old friend.\nFor the sales letter? Choose a nice, readable font. I used to swear by\nCourier because it looks so personal, and I still use it at times. But thedefinition of a “personal-looking” font is changing, with everyone nowusing serif fonts such as Times, Schoolbook, Bookman, and Palatino.\nFor the response device  (what we ad-folk call the order form), a grand-\nmotherly thing to do would be to never call it an “Order Form,” but a“Personal Trial Certificate.” Or “Personal, No-Obligation Trial Certifi-cate.” And if you can have your recipient’s name and address alreadyon this form, so much the better. Print it on a nice canary (yellow) paperso it stands out from the other pieces in the mailing. Always restate theoffer on this piece. And use the big word “YES!” to the right of a squarebox with a bold check mark in it connoting approval.\nMaster John Caples advises to always show (on the form) a small\npicture of what people get when they reply. For example, if it’s an orderform for a book, show the book. Play up your guarantee too. Put your\nmailing address, phone number, and e-mail and Web addresses on thebottom of this form in case they lose the rest of your mailing. In fact,your name and address should appear on all of your components.\nb03 cash ch 3.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 125\nCA$HVERTISING\n126And remember the scarcity  factor. Be sure you stress how urgent it is\nto return the form without delay. If you have a deadline to respond,great! Make sure it not only appears in your letter, brochure, and othermaterials, but also on your response device to give them an extra prod.Remember, without a deadline, people are inclined to just “think about it.”\nAnd lastly, include a BRE (business reply envelope) to take the last\nobstacle out of the responding process, should they choose not to orderonline. Hey, do you want to lose a sale because your prospect couldn’tfind a stamp, or was too lazy to address an envelope? You can evensmack a real “live” stamp on a reply envelope if you don’t have or wishto get a business reply permit. And because people all want ultra-fastservice, use a little psychology by printing or rubberstamping in red,“RUSH! ORDER ENCLOSED!” or “24-HOUR PROCESSING” orsome similar wording to give the reply envelope a more active, impor-tant look.\nNow, go forth into the direct mail world like dear ol’ Granny and, er,\nkick ass!\nAd-Agency Secret #15:\nThe Psychology of “Social Proof”\nIt doesn’t matter if you sell to doctors or pizzeria owners; people\nbelieve testimonials. They have since the very first one was used in 1926by Ponds, the cold-cream company. And if you’re  not using them, you’re\nnot just missing the boat, but the 220,000-ton Royal Caribbean Oasis of\nthe Seas —the largest cruse ship on planet Earth!\nHow do you get them? Ask! Simply write a letter (or e-mail) to your\ncustomers and say, “We want to make you famous!” Then tell them youwant their honest opinions about your product or service. Explain thatyou’re putting together a new ad, brochure, Website, what have you,and you’d like to use their testimonial along with, if they’d like, theirphoto. In exchange for this, most folks will be happy with a few copiesof the finished piece to show friends and family.\nFor example, let’s say you’re a Website designer. You might ask ques-\ntions such as, “What do you think about our design services? Whatkind of response are you getting from your new site? How do our ser-vices compare with other designers you’ve used? What do you like bestabout the way we do business? Are our prices reasonable? Would yourecommend us to a friend? Would you hire us again?”\nb03 cash ch 3.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 126\nAd-Agency Secrets\n127Then, under the questions, I put a legal disclaimer that says, “I give\nFlaming Radish Web Design permission to use my quotes above, incomplete or edited form, [ ] with/[ ] without my name and city/state(your address/phone number will not be used) for advertising/publicitypurposes. As full compensation, Flaming Radish will provide me with10 copies of the first printed piece in which my testimonial appears.”\nSimply provide a signature and date line, and that’s it! It’s so easy, it\nboggles my brain why more businesses aren’t using testimonials. Re-member to send the copies of the printed piece. These copies are whatthe law calls “consideration,” which essentially binds the agreement.Or, if you’d prefer, send your request with $1.00. Say, “We’re enclosing$1.00 to help cover any expenses you have in returning this form tous.” In this case, the $1.00 becomes the consideration. And don’t allowthem to incur any expense in returning the form to you. You pay the\nreturn postage by means of a self-addressed stamped envelope (SASE).\nRemember: If you want people to respond to your offer, you have\nto make it as easy as possible for them!  Don’t you be the lazy one!\nAd-Agency Secret #16:\nThe Guillotine Principle\nI call this the “Guillotine Technique,” and it’s a proven eyeball-grabber.\nIt’s based on the notion that a head or face is the best attention-getter.Simply put a photo of someone’s head in your ad. The face/head shouldbe looking directly at the reader. Smiling is generally preferable, but ofcourse this depends upon what type of product or service you’re offer-ing. The screaming, distorted face of a 235-pound mugger would be areal shocker in an ad for tear gas.\nAre you a carpenter? Put a close-up of your face somewhere in your\nad! A  dentist? Show your face! Not only does a face attract immediate\nattention, but it gives your ad a warmer, more personal feel. Nothingfancy is needed. Even a tiny black-and-white photo will do.\nThe byproduct of all this is added trust, because now you’re more\nthan just a nameless (and faceless!) business; you’re a real person. Inaddition, the constant repetition of your photo can make you famous.Include your face and name in all your ads, and you’ll soon become ahousehold word. (And possibly get stopped on the street every now andthen: “Hey, aren’t you...?”)\nb03 cash ch 3.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 127\nCA$HVERTISING\n128CA$HVERTISING Tip:  Put your photo at the top of your ad and\nmake your headline a quote from you. For example, next to my photo inmy ad, the headline reads (quote marks included), “Give Me 90 Min-utes & I’ll Show You How to Double...Triple...Quadruple Your Ad Re-sponse!” You can’t help but notice it. So give the “guillotine” a go!\nAd-Agency Secret #17: PVAs—The Easy Way\nto Boost the Power of Your Copy\nQuestion:  Which of the following sentences conveys more excite-\nment and interest to you?\n1.

Why not do it aggres-\nsively? Why not do more than your competition is doing? You’renot the only one in this business, you know.\nGeorge: Uh huh.\nDrew: These soaps are great! But you need to do more than your\ncompetition. You need to stand out!\nGeorge: Well, if what you’re saying is so great, why doesn’t anyone else\ndo it?\nDrew: Simple. Because most people don’t do things the best pos-\nsible way. They do what they think  is best. And since most\nbusinesspeople don’t know much about creating effective ad-vertising, they don’t do what could be most effective!\nGeorge: [Thinking. It sounds like a field of crickets.]\nDrew: You’re selling specialty soaps. Not Ivory, Zest, or Irish Spring.\nYou’re selling expensive  soap that has two things going for it:\n(1) It looks beautiful, and (2) it smells  delicious. Not playing\nup the two things that make your soap so appealing is a giantmistake! People don’t buy your soap because they simply needto get clean. They can get clean with a cheap bar of Ivory.\nGeorge: Y es...but people will know how it smells when they buy it . Plus,\neveryone knows what oranges, coconuts, and lemons smelllike. They smell like oranges, coconuts, and lemons.\nDrew: [To self.]Dear God, help me.\nGeorge: ...so why take all that space to describe it to people who al-\nready know?\nDrew: Because it helps persuade! Look at it this way: if someone\nsees your brochure, and that someone likes the smell of or-anges, then she is going to be romanced by a description that’sin keeping with what she likes. (Read that again.) It helps herimagine! It takes up more “space” in her brain by creating amental movie of the product!

Because they’re the only ones telling the whole story, which auto-matically gives the impression that the others don’t do these things. It’sa devilishly potent psychological tool that sends the competition scram-bling because they’ll quickly realize the disadvantage you’ve thrust uponthem.\nAd-Agency Secret #18:\nDirecting      Mental Movies\nAnswer these questions honestly:\n1.

Ooooh,look how all the sweet cherry juice flows out every timeyour fork sinks into that nice, thick slice. Y eah...put a littlewhipped cream on it, will ya? Wow...did you ever see somuch fruit?!\n2. Would you be more repulsed by having to kill a few bugs, or\nhaving to destroy an active nest of angry black widow spi-ders, including a quivering web of their just-hatched-hoteggs, guarded by their mindless, poison-fanged mother?Don’t forget that just one female black widow can blow out\nfour to nine egg sacs every summer, each containing up to\n750 eggs incubating a fresh new load of up to 750spiderlings in just 14 to 30 days. Worse still, each venom-ous arachnid lives—no, mates and breeds!—inside yourhome with your children and pets, for up to three full years!\nTry killing them yourself if you must, but think about\nthis: If you miss killing just one egg-engorged female (orone of her hundreds of nearly microscopic crawling ba-bies), you’ll suffer a full-blown arachnid infestation in notime!

My careful word selection made plain old pie\nfar more appealing. And—ugh—that “little” spider problem (that youotherwise would have handled yourself) now turns into a worthwhile$89 call to the exterminator. So what’s happening here?\nFirst, realize that all experience is made up of only these five\nfactors—V-A-K-O-G:\n1. Visual (sight).\n2. Auditory (sound).3. Kinesthetic (feeling or emotions).\n4. Olfactory (smell).\n5. Gustatory (taste).These elements—our senses—are the ingredients of experience. Any\ntime we experience anything in life, a blend of these elements is alwayspresent. We call these elements “IRs”—internal representations—because they represent our experience of the world around us inter nally,\nin our heads. In fact, memory is just a blend of these elements. When-ever you recall any experience, whether it’s the pizza you ate yesterday,or the roller coaster you screamed on 28 years ago, you’re accessing ablend of these five elements; a set pattern that “equals” your experience.\nTo boost the effect of your words—no matter what kind of advertis-\ning you’re writing, be it ads, brochures, sales letters, flyers, e-mails,Websites, billboards, or radio or TV commercials—what you need to dois increase the strength of the representations in your prospects’ brains.You need to ramp up the intensity of the five elements so that youcreate a concentrated  internal experience with sufficient power to affect\nhis or her behavior. This, my friend, is the secret recipe for getting peopleto take action.\nLet’s fact it: Your prospects are busy living their lives. They don’t\ncare about you or your product, but only how your product or servicecan make their lives better. In most cases, for most products and ser-vices (there are exceptions), you yourself mean absolutely nothing tothem. (Gasp!)\n“Drew! That’s so cynical! How can you say something so horrible?”\nRelax . It’s just a way of looking at the whole process. It goes back to the\nold maxim, “People don’t buy your product for its features; they buy itfor its benefits.” So the way we get people to act, to buy, to ask for more\nb03 cash ch 3.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 133\nCA$HVERTISING\n134information, is to take what’s otherwise a dull, fuzzy image in their brains,\nand turn it into a sharp, super-focused, loud, colorful, tasty, fragrant,highly sensory experience.\nOwn a karate school? Don’t just tell parents that you’ll teach their\nkids to be more confident and get better grades. Every  school says that!\nAlso say that their kids will never become a punching bag for theschoolyard bully, with his dirty face, foul mouth, and clenched fists.(Feel the difference?)\n“But Drew, no one writes copy like that! A karate school typically\nsays, “We teach your child self-confidence and discipline, and give afree uniform when you enroll.’ They don’t say any of that ‘dirty face,foul mouth’ stuff!”\nThat’s because (1) they don’t think to write this way, and/or (2) they’re\nafraid to write this way for fear of what people might think, or (3) they’reduplicating everyone else’s mediocre ads. It’s a form of “business in-breeding,” and the end result is weak, mutant advertising that meansnothing to anybody.\nStop being afraid to use your own brain. Forge your own path and\nleave your own mark. You don’t need permission from anybody to do\nthings your way. You be the leader. You be the one people copy becausewhat you’re doing is so unique. Shake people up in your industry. Whybe just another person in your industry who does nothing new, nothingworth noting, nothing that gets people talking and buying?\nOkay, did you see what we did in that spider example? We simply\nenlarged, or heightened the IRs, the internal representations  in our reader.\nWe metaphorically grabbed our reader by the arms and shook him up.With our clear (visual) and nauseating (kinesthetic) description, We nowoccupy far more space in his brain. And by doing so we have effectivelyactivated more brain cells by causing him to think more deeply (centralroute processing, remember?) about his (now repulsive) spider ordeal.And whenever you occupy more of people’s brains, you’re far morelikely to persuade them. More likely to get them to act. We took fuzzyimages (those with little color and detail) and sharpened them to crys-tal clarity.\nThis is why long copy consistently outsells short copy. It’s why a\nsalesperson who spends two hours with you will typically outsell a sales-person who spends five minutes. More time and more words lead tomore persuasion.\nb03 cash ch 3.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 134\nAd-Agency Secrets\n135What do you sell? How can you “beef up” your descriptions?

After all, Itold you what it does, how to hook it up, what it costs, that it’s effective,and that it comes with a two-year warranty! What the heck more do youneed to know? Seems to me you have everything you need to make abuying decision. I even gave you my testimonial! The fact is, you didnot buy because you were not sold. You’re not buying because you havenot amassed sufficient internal representations to spend money. Youhave facts, yes, but facts alone create few IRs. Facts alone do not primethe brain to buy.\nSo what do I need to say to motivate you to buy this product? I\nsimply need to create visual IRs, auditory (sound) IRs, kinesthetic (feel-ings or emotion) IRs,  olfactory (smell) IRs, and maybe even gustatory(taste) IRs—as many as practical—and tour you through the use of theproduct. My goal is to make my words so clear that you actually demon-strate the product in your mind before you buy it. For example:\nDear Scott,\nOh my God, this new pool cleaner I just installed is amaz-\ning! You HAVE to buy one for your own pool! It’s by farthe easiest pool cleaner I’ve ever used, and believe me, Idid my research.\nIt’s a long, ribbed plastic hose that attaches to your\nvacuum line or skimmer. It looks like a blue manta ray(about 2 feet long), and it skims gracefully across thebottom of the pool. It almost looks alive, so I named it“Squidly Diddly.” :-)\nAnyway, Squidly climbs the walls, and sucks all the leaves,\nsand, and other nasty stuff through its tiny mouth andconveniently deposits it into your filter basket for quickremoval.\nb03 cash ch 3.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 135\nCA$HVERTISING\n136He even comes with a video that helps you put it together\nin less than 10 minutes. It’s so easy my retriever Giuseppecould do it!\nThe company is well-known in the industry and has sold\nmore than 1,250,000 of these cleaners worldwide. I dida ton of research before buying it, and all the reviewsare favorable, far better than other pool cleaners in thisprice range. Price? It was only $250 and comes with atwo-year warranty, and a $50 rebate!\nI had one question and got someone on the phone\nfast...she was really friendly and helpful.\n(Ha! While I was typing this, my wife came into the house\nand told me that the pool filter was LOADED with the junkthat Squidly slurped out. This thing really works like crazy!)\n[NOTE FROM DREW: The paragraph above is part of the sell\ncopy. It’s worded to “step out of ” the context of an ad and con-\nvey a sense of “here and now ,” or real-time authenticity, as I\ndiscussed at the start of this chapter.]\nSquidly makes a funny chuga-chuga-chuga sound when\nhe’s doing his job, but he’s pretty darn quiet. He works sowell we had to put a bucket near the filter so we had amore convenient place to dump all the junk he sucks outof our pool. (Remember how brown and muddy-lookingour pool was last week? You should see the water now...itsparkles like a Caribbean lagoon, and I swear it evensmells better too!)\nForget hand-vacuuming your pool! With my pal Squidly\nall I do is relax and sip pi\nña coladas while he cleans the\npool for me, day and night. He never misses a day, nevercomplains, and never raises his prices. (Oh, by the way,I’m going to lay off Frank, the pool cleaner, next week.He’s really a nice guy, but this automatic cleaner will saveme $850 a year!)\nThe lesson is simple: Unless you create sufficient internal representa-\ntions in your prospects’ brains, you will insufficiently move them to\nmentally create their own IRs that ultimately cause them to pull out\ntheir wallets and buy what you’re selling.\nb03 cash ch 3.pmd 10/3/2008, 1:25 PM 136\nAd-Agency Secrets\n137Of course, you won’t always be able to use all five modes of internal\nrepresentations. If you’re a printer, for example, you’re not going to tellpeople how wonderfully fruity your red and orange inks tastes (gusta-tory). But you could talk about how quality papers, glossy and smoothor rich with cottony texture (kinesthetic), can make their stationery somuch more visually appealing, and how people will actually feel (kines-thetic) the quality when they hold their letters and brochures. This, inturn, translates into an unconscious association of quality with yourcompany, and your products and services as well.\nIt’s like jump-starting a car battery: Unless you apply enough juice,\nthe car won’t start. It’s the same with the mental movies you install inyour prospects’ brains: Unless you create a “movie trailer” that’s engag-ing enough to cause them to think more about what you’re saying, they’llsimply turn the page or click away to another site.\nAd-Agency Secret #19:\nBattling Human Inertia\nI often begin my seminars in character: an old, stodgy salesman. I\nplant myself in a chair in front of my audience and drone on, in mymost unenthusiastic voice, the most unmoving, uninspiring, uncon-vincing and un- everything  sales pitch you could imagine. “No need to\nrush into the buying decision,” I say. “Most likely dozens of other compa-nies sell the same product at the same price, and offer you the same ser-vice. There’s plenty of time; the product will be here when you need it.”\nUgh! I then leap from my chair and shout, “If the old expression is\ntrue that advertising is nothing more than a salesperson in print, thenTHAT (pointing back to the chair I sprang from), I assert to you, is thetypical salesperson that the average business has out there on the streetrepresenting them today!”\nThe point? No matter how slick a salesperson, no matter how beau-\ntiful an ad, if they don’t cause people to take action , they’re both a lousy\ninvestment. An ad that only informs  and doesn’t move people to buy is\nlike a salesperson who can’t close. Fire the salesperson. Trash the ad.They’re wasting both your money and time.\nb03 cash ch 3.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 137\nCA$HVERTISING\n138The simplest definition of advertising, and one that will\nprobably meet the test of critical examination, is that\nadvertising is selling in print.\n—Daniel Starch\nGetting action requires two steps: (1) Make it easy to act, and then\n(2) ask for action.\nDisclaimer:  These ingredients do not guarantee  people will act. If\nthat were the case, then every ad you place that conformed to these twosteps would be a smashing success. However, you will significantly raise\nthe chances  of your success. That would be okay, wouldn’t it? So let’s\ntalk about Step 1: Make it easy to act.\nAs Joan Rivers says, “Can we talk?” We humans are lazy creatures. If\nwe could push a button for almost everything that’s now buttonless,we’d do it. Push-button shower? Push-button drive to work? Push-button push-button! In fact, there are few things left anymore that donot offer push-button convenience. We want to be satisfied now. We\nwant results yesterday .\nThis means that people are hypersensitive to things that appear to\nbe troublesome. We resist “getting involved.”\nFor example, at the scene of a car accident a driver asks a bystander\nto be a witness. He replies, “Oh, I’d rather not get involved.” The by-stander is running a movie in his head filled with unpleasant scenes ofall kinds of hassles, ordeals, and bothersome tasks requiring an un-known expenditure of energy. So he turns and walks away. And becausepeople are hypersensitive to exerting themselves, and they do whateverthey can to avoid effort, as advertisers it would be wise for us to makebuying as easy as possible.\nFor example, did you ever get a direct-mail solicitation with an order\nform that’s already filled in with your name and address? It requiresyou to do nothing more than add your credit card number or a check,and slip it into a postage-paid envelope that’s also personalized withyour return address. Today’s digital printing makes this easy and cost-effective. There’s also a toll-free phone number. Maybe they even letyou pay C.O.D. because they know if they do most of the work for you,\nthey’re removing roadblocks that might prevent you from ordering.They’re greasing the slide, so to speak, and looking for an unconscious“Gee, look how easy!” response.\nb03 cash ch 3.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 138\nAd-Agency Secrets\n139Accept as many alternate forms of payment as possible: all the ma-\njor credit cards, personal checks, money orders, and PayPal. You shouldoffer several shipping options, from regular ground to overnight ex-press (you could lose business if you don’t ship fast enough). Gift-wrapping saves your customers time and effort on birthdays and\nholidays. Offer a strong guarantee to quell their fear of loss. Offer apayment plan—“Just $14.99 a month for three months”—to reducethe psychological pain of spending money. Offer Web ordering, espe-cially when your competition doesn’t. Tell your prospects exactly how to\norder, step by step. If you’re a retailer, always provide your address,phone, and concise driving directions (not everyone uses a GPS) andyour daily hours. Say, “It’s Easy To Order!” And use variations of it thatare suitable for your type of business: “It’s Easy to Get a FREE Esti mate!”\nor “It’s Easy to Schedule Your Home Inspection!” or “It’s Easy to GetBusiness Cards Printed for 50 percent Off!” or “It’s Easy to Steam CleanYour Own Carpets & Save $199!” and an endless stream of variations.People want more ease in their lives. Tell them how easy it is to buy from\nyou.\nAd-Agency Secret #20: Establish\nYour Unique Selling Proposition\nIf you’ve attended my seminars, you know that I’m adamant about\nusing some type of gimmick or USP—unique selling proposition—todifferentiate yourself in the market. You don’t want to be like a 5-poundbag of sugar or salt in the grocery store, do you? Few people are fussyabout what brand of sugar or salt they buy. To them, sugar is sugar. Saltis salt. In fact, ask a friend, “What’s your favorite brand of salt?” He’lllook at you like you’re nuts.\nThe truth is, most people don’t care much about these commodity\nproducts. They don’t stand out. They blend in with other brands. Theresult? They are not preferred.\nFact:  When people can’t distinguish you from your competition,\nthey have no reason to prefer  you. And your goal in business is to have\npeople prefer  your product, to choose you over everyone else offering\nthe same or a similar thing.\nI grew up in northeast Philadelphia. About a mile from my home\nwas (and still is) a little ’50s-style diner called Nifty Fifty’s at the busycorner of Grant Avenue and Blue Grass Road. This place does an in-credible job of differentiating itself from its competitors—the lunch and\nb03 cash ch 3.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 139\nCA$HVERTISING\n140dinner lines busting through their doors onto the sidewalk prove it. It’s\nlocated in a shopping center built about 30 years ago. In its exact loca-tion was a dance studio, a woman’s fitness center, a Mexican food joint,a video rental store, and I don’t recall what else. But it’s the only busi-\nness that has succeeded—and in a major way—and has now expandedto five locations. No wonder: The place just does everything right. Infact, check out the awards page on the Website at www.niftyfiftys.com —\nit’s phenomenal. And this is the whole point: the proprietors  don’t keep\ntheir greatness to themselves.\nDon’t try to be amusing. Spending money\nis a serious matter.\n—Claude Hopkins\nOn the contrary. They take every opportunity to make sure you know\nhow wonderful they are, by making sure you know that they never  use\nfrozen beef, that their hamburger beef is ground fresh daily, that theirFrench fries are fresh-cut and homemade, that they never use frozenonion rings. In fact, as soon as you walk through the front door, you canlook through a big glass window into the kitchen and see the man wear-ing the paper hat dipping the big, juicy-sweet onion slices into theirhomemade batter and then into their wonderful, herb-seasoned bread-ing. They tell you what kind of oil they fry in. They tell you why it’s toyour advantage to eat there rather than Burger Slop down the block.\nThey don’t just leave it up to you and hope you discover these things,like 99.9 percent of other businesses do. They’re proactive.  They toot\ntheir own horn. They tell you why they’re great.\nThink! What interesting story can you tell people about your prod-\nuct or service? How can you educate them?\nCA$HVERTISING Tip:  Be sure your product or service is one of\nexcellent quality, or you may educate your potential buyer away from you!\n✸Don’t be just a hardware store...be “The Hardware\nSuperstore!”\n✸Don’t be just an office cleaner...be “The Office Cleaning\nTechnicians!”\n✸Don’t be just a small pet shop...be “A World of Pets\nUnder One Small Roof!”\nb03 cash ch 3.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 140\nAd-Agency Secrets\n141✸Don’t be just a graphic designer who lives in Denver...be\n“Denver’s #1 Graphic Design Persuader!”\n✸Don’t be just an ice-cream shop...be “The Home of\nMonster Dip!”\n✸Don’t be just a real estate sales office...be the “Experts of\nthe RapidSell System!”\nIf you don’t have a “RapidSell System,” then get creative and put\ntogether a program that you can call the RapidSell System. Sometimes\ndeveloping your USP requires that you do things differently, not just\ndevelop a hot tag line. Just saying  you’re an expert doesn’t make you\none. Your positioning should reflect what’s true about you. And if youthink up a great USP but it’s not quite who you are, then make it who\nyou are!\nFor example, if I wanted to call myself the Office Cleaning Techni-\ncians, but my staff looked like a bunch of unmotivated bums dressed insloppy street clothes, my “Cleaning Technicians” positioning wouldn’tgo very far, would it? The word would spread that my people aren’ttechnicians at all, but slovenly bums. So what would I do?\nFirst, I’d hire people who look and act the part. (Image goes only so\nfar. There comes a time when you have to perform and quality perfor-mance is the thing that gets you repeat business.) Next, I’d dress mypeople all in “hi-tech” blue or orange jumpsuits with my newly de-signed logo on their sleeves. I’d repaint my van and have a designer putmy new image on each. I’d redesign my stationery and hire a designerto create a fresh new brochure incorporating the clean, modern look I’dwant to portray. Now my “Technician” positioning has a chance to\nmake it in the marketplace. Now it’s backed up with something otherthan just an impressive tag line. What I say I am and how I’m perceived\nare now congruent. This is how you make your business fit your newpositioning.\nMy CA$HVERTISING seminar prompted a woman to stop refer-\nring to herself as just another printer, and instead start powerfully pro-moting her services as “The Business Image Maker!” And to back upher claim, she submits articles to her local newspaper and businesspublications telling readers how to get the most for their printing dol-lar. She offers free reports such as, “How to Use 10 Little-Known Print-ing Secrets to Make Your Business Look More Professional,” “How toUse the Power of Color to Make Your Business Materials Stand Out!”\nb03 cash ch 3.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 141\nCA$HVERTISING\n142and others. The reports are simply one to four pages and are a snap to\nproduce.\nShe also holds free printing clinics at libraries for local businesses\nwhere she shows samples of good printing and bad, and tells her audi-ence how to avoid making the same mistakes. She tells them how to getthe most bang for the buck. She explains how to save thousands byknowing the latest digital printing technology and more. They love her,and in return they give her their business. Her image helps her by posi-tioning her—and not her competition—as the go-to expert they cantrust. This woman went from simply running a printing press to beinga credible expert in her local area. And so can you.\nNot only can you position your entire business, but you can also\nposition your offer. For the following examples, I’m going to use ads\nfrom the direct-marketing industry. Late-night infomercials that claimto teach you how to make gobs of cash are more prolific than tech nerdsat a PC convention. This is where great positioning is really needed foryour ads to stand out.\nFor example, which of these two headlines attracts your attention most?\nWork from Home and Turn Your E-Mail Into Big Profits!\n19-Year Old College Kid Discovers Clever Way\nto Persuade People to Send You Money Via PayPal.\nWhich did you pick? If you have the marketing and advertising\nsavvy I think you do, then you probably picked the one about the col-lege guy, because it’s what I call “specifically unique.” It puts clear—not vague—pictures in your head. And when you do this, you have astronger hold on your readers’ attention. They’re more engaged. They’rewondering, “What about  this 19-year old kid? How did he discover this\nidea?” They probably imagine what he must look like: his face, hair,clothing. Although there are thousands of “Make Money” ads, peoplehave not heard this positioning  before. It’s fresh and different.\nTip: If you want your ad to stand out from the crowd, say some-\nthing different.\nCreate ads that are different and instantly\nrecognizable. Research finds ‘something new\nand fresh’ in the headline or picture delivers\nhigher ‘Read Most’ scores.\n—Starch Research\nb03 cash ch 3.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 142\nAd-Agency Secrets\n143Other examples:\nChinese Billionaire Reveals 14 Secrets That Helped Make\nHim So Rich.\nWith Just Four Months Left to Live, Millionaire Agrees to\nReveal His Secrets of Wealth & Success.\nMillionaire’s Private Diary Found in Palm Springs—\nReveals Little-Known Secrets of Success.\nGet it? The point is to create a hook (or positioning) that’s different\nfrom what thousands of other advertisers are saying. Be truthful, butfind an intriguing way to say it! Stop all the “Get Rich Online” non-sense; people are tired of this vague, generic stuff. Ask yourself, “What’sunique about my offer? Am I the only one offering this plan, product,or service? What’s unique about me that I can exploit?”\nAre you a farmer with a great cash-generating idea to sell to others\nin your industry? “Idaho Farmer Says, ‘Growing $100 Bills Is as Easy asGrowing Potatoes When You Follow My Plan!’”\nDid you shave your head? “Big Bald Chris Teaches Wing Chun\nKung Fu that Might One Day Save Your Life.” Make sure you put apicture of yourself on everything and you’ll become well known veryquickly.\nAre you a big or tall man or woman? “6’5\n”, 275-Pound Man Offers the\nBIGGEST Computer Discounts in the Nation!” Have a photo of you taken\nfrom floor level to emphasize your size.

Tell your ad rep you want a Half-Page Island : In contrast\nto a typical vertical or horizontal half-page, this special size is posi-tioned so it visually takes up almost the entire page and makes it verydifficult for the newspaper to put other ads near it.\nThe result? They often set only reading matter (news) next to your\nad, which means less ad competition for you. The Half-Page Island istwo columns wide and three-quarters of a page deep, yet it commandsthe entire  page, which might—according to the principle of the Length-\nImplies-Strength heuristic discussed in Consumer Psychology Principle#17—cause readers to have greater feelings of your superiority. It’s theold “The biggest ads in the Yellow Pages  must be the better, more suc-\ncessful companies” effect.\nRemember:  You don’t need giant ads for great response. Tiny little\nads—like those repeated for years, unchanged, in magazines such asPopular Science  and Popular Mechanics —have made many advertisers rich.\nBecause of their space limitations, however, they’re best for the ol’ two-step sales process: (1) prospects inquire, and (2) you send the full info,which—we hope—causes them to buy. If you’re looking to do more of acomplete selling job, you’ll need more real estate to tell your story.The Half-Page Island gives you this, while letting your story—not your\ncompetitors’—take the spotlight.\nAd-Agency Secret #22:\nAuthority Positioning\nAre you an authority on your topic? The Cues of Life model tells us\nthat authority figures have a great deal of credibility. Therefore, the claimsthey make are widely believed. Using the mental shortcut of peripheralprocessing, they rationalize that an authority knows what he’s talkingabout. After all, he must have studied his topic for years (Length-Im-plies-Strength), people everywhere listen to him so it must be okay if Ido too (Bandwagon Effect), he’s impartial and relates only the facts,not opinions (Message Sideness, Evidence), so I can rely on what hesays.\nb03 cash ch 3.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 144\nAd-Agency Secrets\n145The fact is, you too can adopt such a position—market yourself as\nan authority in your field—and wear this same coat of influence. Let’sstart with the assumption that you already have an excellent grasp onyour subject and can talk about it with fluency, because we want todiscuss how to position  yourself as an authority, not how to develop the\nstudy habits to acquire sufficient knowledge to make the claim.\nStep 1:  Begin to regard yourself as someone who has a mountain of\nvaluable information to share with others. Simple, right? Unfortunately,low self-esteem keeps many people from taking even this first step. Ifyou don’t think your knowledge is valuable, you’re doomed before youbegin.\nStep 2:  Make what you know available to the public in as many\nforms as possible. How? First, go to a local commercial photographerand have a headshot taken of yourself wearing attire that’s appropriatefor your business. Then—and this is no time to be shy—begin printingit on all your sales materials. From brochures to contracts, get your face\nin front of the public. Put it in ads, e-mails, Web pages, sales letters,billboards! Then do a little self-publishing. Start an e-zine. Create sev-eral three- to 10-page reports on your subject in both hardcopy andPDF formats.\nFor example, let’s say you’re a printer. How about creating some\nsimple reports entitled:\nHow to Get Beautiful Wedding Invitations Printed with-\nout Getting Ripped Off\nHow [YOUR CITY] Businesses Can Save Up to 27% on\nBeautiful 4-Color Printing\nHow to Make Your Resume 325% More Attention-\nGetting Than Your Competition\nSee what I mean? The report consists of information that you as a\nprinter already  know. In the resume example, your report can simply\ntalk about things such as using special papers, typestyles, foils, andinks in order to make a super-professional impression and stand out inthe crowd.\nThe reports would feature your headshot right on the cover, with\nyour name in a caption under the photo, and your business name onthe cover.

You advertise them in your ads.\nYou offer them free to anyone who comes into your shop. Not only dothey promote you as an authority, but they also make people comfort-able with you. And while 99 percent of your competition is doing abso-lutely nothing to raise their image to the public, you are positioningyourself as an authority. Remember to include a coupon with the re-port. If you did a good job, by the time they finish it, they should beprimed to do business with you because you’re now regarded as someonewho knows what they’re talking about on the topic of resume printing!\nHow else can you promote yourself as an authority?

In fact, some papers will accept your “column” for free if itoffers useful information to its readers. In any event, make sure to in-clude your business name, address, and phone number at the bottomof the ad in this sneaky way: “Have questions about how to use printingmost effectively? Send them to: [your address here].”\nGive seminars, hold workshops, create educational products, write\na book, do radio and TV interviews, blog your expertise!

What it does is capitalize on the fact\nthat (1) people love giving their opinion on things, and (2) becausethey’re already returning their survey, it’s so easy for them to slip theirpayment into the postage-paid return envelope.\nThe key is to offer something you would have offered anyway, but\nmake it available only to those people who reply to your survey. The factthat you say the low price is “your way of saying thank-you” is a greatqualifier for the low price, and gives an air of exclusivity to the offer.\nThe survey format is a snap. It’s simply a personal letter on an\n8 1/2 × 11-inch sheet of your business stationery. Mail-merge it so yourletters look personal, and not mass produced, for best response.\nYou can use this survey technique for most any product or service.\nOn top of additional sales, you’ll also get valuable feedback. In fact, thefeedback could be worth more than the profit you earn from the addi-tional sales! One great question to ask to get people to express them-selves freely is, “If you were the owner of my business, what would you\ndo differently?” You’ll be amazed at some of the great answers you’llget. The feedback you receive could completely alter the way you runyour business.

The results scientificallyproved how the inclusion of pictures, whether photos or illustrations,directly impact advertising response—no matter what type of productor service is being promoted. Here are the results of that study.\n✸Ads consisting of 50 percent visuals (photos, illustrations,\ngraphics elements) were noted (seen and recalled) 30percent more often than ads with no visuals.\n✸Ads consisting of 75 percent visuals are noted 50 percent\nmore often than ads with few or no visuals.\n✸In the “Read Most” category, these same ads also scored\n60 percent higher.\nb03 cash ch 3.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 149\nCA$HVERTISING\n150✸Four to nine visuals boost “Noted” scores by 30 percent\nover ads with fewer or no visuals.\n✸Ads with 10 or more visuals are 55 percent more likely to\nbe Noted than ads with fewer or no visuals.\n✸“Read Most” scores jump by 70 percent for ads with 10\nor more visuals.\n✸Showing the product attracts readers 13 percent more\noften than showing no product.\n✸Photos are the most compelling type of graphics and\nattract the greatest readership.\nThe Seven Best Types of Photos\nMultiple studies show that the following types of photos attract the\nmost attention. In a classic survey performed for the Kimberly-ClarkCorporation by the Gallup Research Bureau, called “Let 4,979,855 read-ers tell you what they read on Sunday,” 29,000 readers of 20 differentSunday newspapers in 16 cities were questioned. Gallup found thatreaders preferred the following pictures, listed in order of preference:\n1. Children and babies.2. Mothers and babies.\n3. Groups of adults.\n4. Animals.5. Sports scenes.\n6. Celebrities.\n7. Food.Parade  magazine once reported that the following pictures get the\ngreatest attention:\n1. Babies.\n2. Mothers and babies.3. Animals.\n4. Personalities.\n5. Food pictures.Why are these pictures so appealing to us? Because they tap into\nour Life-Force 8 desires. We want love, to protect and care for our fam-ily, social acceptance, the drive to win, status, and food and drink. InDouglas Adams’s The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy , the meaning of life\nb03 cash ch 3.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 150\nAd-Agency Secrets\n151is “42.”  In reality, the answer to most any “why” question you can ask\nabout human beings is “8”—the Life-Force 8. Try it and see.\nPictures are only effective in influencing\nbrand choice if there is a clear connection\nwith the brand and message.\n—Giep Franzen,  Advertising Effectiveness , 1994\nThe Power of Demonstration,\nAction, and Pseudo-Movement\nPlacing a photo of your product in your ad attracts readers 13 per-\ncent more often than not showing it. Product-in-use shots add an addi-tional 13 percent boost over product-only shots. Why?  In-use photos\nadd action, drama, interest, and demonstrate your product or serviceand engage readers’ imaginations. Ads with photos or illustrations ofpeople increase “noted” scores by nearly 25 percent over ads withoutany people or visuals.\nIn my CA$HVERTISING seminar I show examples of two ads for\npepper spray for two competing companies. Company A’s headlinereads, “MUGGER STOPPER!” and features a close-up of a woman’shand holding the product as if she were showing you the label. Y awn. Ican’t think of another product that offers so much dramatic possibility,yet this company opted to show their product doing...er, nothing at all.\nCompany B, on the other hand, was smart. Their headline, “Stop\nMuggers at the Push of a Button!” showed an illustration of a womanspraying a group of sleazy-looking attackers who surround her in a semi-circle. Each of the thugs is shown in various stages of distress: on theirknees, flat on the ground, coughing, grabbing their faces, screaming,and running away.\nNow tell me, dear reader, if you saw only the headlines and the pic-\ntures, which of these two products would you prefer to carry if you were\nin the market for pepper spray? The answer is obvious. Company Bgave you a demonstration—so to speak—of how its product works. Andeven though it’s an illustration—black-and-white at that—(a photo wouldhave been better), it still conveys a sense of the pepper spray’s effective-ness, whereas Company A’s crappy ad conveys nothing more than asense of advertising ignorance.\nb03 cash ch 3.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 151\nCA$HVERTISING\n152Always provide context for your photos.

They’re little items you attach to the top of the\nfirst page of your sales letter  that grab people’s eyes and make it nearly\nimpossible for them not to read further, such as a penny, nickel, dime,quarter, or dollar bill.\nIf I sent you a letter with a $1 bill stapled to the top, wouldn’t you be\ninterested? It’s just a dollar, but that letter would probably interest youmore than anything else that arrived in the mail that day. Here’s anexample of how you can begin your copy using this technique. Let’ssay, for example, that I sell carpet and I got my hands on a list of peoplewho just moved into the neighborhood.\nDear Scott,\nAs you can see, I have attached a crisp one-dollar bill to\nthe top of this letter.\nWhy? To make a point.I’m going to show you—right here in this letter—how to\nsave 100 of these bills (yes, $100.00) when you buy car-pet for your new home.\nOr let’s say I own a day spa and I mail to a list women within 5 miles\nof my business.\nDear Louise,\nAs you can see, I have attached a crisp one-dollar bill to\nthe top of this letter.\nWhy?

To make a point.I’m going to show you—right here in this letter—how to\nmake up to 10,000 of these bills (yes, $10,000.00) inless than three months, with the hottest new moneymakingprogram to hit the network marketing industry in decades!\nGet it? It’s a proven effective way to stir up your readers’ curiosity—\nand maybe even make them feel a little obligated to at least read yourletter. But there are many more grabbers than the lowly dollar. All kindsof things make interesting and effective eye-catchers.\nFor example, let’s say I’m a crafty wedding photographer and I’m\nable to get a hold of a mailing list of women about to get married.\nDear Louise,\nAs you can see, I have attached a HORRIBLE wedding\nphoto to the top of this letter.\nWhy have I done this? To keep YOU from making the same\ntragic mistake this poor couple did.\nYou see, Esther and Sam (the bride and groom) had no\nidea what to look for when they chose their weddingphotographer.\nThe result? A crying shame! The lighting was crummy. The\npeople look stiff. The angles are amateurish. The color isinconsistent. And even their skin-tone is blotchy. Their onebig day and all they have to show for it is a bunch ofmediocre photos.\nDo YOU know how to avoid the mistake Esther and Sam\nmade? I’ll tell you how, right here in this letter.\nYou’d continue your letter with some helpful tips and then describe\nthe advantage of your services. Include a sheet of testimonials (featur-ing your best photos, of course), and extend your money-saving offer.

I thought the argument\nwas buried decades ago. Not just rotting dead, but bone-dry dust dead.\nThe fact is, real-world (not academic) testing for nearly a century showsthere’s nothing left to debate. But some less informed people disagree.\nDirect response advertisers\nknow  that short copy\ndoesn’t sell. In split run tests, long copy invariably\noutsells short copy.\n—David Ogilvy\nIn fact, the one comment that immediately tells me someone knows\nvery little about advertising goes this way: “Oh, you better keep thecopy short! No one reads long copy. People are busier than ever thesedays. Keep it nice and short.”\nAlthough their warnings to keep it short might sound  logical, it’s\nutter nonsense! Direct response copy great Gary Halbert, an early men-tor of mine, once wrote, “Copy can never be too long, only too boring!”How true.\nb03 cash ch 3.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 154\nAd-Agency Secrets\n155Hundreds of studies and thousands  of experiments have been done.\nAnd all the giants of advertising, John Caples, Claude Hopkins, DavidOgilvy, John E. Kennedy, Eugene Schwartz, Maxwell Sackheim, WalterWeir, and all the other Copywriter Hall of Famers agree: Well-writtenlong copy outsells short copy. No qualifications. No disclaimers. It simply\ndoes.\nThe most common expression you hear about\nadvertising is that people will not read much.\nYet a vast amount of the best-paying advertising\nshows that people do read much.\n—Claude Hopkins\nThe fact is, if someone is a true prospect for your product, you\nwouldn’t believe how much well-written sales copy he or she will read.Don’t ramble with your copy, of course. Don’t write simply to fill upspace or to impress people with your vocabulary. But do write enoughto inform, build desire, convince, and motivate people to take action.The old expression, “the more you tell, the more you sell” is true... if you\ntell it right.\nThink about it: Would you be more likely to buy if you spent two\nhours with a good salesperson, or just 10 minutes? Two hours of course.Why, you’d hear every sales pitch in his repertoire, he’d hit you withevery benefit he could conjure, he’d uncover—and then push—every\none of your hot buttons, over and over again.\nThe only reason for using short copy is when\nthere isn’t much to say.\n—Maxwell Sackheim\nSo why would people think their sales materials are so different than\nthis salesperson? Of course, your ads, brochures, and sales letters can’tjudge feedback. They can’t see what’s turning the prospect on or off.That’s why they have to cover all the bases. Restate each benefit fromseveral different angles, and from several different perspectives.\nDid you ever notice how many car commercials, for example, not\nonly appeal to what you’re  going to think about your new car, but also\nb03 cash ch 3.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 155\nCA$HVERTISING\n156what others  think about it? Heads turn as the car whizzes by (Life-Force\n8: social approval; keeping up with the Joneses). And practicality: it’sso darned safe. Crash tests prove it. (Life-Force 8: survival; freedomfrom pain and danger; protection of loved ones). Notice how they ap-peal to not only your emotions, but also to logic and reason? This waythey speak to both the peripheral and central-route thinkers.\nBut that’s not all! The low price and high gas mileage ratings mean\nyou’re buying smart. You’re responsible. (Life-Force 8: social approval.)And you can save money for the more important things in life, such asyour kid’s education, or a nice vacation with your spouse.\nSee what’s happening? The more ways you justify the purchase of\nyour product, the more likely you’ll influence people to buy. So you takethem by the hand and tell the whole story. You pile on the benefits(Length-Implies-Strength), show pictures to help them see it, slatheron the testimonials (social proof), and back it up with a warranty (toquell fear). By the time you’re done, you have quite a convincing (andoften lengthy) sales piece. Keep it interesting and relevant. The moresell they’re exposed to, the stronger the influence.\nA salesman does not say, “How do you do?” speak\na few words about his product, then ask you to\nsign the order. No, he uses enough words to get\nyour emotions and reasoning power flowing\ntoward a sale.\n—Victor Schwab\nHere’s why I think most people don’t get it: They think that people\nmust read all the copy in order to buy. Nonsense! If I’m reading a long-\ncopy ad or sales letter, for example, and I’m ready to buy after readingjust the headline , I’ll pick up the phone and place my order right then\nand there. I’m not going to say, “Shoot! I really wanted this thing, butthere’s more copy to read. Oh hell...now I can’t order.” That’s ridiculous!\nSome people need long copy to be convinced; others can decide withless information. Long copy satisfies both parties. Ms. Long gets all\nher details. Mr. Short can stop reading whenever he wants to and place\nhis order. On the other hand, if I used only short copy, I don’t give\nMs. Long what she needs, and she goes away unconvinced. How silly tocreate sales materials for only one type of buyer.\nb03 cash ch 3.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 156\nAd-Agency Secrets\n157“But Drew, what about Web copy? That’s totally different, right?”\nWrong. Studies show that long copy outperforms short copy...yes, evenonline.\nUser Interface Engineering is a research, training, and consulting firm\nspecializing in Website and product usability. Here’s what they report.\n1. “Our research shows that fewer, longer pages may be the\nbest approach for users. In the trade-off between hidingcontent below the fold or spreading it across severalpages, users have greater success when the content is ona single page.”\n2. “Increasing the levels of information, similar to adding\nsections to an outline, also seemed to help users.”\n3. “Users may tell us they hate scrolling, but their actions\nshow something else. Most users readily scrolled throughpages, usually without comment.”\nMarketingExperiments.com conducted several tests to see what\nimpact copy length has on a Website’s conversion rate.\nResults:  Long copy outperformed short copy in all three of their\ntests.\nDespite internal debating about whether or not to try a long-copy\napproach, Online-Learning.com quadrupled  the length of the copy on\ntheir homepage. Doug Talbott reported, “The number of people wholeft our site after viewing only the homepage has dropped by about 5percent...we’ve also noticed that our enrollments have increased by about20 percent.”\nIf advertisers worried more about the quality  of their sales materials,\nthey wouldn’t have time to worry about this ridiculous chicken-and-eggriddle. They’d be too busy ringing up sales.\nAfter you have found your most efficient-size ad, you\nshould jam your space full of copy, no matter whether it\nis a one-inch ad or a full-page ad.\n—John Caples\nAnyone debating me on this point is ridiculous. Anyone debating\nJohn Caples and the other advertising greats I’ve quoted in this sectionis an advertising knucklehead.\nb03 cash ch 3.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 157\nCA$HVERTISING\n158Ad-Agency Secret #27: Offer Testing\nJust as you should test different headlines, it’s vitally important to\ntest different offers . Just because people don’t respond to your ad, that\ndoes not mean they don’t want what you’re selling. Your ad may nothave communicated effectively, or simply wasn’t sufficiently appealing.\nFor example, let’s say you’re Dr. McCracken, chiropractor, and your\ncurrent ad announces your grand opening. The ad seems great, but noone calls. So you rewrite your ad and you offer a free spinal evaluation.Or you offer 50 percent off their first visit. What you have done is changeyour offer. In fact, your Grand Opening wasn’t offering anybody any-thing at all, was it? You were just telling people to be happy becauseyou’re in business. No good. You need to develop different offers andfind out which works best.\nHow else could you frame your offer? How about instead of 50\npercent off the first visit, you say, “2 Visits for the Price of 1!” It’s thesame thing as 50 percent off, isn’t it? But testing has shown that “BuyOne Get One FREE” is more effective than saying 50 percent off. Free is\na powerful word.\nWhat else could you say? How about “April Special: FREE Spinal\nExams for Runners,” then try, “May Special: FREE Spinal Exams forBody Builders,” and so on. Why not try, “FREE Massage with EveryVisit!” What could such an appealing offer do for your customer base?I don’t care if you hire a massage school student  to do the work, you’d be\noffering more than Dr. Vertebrae down the road, and giving people whatthey’re looking for: more! Giving a free massage lets you make a very\nappealing offer in your ad, and can help you divert attention away fromyour competition that offers nothing extra.\nConstantly ask yourself, “How can I give my customers more, know-\ning that they’ll reward me with more business?” Isn’t this what you want\nwhen you shop? Don’t you want more for your money? Of course. What\nother offers can you make? How about a “Family Special?” Or a “Hus-band and Wife” deal? These are all different offers, different ways toposition the deal. Keep testing different offers until you find one thatdelivers results that knock your socks off.\nHow about a special rate for seniors? How about every fifth visit is\nfree? If you’re a chiropractor who adjusts children’s spines, how about,“Free Sammy the Smiling  Skeleton With Every Child’s Visit!” and put a\npicture of it in your ad. Sure, it’s creepy, but who knows? It might\nb03 cash ch 3.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 158\nAd-Agency Secrets\n159bomb...or it might take your practice in a whole new profitable direc-\ntion! That’s precisely why you test. How about a free back support padwith every first visit? Or an authoritative-sounding report, “14 ThingsYou’re Doing Right Now That Are Torturing Your Back and Spine.”\nIf your ads aren’t working, don’t throw in the towel and say “No-\nbody wants what I’m selling! Woe is me!” First try changing your head-line, because this will make or break your ad in the first few seconds.Then check your price, because you could simply be out of line withthe market. Then try a different offer.\nRemember:  What you’re trying to do is find out what appeals to\nthe marketplace. You can’t tell the marketplace what to buy from you.They will tell you what they want. If your ad doesn’t work, they are telling\nyou. If your phone doesn’t ring, they are telling you. If no one redeemsyour coupons, they are telling you. It’s up to you to find out what theywant and then give it to them. And that’s the subject of...\nAd-Agency Secret #28: Survey Power\nWhat’s the best way to find out what people want? Ask them. That’s\nexactly what salespeople started doing back in the 1930s. They ap-proached cab drivers, homemakers, businessmen, construction work-ers, retailers—whoever fit the description of the target market they wereafter—and fired the questions at them: “What do you like? What doyou dislike? What do you want? What would you prefer? How could itbe better?”\nThe responses gave manufacturers invaluable feedback for new and\nimproved products. It also gave their ad agencies ammunition to createcampaigns that zeroed in on consumers’ desires with the accuracy of acruise missile, versus the fall-where-they-will gravity bomb campaignsthey used before taking surveys.\nIt’s no different today. And despite how it’s portrayed on TV and in\nmovies, working in an agency is not what most people think it is. Youdon’t just sit around and dream up clever slogans. The process of de-veloping a successful advertising campaign and accompanying materi-als does not begin with creative flashes. It begins with research .\nFor example, if you have the greatest bottled water in the world and\nyou’re trying to peddle it door-to-door in a city where the majority ofresidents have their own backyard wells, you’re out of luck. You didn’tdo your research.\nb03 cash ch 3.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 159\nCA$HVERTISING\n160Instead of spending thousands of dollars running ads trying to guess\nwhat your customers or prospects want, why not simply ask them, andthen create advertising around their responses! A clever shortcut, no?\nSo do a survey! Ask people what they think about your product or\nservice. For example, if you run a pizzeria, ask people what things aremost important to them when going out for pizza. What do they like?What do they hate? What’s the most they’d pay for an 18-inch pie withthe works? Would they come in more often if you offered two free drinkswith every large pizza? What’s their biggest complaint? How often dothey go out for—or pick up—pizza?\nTo whom do you send this survey? How about everybody within a\n5-mile radius of your pizzeria? Or maybe just your own customers. Of-fer a free slice as a thank-you for providing their feedback. Y ep... bribe\nthem to take your survey. And don’t you dare gripe about this! Theamount you spend on free slices is insignificant  compared to the value of\nthe information you’ll receive. Limit the response time to keep it undercontrol.\nA good format for a survey is a double postcard. This is simply a\npostcard that’s split with a perforation. One of the postcards has theaddress of the recipient on it. The opposite side explains the free good-ies they get for completing and returning the survey card, which is theother side of the perforation. On the opposite side of the survey card isyour return address. After completing the survey, your recipient simply\ntears on the perforation, separating both cards, and drops the surveycard in the mail. For greater response, use a Business Reply Mail permitindicia on the reply card so people aren’t put off by having to stamp it.Hey, you’re getting valuable information, so make it as easy as possiblefor people to complete your survey!\nAnother simple format is a one-page letter-size survey. You’d mail\nyour one-page letter explaining your great offer and enclose the one-page survey along with a postage-paid reply envelope addressed to yourcompany. They’ll read your letter, complete the survey, slip it into yourself-addressed, stamped envelope, and pop it in the mail. Try to keep itshort, and you may be able to get both your letter and survey on the\nfront of one 8 1/2 × 11-inch page, on both sides if necessary. This willsave paper and make the whole process less complicated to your recipi-ent because there will be fewer papers to handle. The advantage of thisformat is that it’s much easier to print yourself, and the letter and enve-lope format look more like a personal communication, which is likely to\nb03 cash ch 3.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 160\nAd-Agency Secrets\n161get greater attention. (Be sure to read Ad Agency Secret #14: The\n“Granny Rule” of Direct Mail for design tips for getting people to openyour survey letter.)\nRemember:  The secret of good survey response is ease! Make it\nsuper easy to reply. Give all multiple-choice answers if possible, and usesemantic differential  scales. For example:\nOn a scale from 1 to 10, how likely are you to go out for\npizza rather than make it yourself at home?\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\nNot Likely to Go Out         Very Likely to Go Out\nOn a scale from 1 to 10, how much better is Franko’s pizza\ncompared to store-bought\nfrozen  pizzas?\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\nFranko’s Is Worse        Franko’s Is Better\nOn a scale from 1 to 10, how likely are you to return to\nFranko’s Pizza within the next two weeks?\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\nNot Likely               Very Likely\nWouldn’t it be a shame if, after spending thousands on a new pro-\nmotion, hundreds on ads, and hundreds on your new brochure, youfind out that what you’re pushing isn’t what your customers and pros-pects want? Ugh. You need to do your research first. And doing a survey\nis the easiest and most inexpensive way to do it.\nImagine the advantages you’ll have over your competition, know-\ning exactly how your prospects feel, what they want, when they plan onreturning, and even how much they’d pay! Now imagine how foolishyou’ll feel after tallying up all the responses and thinking about all thoseridiculous promotions you ran offering the complete opposite of whatthey really  wanted. I’m confident that few—if any—of your competitors\nhave ever done it. Ad agencies respect the power of the survey and theincredible insight it provides.

This incredibly simple ideais hailed by many of the best-known advertising professionals of all time.\nDavid Ogilvy said editorial ads get 50 percent better readership.\nJohn Caples said 80 percent. Direct response specialist Richard Bensonquotes 500 to 600 percent.

Here’s how it works.\nLet’s say you’re a professional hypnotist who specializes in helping\npeople quit smoking. Instead of creating an ad that looks the same asevery other ad in your local paper, you write your ad in news-articlestyle. You have it set in the same typeface, the same column width, andthe same leading (pronounced “ledding,” and meaning the space be-tween each of your lines) as that publication’s news articles are set. Dothe same for your headline too. Your “news ad” could start out some-thing similar to this:\nLocal Hypnotist Announces New Way\nto Quit Smoking in 48 Hours\nIf you’re an Orlando resident who wants to kick the habit,\nbut you can’t seem to muster the willpower, then thisarticle brings you good news.

All hail Mr. Asa Griggs Can dler,\nthe Philadelphia pharmacist who bought the Coca-Cola company fromthe soft drink’s inventor, Dr. John Pemberton. Candler was considereda pioneer in coupon promotions. In 1894, Candler offered a refreshingglass of Coca-Cola free to anyone who redeemed one of his little hand-written tickets. This was so successful, he next offered two gallons ofCoca-Cola syrup “to any retailer or soda fountain man” who would dis-pense 128 free servings (one gallon’s worth) of the beverage to custom-ers who presented one of his coupon cards. Candler’s aggressivepromotions drove Coca-Cola into every state and territory in the UnitedStates by 1895.\nDon’t ignore coupons, no matter what kind of business you’re in.

I instructed the designer toset the copy within a coupon border of 3-point thickness with a verylight yellow tint behind the text. What an eye-catcher!\nWhen you use this idea, you’re taking advantage of what’s called an\nanchor  in neuro-linguistic programming (NLP). An anchor is a con ditioned\nresponse that’s set off by the introduction of a particular stimulus. Rus-sian scientist Ivan Pavlov rang the bell and fed the dog, rang the belland fed the dog, rang the bell and fed the dog. Soon, after all these r epeti-\ntions, he was able to make the dog drool by simply ringing the bell. Thebell was the anchor. A link between the bell and the food was made in\nthe dog’s brain, and a “conditioned reflex”—copious droo ling—r esulted.\nTo the dog, the bell actually meant  food. Pavlov termed the response\nsignalization , which later came to be known as classical conditioning.\nCA$HVERTISING  Tip: A coupon doesn’t have to be a certain size\nto be effective.

Best Frequency for E-Mailing\nHow often should you e-mail for the best response? Forrester\nResearch and NFO World Group both reported the identical conclu-sion that 31 to 35 percent of e-mail recipients prefer one mailing perweek; 18 percent said two to three days per week; 13 percent said oncea month; 12 percent said daily; 10 percent responded two to three timesper month; 6 percent said less than once a month; and the NFO studyreported that 8 percent replied “Never.”\n2. Click-Through Rates—Studies Tell What to Expect\nGas prices go up, e-mail response goes down. There’s no correla-\ntion, but it’s a reality we all must face. Studies show that click-throughrates for e-mail marketing are declining. Currently you can expect any-thing from less than 1 percent in response to poorly crafted offers e- mailed\nto rented lists, to more than 20 percent for offers containing highlyappealing incentives sent to your own customer list.\nRemember:  Click-throughs do not mean orders, but to make the\nsale your audience must, of course, first read your message.\n3. The HTML vs. Text Conundrum\nAccording to Opt-In News , more than 68 percent of all e-mail mar-\nketing is in HTML (hypertext markup language) format—or, more sim-ply, e-mail enhanced with graphics. Today, approximately 60 percent of\nb03 cash ch 3.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 166\nAd-Agency Secrets\n167e-mail users have the ability to receive these more visual e-mails. Ac-\ncording to Jupiter Research, HTML gets a 200 percent better responsethan plain text. The catch-22: Some people choose to block HTML-formatted e-mails.\nCA$HVERTISING Tip:  Do an A-B Split. Compare the response\nyou get from HTML versus text-only promo. Chop your list in half andmail each version at the same time. The increased response power of awell-constructed HTML e-mail may out-pull a text-only e-mail withhigher deliverability.\n4. Best Way to Get Your E-Mails Opened\nAccording to Opt-In News , 69 percent is the average “open rate” for\nopt-in, business-to-business ezines; 60 percent or higher is consideredexcellent. What affects your “open rate” most?\n1. Familiar sender (use your name if they’ll recognize it).2. Personal subject line (always include your recipient’s\nname).\n3. Offer of interest (precision-target your market).\n5. Ad Size and Readership\nAs is the case with print advertising, in online advertising, “sky-\nscrapers” (vertically tall ads) and “leaderboards” (large banners) are moreeffective than regular-sized banners. In addition, large ads are moreeffective than small, and interactive (DHTML) ads are more effectivethan non-interactive. These findings resulted from a study performedfor C-NET , and they confirm that human beings do not act dramati-\ncally different online or off, as print advertising research shows similarpatterns of response. So much for today’s techies who keep parrotingthe inaccurate line, “The rules for online advertising are different!” Aswith all other forms of advertising, an online banner ad will either dowell or poorly depending how well it adheres to the foundational, im-mutable principles of advertising, such as those featured in this book.\n6. Animation Click-Through Booster\nAnimated ads generate click-through rates at least 15 percent higher\nthan static, motionless ads, and in some cases as much as 40 percenthigher. Why? Movement catches attention. It’s part of a survival mecha-nism that alerts us to oncoming danger. But does this mean your ads\nb03 cash ch 3.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 167\nCA$HVERTISING\n168should be littered with movement for the sake of movement? No. Test\nsimple moving elements that enhance your sales message.\nCaution:  Rapidly flashing elements are annoying. The goal is to\nattract , not irritate. Consider transitions, wipes, fades, and other similar\nactions.\n7. Mystery Ads Score High Click-Throughs\n...but low conversion to sales. Cryptic online ads and e-mails can\nincrease click-through by 18 percent, says one study. The problem? Lotsof clicks, few sales. Why? Poor targeting. Send your mortgage solicita-tion to names in the phone book. Write on the envelope in big letters:“SEX!” Most people will open the envelope. Even those who don’t need\na mortgage. But you can’t blame them, can you? Sex and survival arethe Life-Force 8 granddaddies of them all. The problem is, “SEX!” madethem open the envelope, not your wonderful low-interest adjustable. Sonext time try: “Need a Low-Interest Mortgage?” You’re then using theright words on the right audience. Fewer will open your e-mail, butthose who do will be better prospects.\nRemember:  Don’t confuse clicks for sales.\nAd-Agency Secret #32:\nMulti-page Your Way to Success\nAd agency media buyers understand the importance of repetition.\nThey know that every time their commercial runs, they likely have onlya fraction of your attention. So they run it repeatedly in hopes of mak-ing their point. If it didn’t affect you the first 10 times you saw it, theyhope the next 50 showings will compel you to buy.\nThe same strategy applies to print advertising. You can’t just place\none ad once and be done with it. Just the same as that TV commercial,your first ad might not catch your prospects’ attention. Only a certainpercentage will read any individual insertion. That’s the importance offrequency . Extensive testing by Starch Research has shown that placing\nmore than one ad in the same issue of the same publication can beremarkably effective, and have a 1 + 1 = 3 effect that no single ad canreplicate.

I offer a\nfull one-year money-back guarantee on many of my products. Why? Itinstills confidence in buyers and puts them at ease. They think, “Drewmust feel pretty confident about this product. I have a full year to re-turn it and get all my money back. How can I lose?”\nBuyers feel vulnerable. In exchange for their hard-earned money,\nthey take a leap of faith every time they give some of it away. They won-der if what they’re buying will be worth at least the value of the moneythey’ve exchanged for it. And between the time they release their legaltender and the time they experience the product, there’s a period ofstress and uncertainty. The higher the dollar amount of the transac-tion, of course, the greater the stress. Buy a rotten apple, and it won’truin your day. But buy a house and find out five years later that the titlewas forged and you never really owned it, and say hello to an “Excedrinheadache” that’ll span six seasons.\nDuring the Great Depression, people were extremely cautious about\nspending what little money they had. Counter to the logic of the times,Hormel ran a large ad in a Chicago newspaper featuring an illustrationof an apron-clad grocer holding a can of soup in his outstretched hand.Here’s how it began:\nb03 cash ch 3.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 169\nCA$HVERTISING\n170DOUBLE YOUR MONEY BACKDOUBLE YOUR MONEY BACKDOUBLE YOUR MONEY BACKDOUBLE YOUR MONEY BACKDOUBLE YOUR MONEY BACK\n...if you don’t say this NEW Home-Style Vegetable Soup\nis the most delicious you ever bought.\nTHE OFFERTHE OFFERTHE OFFERTHE OFFERTHE OFFER Friday and Saturday only.

If you don’tagree that it’s the best vegetable soup you ever bought,return the empty container to your grocer...who is autho-rized to pay you back TWICE what you paid.\nIt was the first time an advertiser had the courage to offer a “double-\nyour-money-back” guarantee. Many fearful company execs warned,“Don’t do it! With the state of the economy, people are going to buyarmloads of soup and return them all for a big profit!”\nThe ad was a smashing success, and only 12 women took advantage\nof the guarantee. But the question is: Did the guarantee help close thesale? You better believe it did. It reduced buyers’ pre-purchase stress.And most importantly, it gave them the confidence to buy.\nEvery time your prospect thinks about buying, her head becomes a\nbattleground for two opposing forces: skepticism  and the desire to believe .\nNow, imagine an old apothecary scale with skepticism  on one side and\nthe desire to believe  on the other. Let’s say her level of skepticism is a 7 on\na scale from 1 to 10, 10 being “most skeptical.” And her desire to believe\nis a 5. It’s up to you to throw more weight onto the desire to believe  side in\norder to offset the amount of skepticism she now experiences. Includ-ing a strong guarantee helps lighten the skepticism side and press downon that desire side. Sometimes it’s all you need to clinch the sale.\nNot only do longer, stronger guarantees boost your sales, but they\n(ironically) also result in fewer returns. Why? Studies show that short-term guarantees (30, 60, or 90 days) keep customers poised to make thereturn and force them to be more conscious of the return deadline.Longer guarantees (six months, one, five, 10 years, lifetime) give pros-pects confidence in the product and avoid the “beat the clock” mindsetof using the product and sending it back within the short allotted time.\nCA$HVERTISING Tip:  Offer the longest , strongest  guarantee in\nyour industry. (Your competition will hate you for this.) Such a guaran-tee conveys your confidence in what you sell, which in turn gives pros-pects the confidence to give you their money. As a bonus, it causes\nb03 cash ch 3.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 170\nAd-Agency Secrets\n171potential buyers to question your competitors’ weak—or absent!—guar-\nantee. It also lets you ask—in big bold type—“Why Do Our Competi-tors Guarantee their [PRODUCT TYPE] for Only 90 Days?” Followed\nup with the insidious, “Do they know something about their [PROD-UCT] that they’re not telling you?”\nA well-crafted guarantee isn’t an afterthought. It’s a damned pow-\nerful sales tool—one of your most important, especially if your com-petitors’ guarantee is weak by comparison. Show off your guarantee,don’t hide it! Surround it with a fancy certificate border and print yoursignature under it. Include it in your ads, on brochures, your Website,everywhere. Be proud of it! And watch it perform wonders for you.\nAd-Agency Secret #34:\nThe Psychology of Size\nFact:  Bigger ads attract more attention. This idea has been tested by\nvarious researchers using different methodologies, and they’ve all cometo this same conclusion. What hasn’t  been quantified, however, is just\nhow much of a proportional increase in attention a larger ad will consis-tently deliver. Research has shown this: the attention value of ads is not in\ndirect proportion to its increased size . In other words, increasing the size of\nyour ad four times will not, in general, multiply the number of readersby four.\nSo if your boss, client, partner, or spouse says, “Hey, we got 100\nreplies to our quarter-page ad. Blow it up to a full-page ad so we’ll get400 replies,” you need to sit him or her down and have a little talk.\nIn the following table, the attention value  of a quarter-page ad is\nrepresented as 100 percent. Likewise, the attention value of both thehalf- and full-page ads are calculated as a ratio to the value of thequar ter-page ad.\nOkay, let’s make this easy. In applied psychologist Walter Dill Scott’s\nexperiment (first column, bold type), he had subjects read magazines attheir own pace and later asked, “What ads do you remember?” Notethat the half-page ad (which was two times the area of the quarter-page)scored 300 percent, or three times the attention . The full-page ad (which\nwas four times the area of the quarter page) scored 666 percent, or morethan six times the attention. Scott’s conclusion: Attention value exceeds\nincrease of ad size. This would mean you could double your ad size and\nget far more than double the attention. Great, right? But wait...\nb03 cash ch 3.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 171\nCA$HVERTISING\n172Stanford University researcher E.K. Strong (creator of The Strong\nInterest Inventory , used today to help people make career choices) be-\nlieved that using real magazines would skew the test results. “Hey guys,it’s not just ad  size that’s influencing your subjects...it’s the ads them-\nselves!” So Strong created a dummy  magazine—a mock-up—for his ex-\nperiment. The results showed that the attention value for the larger adsdid not increase as dramatically as in Scott’s experiment. Strong’s\nConclusion: Attention value lags behind increase of ad size .\nNew York University Professor G.B. Hotchkiss’s study had similar\nresults. Without mentioning anything about the ads themselves, he in-structed students in his class to read an article in a magazine, and laterasked them to recall what ads they saw.\nHow about our buddy Daniel Starch? In his classic Analysis of Over\nThree Million Coupons  published in 1927, he collected 1,400,000 replies\nfrom 907 different ads from various advertisers. This mind-bogglinglyextensive study produced results not unlike those of Strong, Hotchkiss,and Adams. Look at the Starch data and you’ll see that a half-pagescores 68 percent better than a quarter-page and a full-page slightlymore than 300 percent better than the quarter.\nStarch’s conclusion: Attention value lags behind increase of ad size . Starch\nsaid, “Advertisements brought replies very nearly in proportion to theirsize, although the smaller sizes had a slight advantage. This may havebeen due to the possibility that the smaller advertisements...placed moreemphasis on securing responses.”\nUniversity of Michigan psychology professor Henry Adams didn’t\nlike anyone’s  studies.

Magazines?  Gone! Articles?\nRemoved! Pictures?  Eliminated! Instead, Adams whipped out his scis-\nsors and pasted up colored squares in four different sizes: one inch,one and a half, two, and three square inches. Talk about minimalism.Using a tachistoscope—a short-exposure projection device used to helptrain WWII fighter pilots to identify enemy aircraft—he exposed hissubjects to the material four squares at a time. Long story short: Hisresults were similar to all the others.\nSo how can we make sense of all this crazy research in a way that’s\npractical for us as advertisers? It boils down to this: an ad’s attention\nvalue is approximately  proportionate to the square root of the area . Huh? Okay,\nthis means that if you want to double the attention your ad’s now get-ting, you need to enlarge it 400 percent. (So if it’s a quarter-page ad,you need to run a full-pager.) To triple the attention, blow it up 900percent (which is practical only if you’re starting out with a very smallad such as a classified display). You’d otherwise have to go to a multi-page ad, as described in Ad Agency Secret #32: Multi-Page Your Way toSuccess.\nSo now you have a rule of thumb that tells you how to boost the\nnumber of eyeballs that roll across your ads.

Dozens of experiments\nhave been made by various researchers in the United States and abroadon the question of consumer color preferences.

Here,in a nutshell, are the compiled rankings.\nThe number-one preference for most people tested is blue, with red\na close second, then green, violet, orange, and yellow, ranked exactly inthat order. Look at your current sales materials—online and off—andsee if they reflect these worldwide findings.\nUnfortunately, not all graphic designers are aware of this research\n(they should be), so it’s up to you to specify the colors you’d like most\nprominently featured.\nBattles of the Oranges\nMen and women differ only slightly in color preferences.

The universal preference\nfor it may have some connection with what takes place inside the aginghuman eye. Look inside an old man’s (or woman’s) eye, and you’ll seethat the optical lens has hazed, or yellowed. In fact, the lens of thechild’s eye may absorb only 10 percent of the blue light, whereas anelderly eye may absorb 85 percent of blue light. One theory is that this isnature’s way of protecting the eye against painfully bright light as we age.\nMost-Loved Color Combos\nHow much money is spent on multi-color ads every year? Billions.\nBut are some color combinations actually preferred by more people thanothers? Let’s take a look…\nAccording to artists, the primary colors are red, yellow, and blue.\nMany insist that the best color combinations are those that do not “crossa primary.” Unlike artists, psychologists believe there are actually fourprimary colors: red, green, yellow, and blue. They insist that the bestcolor combinations are those that employ complementary colors. Littleexperimentation has been done, so the jury is still out, but the studiesthat have been done do show similarities in results.\nIn one experiment by our ol’ researcher buddy Daniel Starch, 10\nads of two predominant colors each were ranked in preference.

What’s more, color also encourages more in-depthreading by:\n✸60 percent over black-and-white only ads.\n✸40 percent over two-color only ads.\nIn fact, color does more to affect whether your ad gets seen than\ndoes size. So if it costs less to add color than it does to run a larger ad,opt for color. In fact, research says that there’s a bigger difference inreadership between a black-and-white and a four-color ad than there isbetween a one- and two-page color ad!\nBlack & white ads work best when emphasizing end\nbenefits, demonstrating dramatic situations and\nappealing to the intellect.\n—Starch Research\nAd-Agency Secret #38:\nThe Psychology of Pricing\nWhat’s the difference between $19.98 and $20.00? No, I don’t mean\ntwo cents. (I can figure that out myself.) I mean, psychologically, moti-\nvationally, persuasively?\nIt’s psychological pricing , and you see it used everywhere from de-\npartment stores to restaurants to furniture retailers, even jewelers. Wal-Mart is known for its heavy use of psychological pricing, with theirfavorite end digits being “97.”\nOdd-even  pricing theory says that prices ending in odd amounts\nsuch as 77, 95, and 99 suggest greater value than prices rounded up tothe next whole dollar. $9.77 seems like a better deal than $10.00. And64 cents for a pound of bananas seems to be an okay price...but 70cents? You gotta be kidding! But it’s more than the idea of saving a fewcents. For advertisers like you and me, the effects of such a seeminglysimple technique can be dramatic.\nPrestige  pricing, by contrast, says that if you want something to be\nperceived as higher quality, you use only rounded  whole numbers when\npricing. For example, $1,000.00 suggests higher quality than $999.95,\nb03 cash ch 3.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 178\nAd-Agency Secrets\n179simply because we’ve been conditioned to interpret fractional  pricing  as\nsuggestive of value. Upscale retailer Nordstrom department store usesprestige pricing, and so do many fine jewelers and other sellers of high-end merchandise. Surf over to SaksFifthAvenue.com and you’ll see only00s. In fact, the only cents you’ll see are in the prices of the few featured\nsale items.\nFractional pricing  is more widespread than you probably realize.\nResearchers Holdershaw, Gendall, and Garland (1997) found that ap-proximately 60 percent of advertised retail prices ended in 9, 30 per-cent ended in 5, 7 percent ended in 0, and the remaining seven digits,combined, accounted for just more than 3 percent of the prices studied.\nBut why does this work? Psychologists say that (1) fractional pricing\nsuggests that the seller has calculated the lowest possible price, thusthe odd number, and (2) we ignore the last digits rather than mentallyrounding up. Doing so allows us to justify a purchase that may be teetering on\nthe threshold of affordability.\nSchindler and Kibarian (1996) tested odd pricing using three ver-\nsions of a direct-mail women’s clothing catalog. All three catalogs wereidentical, except for the prices, which ended in 00, 88, and 99. Thewinner? The 99 catalog produced 8 percent greater sales and more buy-ers than the 00 version. The 88 catalog pulled in as many sales andbuyers as the 00 version.\nIn 2000, Rutgers University did a study of people reading an ad for\na woman’s dress. The subjects reported that the dress priced at $49.99was of lower quality than the same ad featuring the exact same  dress\npriced at an even $50.\nInterestingly enough, people make some fascinating rationalizations\nfor fractional prices. For example, Schindler (1984) found that con-sumers who see a price ending in 98 or 99 are more likely to believe thatthe price was not recently raised. (How anyone jumps to that conclu-sion I’ll never understand.)\nAccording to Quigley and Notarantonio (1992), subjects who saw\nan ad with a 98 or 99 ending price were much more likely to believe theproduct was on sale than products with 00 end prices.\nWhat about prices ending in 95? Are they as effective as 99? Re-\nsearch shows they’re not. Likewise, 49, 50, and 90 are also not sugges-tive of low price. But evidence shows that prices ending in 79, 88, and98 do convey value.\nb03 cash ch 3.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 179\nCA$HVERTISING\n180Psychological pricing isn’t a random game of picking numbers out\nof a hat, it’s a well-researched topic with great implications for yourbottom line. And now that you’ve read what consumers think and whatresearch recommends, how do your prices look now?\nAd-Agency Secret #39:\nThe Psychology of Color\nPaint a prison’s walls pink, and there’s less inmate violence. Put a\nbaby in a yellow room, and the crying begins. Want to suppress yourappetite? Try the “Blue Wall Diet Plan.” Likewise, red classrooms hypekids up, blue rooms chill them out. Volunteer fundraisers who wearpink uniforms get bigger donations, and sage-green hospital corridorsease patients’ frazzled nerves.\nColor affects us strongly, including our perception of weight . For\nexample, lifting and carrying boxes all day long can be a real drag. So togive its employees some relief, a manufacturer painted their heavy-lookingblack boxes light green. Voila! Psychologically “lighter” boxes. To makeits packaging look heavier, a food manufacturer changed to a darker-colored package. Voila! “More” food inside.\nDon’t confuse this phenomenon with fashion experts’ advice to wear\nblack for its “slimming” effect. Because of its ability to hide shadowscaused by “beer and brownie bulges,” black clothing helps smooth thebody’s contours. This in turn causes less attention to be paid to indi-vidual “problem areas” by presenting the body’s outline as a single opti-cal unit without specific points of interest. That’s why bodybuilderslook beefier in white and light-colored shirts. All those shadows—readily contrasted against the light-colored cloth—add depth to theirmusculature.\nThis “darker is heavier” illusion is called apparent weight . And it’s\nsimply a matter of choosing the right color to give you the weight percep-\ntion you’re looking for.\nIn an article in the American Journal of Psychology  entitled “The Ef fect\nof Color on Apparent Size and Weight,” psychologists Warden and Flynnran some tests. They put eight boxes—all the same size—in a glassdisplay case. They had people randomly look at each box, in varyingorder, and asked them to rank the boxes according to how much theythought they weighed. Here are the results, from lightest to heaviest:\nb03 cash ch 3.pmd 10/8/2008, 4:10 PM 180\nAd-Agency Secrets\n181Color can even affect taste. Dr Pepper Snapple Group’s Barrelhead\nSugar-Free Root Beer was advertised as full-bodied, draught-style rootbeer. When packaging experts Berni Corp. changed the backgroundcolor on the cans of their sugar-free beverage to beige from blue, peoplereported that it tasted more like good-old-fashioned frosty-mug rootbeer, even though the recipe never changed. Similarly, consumers saythat darker-colored orange drinks taste sweeter.\nColors—if strongly associated with other products—can also con-\nfuse. In the beverage industry, for example, Coca-Cola “owns” the colorred. When Berni Corp. designers changed Canada Dry’s sugar-free gin-ger ale can from red to green and white, sales shot up more than 25percent. The red can had made consumers think “cola.”\nBecause of its power to not only draw attention, but also alter percep-\ntion in ways that even the experts can’t explain, ad agencies are hyper-\nsensitive to how they use color in their ads and packaging. And nowthat we know these facts, you and I should be too.\nResults from a study of 21 languages revealed that\nwords for basic colors enter language almost univer-\nsally in the following order:1.  Black and white. 2. Red.\n3. Green or yellow. 4. Yellow or green. 5. Blue.\n6. Brown. 7.

It’s another one of those little-\nknown and little-used agency secrets revealed by decades-old testingthat can give your ad response a lift.\nBuy more ad space—say a half-page instead of a quarter—but in-\nstead of filling it with more copy an d pictures, put your original quarter-\npage ad smack in the center of it, wrapping your ad with white space.Multiple experiments by researchers Poffenberger and Strong concludethat, for example, a white-wrapped quarter-page ad will get more atten-tion than a fully fleshed-out half-page ad loaded with text and graph-ics. Poffenberger’s tests showed the following improvements due towhite-wrapping:\nThe Attention Increase of White-Wrap Isolation\nStrong advises that the additional space purchased should not ex-\nceed 60 percent of the area of the advertisement itself. According toStrong, “If more than 60 percent is used, the increased cost will not becompensated by a corresponding increase in attention value. Further-more, about 20 percent additional used as white space about the adver-tisement gives the greatest increase in effectiveness, cost considered.”\nAd-Agency Secret #41:\nGive Yourself a “Cleverectomy”\nIt’s frustrating.

Some-\nthing like, “Only $250 Keeps You from Getting Caught in aSticky Web on the Net.”\nDrew: [Suppressing a laugh] The purpose of your headline is not to\nbe “catchy,” Scott. It’s to be effective. Being creative for thesake of being creative is a waste of time and money, and is acomplete misunderstanding of the principles of creating aheadline. Allowing yourself to be seduced by the thrill of cre-ating a “clever” headline that will impress friends and family(but not your prospects) is a terrible mistake! Besides, that“Sticky Web” headline is ridiculous! It doesn’t tell the readerwhat you’re selling! And because 60 percent of people whoread ads read only the headlines—they scan—you’ll lose atleast 60 percent of your audience.

It’snot a creativity contest. It’s not meant to grace the walls of theLouvre in Paris. It’s also not poetry, comedy, or a riddle to befigured out.

He began creating advertising at age 11 by writing and design-\ning direct-response catalogs of jokes, gags, and novelties. Complete withproduct illustrations, order forms, and postage charts, he distributedthem to his 5th grade classmates by the armful and collected cash or-ders in equal abundance. Although his teachers did not encourageDrew’s entrepreneurial spirit (they would have preferred that he haddone his homework rather than sold whoopee cushions), it marked thebeginning of an exciting career in the wacky and wonderful world ofcreative writing and advertising.\nMany years later, after extensive e xperience in face-to-face selling of\neverything from printing to clothing and jewelry to real estate, a degree\nin advertising from Temple University started the ball rolling. Today,Drew is an outspoken, humorous, and philosophical advertising trainerand writer. He worked for the direct-response division of the largest ad-agency in Philadelphia. He was also senior direct response copywriterfor one of the largest direct-to-the-consumer insurance companies inthe world. He created powerfully effective advertising for companiesranging from small retail shops to giant, multi-million dollar corpora-tions.
