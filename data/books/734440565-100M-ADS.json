You\nprobably even have the urge to leave a negative comment or leave some\ncolorful words below.\nAnd that’s ok, I get it. Everybody talks a big game these days.\nBut this story is real and these “2 comma club” plaques I’m holding here\nbelow are shown to PROVE it. That I’ve done 7 figures in online high ticket\nfitness before I ever tried teaching a single trainer what they should or\nshouldn’t do.\nNow…\nIf you got into the fitness industry because you have a passion for it, you're\nwilling to do the work, and you just want to help more people.\nBut you just have no idea who is telling the truth or where you should even\nstart, then I want you to keep reading.\nMy name is Tanner Chidester and just a few years ago I was living at my\nparents’ house with a 16-year-old mazda protégé in my possession and\n$2000 to my name at the age of 23. Talk about “living the dream” lol.\nI was a former division 1 football athlete and used to being “Big Man On\nCampus” and so the embarrassment and self-esteem issues at the time were\nat an all-time high.\nI had just left petroleum engineering school to “pursue my business dream”\nand my girlfriend at the time told me “I wouldn’t ever make it and I was dumb\nfor doing this.”\nw w w . c l i e n t g e n e r a t o r s . c o m\nMy own family was talking behind my back and always would slide in\ncomments about “how is the business going?” You get the picture, nobody\nthought I was going to be successful.\nSo, my online training journey began…\nI started working every day for hours on end on my “low ticket” $47 offers. I\nthought I was going to be the next “big thing” in the online space.\nI was also working as a server, door to door salesman, and doing any odd\njobs I could find to get by.\nAnd over the next two years I made a grand total of $2000 in my business. I\nalmost quit like five times and now at the age of 25 I was starting to think\neverybody else was right.\nIf it weren’t for a dear friend and mentor that just told me to keep going I\nwouldn’t be where I am today.\nSo, as a final attempt to be successful I hired a business coach. I remember to\nthis day my heart was pounding. “It’s $5000 to join.”\nI almost cried. I didn’t have that money. I only made $2000 a month and after\nrent I had maybe a $500 left. But I knew this was my final hope, so I took the\nplunge. I applied for a credit card and prayed to god that this “thing” would\nwork.\nAnd it did…kinda.\nYou see over these last two years I had failed a lot, but I had built MASSIVE\nskills in sales and communication. Door to door sales and being a server will\nhave that effect on you. So, when I got into this program I was primed for\ngrowth.\nBut here’s what irritated me.\nAlthough I started making a lot of money (30-50k months) the entire strategy\nwas cold outreach.\nw w w . c l i e n t g e n e r a t o r s . c o m\nMessage, Message, and Message some more. Now I’m one of the hardest\nworkers on the planet, I truly believe that. I was spending 12-16 hours a day\nmessaging as fast as I could and as many people as I could to get this thing\noff the ground.\nAnd it worked, but how sustainable does that sound to you?\nEven if you could message people all day long and make money how long\ncan you keep that up before you’d burn out?\nI knew I had a short amount of time to figure out a better way before I’d be\nright back in the same situation I started in.\nSo, what did I do? I hired even MORE coaches.\nBut the next few experiences didn’t go so well, in fact I lost a lot of money. And\nafter 5 more coaches and another $50,000 (to date I’ve now spent over 115k) I\nwas ready to quit again. I was burnt out from messaging and I just figured a\n9-5 had to be less stress.\nBut then something happened…\nI tested one final method (that I use to this day) and it worked.\nLike really worked...WITHOUT any cold outreach or hours of mindless\nmessaging hoping to get a reply.\nAnd I grew…FAST. So, fast that I got to 7 figures in just 12 months and I’ve never\nlooked back. And heck I even have a life now outside of work :)\nBut most trainers I knew were still struggling with the same old cold outreach\nmethod. So, what did I do?\nI started a second business. This time helping other trainers to REPLICATE the\ntype of success I’ve had (I still have my other fitness business running\nsimultaneously. Most coaches can’t say that) because let’s be honest.\nIf you can even do 5% of what I did/do in a month now you’ll be living a VERY\ngood life. You don’t have to be “as good as me,” just a fraction.\nw w w . c l i e n t g e n e r a t o r s . c o m\nAnd as of now I truly believe I am the most qualified person out there to be\nteaching this. Sure, I’m biased and sure lots of coaches have good intentions,\nbut when you can’t even get your bills paid that doesn’t matter much.\nI’m not even going to hard sell you on this because I’m blessed to work with\nhundreds and hundreds of clients at this point, but if this has resonated with\nyou and you just “get it” I want to invite you to do 3 things.\n1. Click the link to view the short training\n2. Apply to speak with me or my team if you like what you see.\n3. We’ll hop on a call and figure out the perfect strategy for you together.\nAll I ask in return is that you are an action taker, you really want to get people\nresults, and you’re willing to do the work.\nSpeak soon.\nTanner\nw w w . c l i e n t g e n e r a t o r s . c o m\nA D\n#\n5\nI felt stuck…\nI wasn't fulfilled in my Accounting job, but I didn't know what else to do.\nMy alarm clock would go off, I'd open my eyes and I'd realize it's a weekday...\nthat meant it was a workday.\nI'd sigh, get out of bed, and mindlessly go through the motions of moving my\nbody to my cubicle.\nI was so used to this that I basically \"zoned out\" most of the week just so I\ncould get through it.\nI knew I wanted more. I'd taken the actions that society had convinced me I\nneeded to in order to achieve success (I went to college and got a good job in\naccounting), but I found out very quickly that I was not fulfilled at all by any of\nthat.\nI questioned if my dreams were possible, or even real.\nI hated working at the accounting firm, but I didn't have much choice at the\ntime.\nI was SO frustrated, overwhelmed and confused.\nI lived for the weekends and spent my days wishing time would pass quicker.\nNow that I know what I know now, I can't believe I wished so much of my life\naway.\nSo I searched relentlessly for alternatives…\nI had so much motivation and read every book I could on becoming\nsuccessful, but was still so lost and confused about what to do with this\nmotivation.\nw w w . c l i e n t g e n e r a t o r s . c o m\nUNTIL ONE DAY I FIGURED IT OUT.\nI learned how to create a full time online income with different businesses.\nI also learned that I could teach people how to do the same.\nI went to work applying these new methods and saw incredible results.\nOver the next 18 months, I went on to quit my job and made over $10,000,000\nselling digital courses and helping students from all over the world quit their\njobs and achieve financial freedom.\nPeople started noticing my results and talking about my story and before long\nI had people asking me to teach them how to start their own digital course\nbusinesses and create a passive income source.\nThey were so intrigued with what I was doing, and were well aware of the\nbenefits of creating a digital course.\nSoon students started seeing results, some even better than my own which\nshowed me that we had a successful and replicable strategy.\nBy popular demand, I decided to open my digital course strategy to the\npublic and to teach everyone the power of digital courses.\nI called it Digital Course Secrets - and I put together a FREE Training to show\nyou how...\nI created DCS to teach you how to break free from the unfulfilling cycle that I\nexperienced and millions settle for daily.\nIt makes me so proud to say that we've been able to show so many students\na way out.\nWe've done this through teaching them how to choose a niche for their\ncourse, how to become an expert in their field even without loads of\nexperience and how to find a passionate group of students that will beg to\nbuy their course.\nw w w . c l i e n t g e n e r a t o r s . c o m\nOur students who have implemented our teachings have completely\ntransformed their lives.\nWant to know what we shared with these students ?\nI spent the past few months putting together a free training for you showing\nyou *exactly* how I got started and grew my digital course business into the\nmillions.

And in the\nlast 2 years I’ve spent dozens of hours with him and Chris (my business\npartner), breaking down everything he’s learned in 50 years of marketing and\nover 8 BILLION dollars in sales.\nOne of the biggest things I learned from Jay is that there are only (at the max)\nfive different kinds of wealth you can build in a business.\nNot 12. Not 16. FIVE.\nObviously, inside these 5 categories are different “tactics,” but categorically,\nthere are just five different kinds or “types” of business wealth.\nI asked Jay if I could share with our crew and he said “Of course as long as\nyou give me credit.” Haha.\nSo I’ve put together a training overview — which will break down these\ndifferent types of wealth and a few “how to” items regarding what to do to\nimplement this stuff.\nIf your goal is long term stability, consistency, longevity, security, control (etc\nyou get the gist) — you’re gonna want to take 15 minutes and watch this\ntraining and implement what I teach you.\nw w w . c l i e n t g e n e r a t o r s . c o m\nIf you can’t do it right now, save this post for later.\nIt’ll be worth it :-)\nNothing ventured, nothing gained…\n-Taylor\nw w w . c l i e n t g e n e r a t o r s . c o m\nA D\n#\n1 0\n🤮\nI'm sick of it.\nThere's so much skepticism out there.\nAnd it's rightfully so…\nStarting an online business has been INFECTED by lies and deceit.\nI don't have the houses, the cars, or the women.\nAll I have is ONE SKILL.\nThat one skill is teaching other people how to create insanely profitable\nbusiness quickly by selling on Amazon FBA.\nAmazon has the customers, but it's not that simple…\nFor the first 6 months of my journey selling on Amazon FBA, I leaned heavily on\nmy \"Amazon Crutch\".\nThis crutch would hold me up no matter what stupid logic I threw at it!\n\"yeah the product is the exact same as my competitor but it doesn't matter,\nAmazon is so big there is enough to go around..\"\n\"I don't have to have the best quality, as long as I'm better than those losers\non page 10!\"\nAnd on it went.\nI lost $20,000+ investing my life savings in products that were destined to fail\nlong before I pulled out my wallet.\nBut all over the internet I saw success.\nw w w . c l i e n t g e n e r a t o r s . c o m\nCars, houses, screenshots beyond belief.\nI had to figure it out!\nI scoured the internet, looked at all the \"secret chat rooms\" that weren't\ninfected by \"gurus\"\nI tested, I threw products away, I held a bonfire in my backyard.\nAnd suddenly one of them went crazy.\n10k\n20k\n30k\n50k\nper month\nBut I was still screwed. I didn't know what was different about this one product.\nThere were so many factors...\nI kept digging, I called seller support, I posted the product publically and got\nthousands of people's feedback.\nAnd eventually, months later, I mapped out what I thought was the \"formula\".\nIt was pretty close.\nNext product made me 20k per month.\nThis is when the breakthrough happened…\nBefore, I only had bad products to compare to bad products.\nNow I had a great one to compare to an average one.\nw w w . c l i e n t g e n e r a t o r s . c o m\nThe difference was glaring, it blinded me with how obvious it was.\nHere's what I learned.\n1) Small Budget Economics (The Prize)\nCompeting on Amazon is more about ducking all the big dogs than it is about\nrunning in there wild and optimistic.\nI learned that all my good products were in categories that 7 of the top 10\nproducts had more than 5k in revenue each.\nSimply put, they had high demand, duh, but spread out over the whole top 10\nwhich was key.\nI also saw that 7 out of the top 10 products in my category had less than 75\nreviews.\nI almost laughed for 5 days when I figured this out.\nI'd been looking at it backwards.\nI was looking for a \"slot\" in the top 10 that had little reviews.\nLike that guy has 10 reviews and everyone else has 3,000 I'll just take his spot!\nWRONG.\nThe whole market (top 10) needed to be favorable.\nFinally, I realized that my profits were directly related to, well, profits...\nhahahahaha seriously.\nHow dumb is this that it's amazing.\nThe products that won?\nThey had 200% ROI\nw w w . c l i e n t g e n e r a t o r s . c o m\nThat meant I could buy 2 with the 1 that I had sold :)\n2) A Stress Free Supply Chain\nI sent my first products to my house.\nAnd by house I mean my 400sq ft studio apartment at the time....\nBy the time I packed the 500 boxes into my 2000 Nissan Maxima and got\nthem to UPS and paid to get them to Amazon my margins dipped and I\nliterally almost threw my back out... lol\nNot to mention the failed shipment of baby hooded towels that I had to\nrepackage by hand that took 20 hours.\nNow, for products that make us a ton of money, we just send straight from our\nsupplier to Amazon.\nI haven't seen a box in over a year and a half, and I've never been happier (or\nmaking more money)\n3) Autopilot Paradise\nAdvertising. Wow. Nothing brings a business greater joy than being able to\nbring customers in the door.\nProblem was, I tried to do it all manually at first.\nI was up all hours of the night optimizing my PPC campaigns and stressing\nout that I was spending $50 to sell a $15 dollar product and literally\nPaying.\nAmazon.\nfor the privilege of selling on their platform…\nIt was a joke, but I wasn't laughing.\nw w w . c l i e n t g e n e r a t o r s . c o m\nFinally, I figured out how to optimize these campaigns, to make them run like\na machine.\nThey got smarter and smarter the longer they ran.\nInstead of spending more money to acquire a customer, the spent LESS, yet\nacquired MORE.\nIf that's not backwards happiness inducing magic I don't know what is.\nThese three things flipped the switch for our company.\nThey transformed it from barely alive to a $4,000,000 per year profit churning\nmasterpiece.\nThey lifted me up out of a studio apartment where I could barely walk to an\napartment in the sky downtown where I drink my morning coffee across from\nmy wife.\nIf you don't want to stress about selling on Amazon, you should probably learn\nfrom me and NOT do what I did.\nDon't go at it alone, come learn how to do it properly.\nHere's a link to a 100% FREE Amazon FBA Training that actually doesn't suck.\nI mean that.\nIt's quite incredible, and I'm hosting.\nIf you got value out of this, click this link right now and come hang out for a\nlittle longer -->\n( L I N K )\nw w w . c l i e n t g e n e r a t o r s . c o m\nA D\n#\n1 1\nWhat would you do with $5 a day?\nA cup of coffee at Starbucks?\nAn à la carte side item at a café?\n$5 won’t buy you much in this world….it won’t even buy you a T-shirt.\nBut for LESS than $5 a day, you can have access to Cardone University.\nAt just $99 a month, it’s actually about $3.30 per day...\nHere is what you will get and more…\n✔\nAccess to Cardone University\n✔\n800+ Business Courses\n✔\nPrivate Facebook Community\n✔\nExclusive Grant Cardone Live Streams\n✔\nPrivate Grant Cardone Q&A Sessions\n✔\nAccess to Never Before Released Content\n✔\nAccess to Live Weekly Training Sessions\n✔\nMembership Pricing on Products and Events\nBuilding the income, the business, and the life that you want can seem\nimpossible, but it doesn’t have to be.\nLeverage the expertise of our entire community of over 10,000 success\nminded entrepreneurs and the experience of Grant Cardone.

It's not big affiliate\npartners, and it's not with a big email list. In fact, this was one of the simplest\nlaunches I've ever seen.\nWhen my buddy Joseph Michael told me about his launch, I immediately\nasked him to show me behind the scenes...\nWhen he opened it up I was really surprised by the simplicity of the whole\nthing...\nAt the heart of it all is a 6-part email sequence. That's it. 6 emails.\nIt's seriously effective, but simple enough for anyone to model.\nAnd here's the kicker…\nNot only did he give me a copy of the entire sequence he used. He also gave\nme permission to share it with y'all…\nIf you want to download a copy, just click here and I'll send it over (for free)\n-->\n( L I N K )\nSeriously, if you're an online course creator you've gotta check this out.\nThere's one email that goes out each day for 4 days, then 2 emails on the last\nday. 5 days of emails that lead to over $20k in sales\nWhen I was looking at them in more details I noticed two more things:\nw w w . c l i e n t g e n e r a t o r s . c o m\n1. 82% of sales came from the Monday emails.\n2.

I was rejected, humiliated, forced to draw up proposals that nobody\neven looked at and ended up depressed with nothing to show for it but a\n$60,000 debt.\nI didn't understand why the advice that was given to me in all of the books\nand all of the websites online didn't work.  My girlfriend left me because I\ncouldn't even afford to take her out to dinner and worked 15 hours a day\nstressed out of my mind with a pay grade lower than a 14 year on his first day\nat Mcdonalds.\nI tried everything to get clients and none of it worked.  Then one day I thought\nto myself:  \"Instead of begging people for 5-minutes of their time and going to\nthem, what if there was a way to make them come to me instead?\".\nI went back to the drawing board and stayed up days and nights on end\nfiguring out ways where I could completely flip the model and make clients\ncome to me instead.\nThen one day i figured it out!\nI went to work applying this new method for attracting and winning high value\nclients and it worked like magic.  1 client, 2 clients, 3 clients and then it caught\nfire and I had more clients than I could possibly handle and had to actually\nSTOP marketing so I could catch up on the work.\nOver the next 12 months I made $100,000.  The next year - $500,000.  The next\n$1,200,000.  The next - $2,400,000 and now this year (2016) I have already\nmade $6,000,000 and we're only 6 months in.\nw w w . c l i e n t g e n e r a t o r s . c o m\nI moved out of my parents garage in New Zealand and moved to a 28th floor\napartment in Manhattan.

This was BIG money!\nPeople started noticing my results and talking about my story and before long\nI had people asking me to teach them how to start their own consulting\nbusinesses and get high paying clients of their own.\nAt first I said \"No\" because I honestly didn't believe that anybody else could do\nwhat I was doing.  I thought I was unique and that nobody else would be able\nto make it work.  But this one guy Stanley just wouldn't give up and he was\nconsistent as hell!  He would email me 2-3 times per day telling me he\nwanted to learn my methods and that he was even willing to pay me.\nAfter a few months of non-stop messages I gave in and decided to try\nteaching my methods to Stanley.  I didn't even think it would work for him but\nhe begged me to do it...  We jumped on Skype calls twice per week and I\ntaught him my process from start to finish.\nWithin three weeks I couldn't believe it... Stanley got his first $10,000 client.  I\nalmost fell off my chair!  Stanley went from knowing NOTHING about business\nor consulting and within three weeks he picked up his very first client for\n$10,000.\nI wondered if this could be replicated again so I accepted five more people\nand showed them how to do it and then BAM - they started getting clients\ntoo!  Then I started working with more people, the groups grew from 10 to 20 to\n30 and I kept teaching them my same methods and they kept getting results.\nFast Forward to this current day and I now have 136 consultants making\n6-figure incomes AND 9 consultants making million dollar incomes from my\nadvice and trainings.\nIt's honestly hard to believe how this happened so fast.

We found it.\n“So what is it?”\nWe get leads for small businesses using paid ads.\n(That we place on Facebook and Google.)\nThose leads get forwarded to the biz owner, who happily pays us four figures\na month to keep ‘em coming.\n“Why would they do that?”\nBecause they don’t know how to do it themselves, nor do they want to, and\nthe leads make ‘em 5-10 times what they’re paying us.\n“Good for you — why should I care?”\nWell, if you’re sick of going slow, you might wanna look into building your own\n“ad agency.”\nAll you need is a computer, some common sense, and a lil’ hustle.\nWe can teach you the rest.\n“And why would you do that?”\nw w w . c l i e n t g e n e r a t o r s . c o m\nBecause we’re already doing it ourselves, every single day — why not\nmonetize the how-to as well?\n“Won’t that make it saturated for you?”\nNah, there’s millions of businesses who need this service. Even if we had a\nsmall army helping us, we couldn’t even put a dent in all that potential.\n“But I’ve never done anything like this…”\nNeither had we. But it’s quick and easy to learn — if you’re coachable.\n“What if I don’t have much time?”\nAll it takes is a few hours to make an ad campaign that crushes it for one of\nthese businesses.\nAfter that, it’s pretty much set-and-forget.\nZero begging, babysitting, blogging, or back-linking required.\n“Yeah, but I don’t have money for paid ads.”\nWho does? We make the business owner pay for the ads and the few tools we\nneed to run the entire operation… and that’s on top of our monthly fee!\n“Okay, but how will I get clients?”\nIt’s easier than you think.\nThese business owners don’t care that you’re a no-name with no past clients\nor that you’re wearing sweats, lounging on the couch, working on a laptop.\nNone of that matters when you use the idiot-proof strategy I reveal in this\nvideo:\n( L I N K )\nw w w . c l i e n t g e n e r a t o r s . c o m\nIn 23-minutes, I show you exactly how to do this explosive online biz, starting\nfrom scratch.\nTotally free.\nJust enter a valid email and I’ll send it straight to your inbox:\n( L I N K )\n“Great, another stupid webinar pitch… disguised as training.”\nNope.

The reality is... they’re kind of right.\nLet me explain:\nIn 380 BC, Plato told a story called the Allegory of the Cave. In his story, Plato\ndescribes a group of people in a cave chained to the wall. The only things\nthese people see are shadows of what’s happening behind them.\nThe shadows represent their reality. The reflections on the wall are the ONLY\nthings they believe.\nThen Plato introduces the Philosopher — a person freed from chains. The\nPhilosopher steps outside the cave and realizes, there’s an entire world out\nthere.\nThe Philosopher doesn’t accept reality for what it is. Instead, he or she\nexplores other opportunities, sets skepticism aside, and understands reality\nfor what it can be!\nPeople who immediately cast doubt on my SMMA program are not\nnecessarily wrong. They’re simply living in their own version of reality, so in\ntheir world — they’re “right”.\nMeanwhile, those who’ve “broken free” and have actually followed through\nwith the lessons, are seeing amazing results.\nThe numbers back this up.\n2 years and 35,000+ customers later, I’m STILL getting success stories about\nmy Social Media Marketing Agency program every day.\nI’ve featured some of them on this page:\n( L I N K )\nw w w . c l i e n t g e n e r a t o r s . c o m\nThe way the SMMA program works is simple.\nAfter investing in the program, a private username / password grants access\nto 80+ online video tutorials.\nThe videos, made by me and other social media marketers, reveal 60+ hours\nof specific and proven techniques for starting and scaling an agency.\nLessons in SMMA are designed to help beginners, so being new or\ninexperienced isn’t a problem.\nSMMA isn’t meant to mislead. This is why I’ve included a 100% money-back\nguarantee.\nI’m not going to push a hard sell on this. I’m simply making it available for\nthose willing to make positive changes in their life.\nThere’s a world of opportunity, freedom, and security out there. Those who see\nit, benefit. Those who don’t, broadcast their doubt.\nLiving a better life is a choice.\nThe link below will help anyone build the lifestyle they want, instead of the one\nthey’ve been chained to.\n( L I N K )\nStay Strong,\nTai Lopez\nw w w . c l i e n t g e n e r a t o r s . c o m\nA D\n#\n2 3\nA short while ago I created a special training program to teach people — step\nby step — how to start their own small agency business. Since launching this\nprogram, it’s helped over 12,000 people.\nIf having your own business sounds intimidating, don’t worry. Many of the\ncurrent members started with little to no social media marketing knowledge\nand are still getting amazing results.\nRecently a small number of people graduated from the program which\nmeans a handful of spots opened up for new members to join.\nIf you’d like an exclusive preview of the program — so you can decide on your\nown if it’s for you — visit this link!\n( L I N K )\nWhen it comes to social media, few people know what they’re talking about. In\nthe program I created, I’m revealing the same strategies I’ve used to grow my\nsocial media to:\n* Over 2 billion minutes of video watched\n* 10+ million followers across my social media networks\n* One of the most-watched video ads of all time\nWhat surprises people about these strategies is they’re easily adaptable —\nfrom dentists or restaurants to fashion brands, pet shops and plumbing\nservices, the training I created helps you get more customers for ANY type of\nbusiness.\nOne of the biggest hurdles I see new entrepreneurs face today is earning their\nfirst 6 figures. The reality is, it’s not that difficult IF you follow this advice one of\nmy first mentors gave me:\nw w w . c l i e n t g e n e r a t o r s . c o m\n“Tai, to figure out where you want to go, break it down into simple steps.”\nThis tip opened my mind to taking any BIG goal and breaking them down into\nmanageable steps I was able to achieve over time.\nFor example, if you want to make 6 figures a year, that's roughly 250 dollars a\nday.\nSo what’s the best way to get started with earning 250/day?\nThere are many ways and all of them, in some way, rely on social media. I\nknow firsthand what’s possible when you recognize — and use — social\nmedia; it’s how I’m able to reach over 200 million people a year.\nMany people are using social media every day, but very few are wise enough\nto earn income with it.\nSmall business owners, for example, are clueless when it comes to using\nsocial media. This is a huge challenge for them because they realize what\nimpact it can have, but lack the time and knowledge to manage it\nthemselves.\nAnd here’s where there’s a huge opportunity.\nYou can become a solution to their problem and, get paid very well as a\nreward.\nBut how?\nLet me give you the big picture — here’s the 3-step process to get small\nbusiness owners to pay you for taking care of their social media:\n1. Learn social media\n2. Use a proven process to get clients\n3. Earn 1-10 grand a month helping small business owners\nIt’s really that simple.\nw w w . c l i e n t g e n e r a t o r s . c o m\nA short while ago I created a free online training that goes through the\nprocess. The free training is designed for people who have zero experience\nstarting a business, getting clients, and no idea where to begin.\nThousands of people have watched the free training and some of them are\nnow making 30k/month with the lessons I showed them. No joke — I had my\nlawyer verify their results to back this up.\nThe free training I created is quick, easy, and explains everything you need to\nget started.

(Affiliates)\nSome Sell Gadgets on FB. (Ecom)\nSome like to play with Google too. (SEO or Blogging)\nWe don’t do any of “that” anymore...\nWe now act as the Bridge between Business Owners and the Leads they so\ndesperately need.\nThis is James, and 2 years ago I ditched my MLM company, my affiliate\naccounts, ecom, SEO and Blogging for the beginning of something special.\nMy partner, Jason and I started something called an “Agency”.\nNow, I know that term isn’t used too much, but it’s the simplest way we can\nexplain:\nHow we help connect business owners to their clients with some simple ads\nand a 2 Page Site.\nNot gonna lie, we both wanted from our business:\n-> Results\n-> Dinero\n-> Freedom\n-> No Competition\nw w w . c l i e n t g e n e r a t o r s . c o m\n-> A Lifestyle Business\n-> Help Others Get Results\n-> Be Paid for making a difference in others’ lives.\nThat required ditching all the old shiny objects we had been “trying”.\nNow all we do is, run small ads to simple 2 page sites for Local Businesses\n(some right down the street from me) on Facebook and Google.\nThese small ads get loads of leads when done properly.\nWe run these small ads for tons of different niches including personal Injury\nlawyers, doctors, dentists, and 24 others we have clients for.\nIn essence, all we're doing is acting as the middleman between their\ncustomers, who don’t know them yet, and the business owners we work with.\nEvery time they get “connected” we collect a nice fee.\nIt’s fun, especially when our business started exploding!\nThe best part is this:\nWe get compensated for actually helping someone.\nNo sales, no slime, just a good ole “internet business model” that has changed\nour lives and EVERY business owner's lives we work with.\nIf curiosity has the best of you, I recorded a free 20 minute video for you that\nexplains in detail how we do this.\nAll you have to do is insert a valid email on the next page.\n( L I N K )\nI will be the first to admit. It all sounds too easy right?\nw w w . c l i e n t g e n e r a t o r s . c o m\nFind a business owner, out of like 23 million, who wants leads, and run small\nads to get them leads?\nThen charge them EVERY SINGLE Month to continue to send them leads?\nAs much as I hate to admit it, I would probably call “bull” on this process if I\nwas reading this on my Facebook Feed.\nAll sounds too good to be true.\nThat is exactly why I shot the no-cost video.\nMainly for proof, but more importantly, you'll see I’m an honest guy. :)\nLet’s say you get past the “Too Good to be True” thought.\nThese are the top 5 questions we always get asked, so might as well be as\ntransparent as I can be:\n[1] Why a valid email?\nI have to get you the video, plus spam is gross so no worries there. However,\nfrom time to time you might witness results of some of our students that we\nget excited to share. You can always just kick us to the curb anytime you\nwant.\n[2] Students? Oh now it makes sense.\nWe do have a paid program for some people who are interested in applying\n(we have had over 10,100 people already apply for it in less than 12 months)\nBUT it’s not required at all. You can apply what you learn in the video without\nneeding to pay for any additional training.\n[3] This concept makes sense but why share it then?\nThere are 23 million local businesses. I doubt our company or the other 1,700\nstudents we have can even come close to helping all of them.\nw w w . c l i e n t g e n e r a t o r s . c o m\n[4] Money, time and skills are lacking. Can I still do this?\nI always use myself as an example. When I started, I had no money, could\nbarely figure out Microsoft Excel, thought Apple computers were way out of\nmy league, and I had a full time job the entire time I was building my agency.\nSo, a little bit of everything goes a long way.\n[5] Clients. How to get clients though?\nWe have a proven 5-layer strategy with over 8 ways to get clients including\nour ‘Leads in Advance’ method. Think about how easy it would be if you gave\nleads to a business owner first, then asked them if they wanted to keep the\nleads coming. Sound like a ‘hard sell’’ or a common sense Yes?\n[6] I’m still nervous!\nGood, you should be. That is why I shot this video to educate you. Skepticism\njust comes from not being informed. The video will fix that.\nIn case you need the link again:\n( L I N K )\nClick, enter, watch…\nSound Good?\nGreat, see you in the video.\nJames\nPS - Right now we have over 1,700 students and hundreds of case studies.\nBut they all started here ---->\n( L I N K )\nWorst case, you get great value and go use the strategies in your own\nbusiness.\nw w w . c l i e n t g e n e r a t o r s . c o m\nA D\n#\n2 5\n“Oh, great.”\n“Some bimbo photoshopped herself into a pool overlooking Hollywood.”\n“Now she’s gonna sell me some BS biz opp.”\n“For just three easy payments of $49.95.”\n“And then, I, too, can live the good life!”\n(*Rolls eyes*)\n(*Makes jerk off motion*)\nEasy, Tiger!\nLook, I get where you’re coming from.\nYou’d rather read a brochure on buttholes than suffer through another\nlong-winded Facebook ad sellin’ you the dream.\nRight?\nSo let’s clear a few things up.\nFIRST:\nThis bimbo has a name.\nIt’s Jessica Samis, from:\n( L I N K )\nw w w . c l i e n t g e n e r a t o r s . c o m\nSECOND:\nThe picture’s real.\nNo, it’s not our pad - Airbnb rental.\nMy husband Jeff and I actually live in Canada, along with our furry lil’ pee\nmachine, Meeko.\nTHIRD:\nThis has nothing to do with network marketing.\nBeen there, done that, got the t-shirt.\nFOURTH:\nNothing to buy.\nNot yet, anyways.\nJust a FREE video training teaching you the one business that always works.\n(As long as *you* do the work.)\nAnd you can get it here:\n( L I N K )\nBut you’ll need to enter a valid email so we know where to send it.\nOkie dokie?\nAnd…\nFINALLY:\nI said this is:\nw w w . c l i e n t g e n e r a t o r s . c o m\n“The one business that always works.”\nI didn’t say it was easy or instant.\nOr that you’d be a millionaire overnight.\nSo, I understand you’re skeptical.\nBut.\nC’mon fam!\nHear me out at least.\n“Okay, so… spit it out then.”\n“What is it?”\n“What’s the ONE business that always works?”\nYou ready for it?\nHere it is:\nIt’s helping other businesses.\n“How?”\nGetting them leads.\n“And how do you do that?”\nLots of ways.\nGoogle, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, etc.\n“So you can do it all online?”\nw w w . c l i e n t g e n e r a t o r s . c o m\nYep, all you need is a laptop.\n“Is it hard to get ‘em leads though?”\nNot when you know what you’re doing.\nWhich is the whole point of this free video training:\n( L I N K )\n“Are you gonna tell me how to get clients in this video?”\nSure am.\nAnd no, you don’t have to be good at sales.\nHonestly, you don’t even hafta leave the house.\nSo slip on your gravy pants, crack a cold one, and get comfy.\nAlright?\n“Now you’re talkin’, Jess!

The same thing is happening to every seller recycling\nthe same outdated strategy.\nSee, Facebook is probably the most well known ads platform on the planet...\nYet, it's also one of the least understood for one reason: it's interruption\nmarketing on a social platform.\nLet me explain...\nThe way you've been taught to use FB Ads is like walking up to a random\nstranger on the street...\nAnd asking them to buy a set of speakers for 50% off out of your trunk.\nEvery once in a while a bargain hunter will take you up on the offer, but for the\nmost part it falls on deaf ears.\nSo what's the answer?\nw w w . c l i e n t g e n e r a t o r s . c o m\nWell it's simple really and you probably discovered it by the time you were 5\nyears old!

The ideas of self empowerment\nand reimagining our relationship to income were so radical I was hooked\nimmediately.\nI looked around at my life and I had done everything that everyone told me to\n- I went to college, I got a job, I worked my 9-5 and partied on the weekend.\nIt sucked.\nEverything popular is wrong.\nOscar Wilde said it, and Tim repackages this argument brilliantly in a way I\ncouldn't ignore.\nFast-forward today, I just reread this book and realized I didn't appreciate this\nidea enough the first time around. In April, I made over $780,000 on Facebook\nAds alone. In 2017, I was featured in Forbes 30 Under 30 and since I first read\nthe book I've been able to building the\n( L I N K )\nentrepreneurial\ncommunity\nnetwork to over 7,000 active members.\nThe popular idea to building a business in 2018 goes something like this:\nGet a nice, expensive website, write a ton of content with researched\nkeywords, build an extensive network of qualified professionals for referral\ndomains and back links, figure out Facebook ads, get a ton of Instagram\nfollowers…\nw w w . c l i e n t g e n e r a t o r s . c o m\nIt keeps going.\nI see this idea everywhere, and it's just wrong.\nThe generalists forages for everything and finds nothing, but the specialist\nwins in their arena more than anyone else. The only thing that matters in the\nmarket is providing real solutions because it provides real value.\nThis idea has helped me reimagine my workweek to a point where I have it\ndown to a science. After reading this book again, I realized I can teach anyone\nelse to do the same - but only if they really want it.\nI put together a free workshop that will show you exactly how I went from\nliving and working out of my parents garage when I first read Tim's book to\nhow I run\n( L I N K )\nfrom my loft & office in Manhattan.\nI will be giving away a free workbook at the end of it that will help you apply\nthe principles you will learn in it directly to your life and you will see 1 single\nonline marketing funnel that has made me over $50,000,000 in sales.\nIf you're ready to go against the grain, sign up here:\n( L I N K )\nw w w . c l i e n t g e n e r a t o r s . c o m\nA D\n#\n3 1\nAs I write this…\nIt's 6pm on Friday here in NYC…\nHow was your week?\nDid you make progress towards your goals?\nOr... Was it more of the same?\nIn life and business, there's no such thing as maintenance. There's no such\nthing as staying where you are.\nStagnation is death. You're either moving forwards or falling backwards.\nIf you're happy stagnating where you are, here's the link for Netflix:\n( L I N K )\nIt'll help you kill the time and numb the reality of your situation.\nBut, if you can't stand staying where you are, and you want to constantly\nimprove and grow…\nI've got something for you.\nSomething that can help you figure out:\n\"What is my purpose, what do I do in this world?\"\nI asked myself the same question 7 years ago.\nI did what every normal kid does and I asked my parents and I asked my\nfriends and their parents and then I asked the career advisor at my school…\nI got pretty much the same advice.\nSomething to this effect:\nw w w . c l i e n t g e n e r a t o r s . c o m\n\"If you want to be successful in life, if you want to be happy, then you should\ngo to school. You should get good grades, then you should go to college, you\nshould get good grades and then you should get a job, a corporate job, and\nthen work your way up the corporate ladder, save your money and then buy a\nhouse, work for 40 years, have a family, then you can retire to a beach\nsomewhere at 65”\nAnd I was like well…\nWho am I to challenge this path?\nThis is what everyone told me, so this must be what you should do.\nSo I went out and I did just that.\nAnd then one day I ended up in this corporate cubicle at this company called\nVodafone back in New Zealand and I thought, is this really it?\nIs this what the rest of my life is going to be, just commuting to and from this\ncage, sitting here clicking on Keynote and Excel.\nHaving meetings where no one's really saying anything, but we just keep\ntalking anyway and you know, drinking a lot of coffee.\nStressing out about work politics and feeling like I had to pretend to be a\ncertain way…\nIt sucked.\nIt got to the point it was so painful I was like…\n“Screw it.

How to pick a niche, how to find your focus, how to find your one thing.\n2. How to become a different person (really)\n3.

Their job is the thing they do so they\ncan have a life - but they spend more time at their job than they do anywhere\nelse.\nIf you ask most businesses why they exist besides making money, they\nprobably won’t even have an answer.\nThe framework society constructed around employment and compensation\nrequires us to trade our time for money under the agreement that the sole\npoint of business is to generate revenue.\nIt’s not just boring - it’s soulless.\nAt the end of this most recent quarter, I took a vacation to Tulum with my wife.\nWhile spending sometime away from the hustle in New York, I took time to\nreflect on what I do and, more importantly, why I do it.\nWhile there, I ran into my student Andrew Argue. Andrew is now one of the\nmost successful accounting consultants in the world and is about to\ntranscend to earning 8 figures annually. He was telling me about when he\nwas in high school and how he lead a movement to change the way the\nschool was operating financially. He now has hundreds of students of his own,\nand we were talking discussing the feedback we get from our clients when he\nsaid something that really stuck with me:\n“I think what the best thing about working with you is that you helped me do\nwhat I truly love doing - and make more money doing it than I could\nanywhere else. And the funny thing is, the thing I hear the most from my\nstudents is that by starting their own consulting firm, they feel like they got\ntheir life back.”\nw w w . c l i e n t g e n e r a t o r s . c o m\nHe then said: “You should really consider opening up that free training again.\nThe 2 hours I spent on that training absolutely changed my life.”\nThe more I thought about it, the more I realized Andrew and I love the same\nthing. We occupy complete different niches, but the true satisfaction we get\nfrom our work comes from the fact that we are in the business of giving\npeople something the corporate 9-5 took from them - freedom.\nI’ve trained thousands of people how to start their own consulting firms, and\n3,217 of them are now completely financially independent and have quit their\njobs.\nWhat I love most about my work is that I am in the business of changing lives.\nI help people create 6 to 7 figure businesses from anywhere in the world - all\nthey need is a laptop and phone. The results are just astonishing, and they\nkeep me working 12 hours a day, 6 days a week, even though I don’t\nnecessarily need to.\nTake Brittany Brown - She started helping people with binge eating and is\nchanging lives and making more than she ever dreamed. She will become a\nmillionaire this year.\nTake Wilkens Ferville - Wilkens knew nothing about digital marketing and was\nworking long hours in a factory. He knew there was something more to life,\nand after joining the program found out that he was actually quite gifted in\necommerce. Now, after making making more than double his yearly salary in\na few months, Wilkens is looking to teach more people how to do what he\ndoes.\nTake Hunter Otis - Hunter was working at a sales job he hated, and when he\nquit his boss laughed at him. Since then, Hunter has gone to help couples fix\ntheir marriage and help men overcome porn addiction. The results are simply\nastonishing - upon hearing what he was doing, his boss got back in contact\nwith him. Fast-forward to today, and his boss now works for him!\nTo put it simply, life is more than money. But money is so important.\nI love my job because it is more than money, but because I set my goals on\ncreating real change, I have made a ton.\nw w w . c l i e n t g e n e r a t o r s . c o m\nWhen I got back to NYC, I realized Andrew was right.\nI’m going to re-open the same free training that helped him, Brittany, and\nHunter.\nI am not going to open this for long - just until space fills.\nIf you’re ready to change your life and become financially independent, it\nstarts with this free training. It’s long and in-depth, but it’s worth it. At the end\nof the training I’ll be offering a free workbook that will help you apply these\nideas to your life immediately.\nIf you’re ready, you can sign up here:\n( L I N K )\nw w w . c l i e n t g e n e r a t o r s . c o m\nA D\n#\n3 3\nI just finished watching Marie Forleo's \"Marie TV\" where she interviews author\nRyan Holliday.\nThey had a phenomenal conversation about the advantage of sacrificing\nimmediate gratification in favor of pursuing the longterm benefit.\nForget about quick wins - go for greatness.\nEverything in the conversation was fascinating, and I highly recommend\nwatching the episode. Marie's insight reminded me of someone - someone\nwho happens to run the richest company in the world.\nWhen I first read Jeff Bezos's 1994 Letter to Shareholders I saw the same\nprinciple that was even communicated similarly to Marie's ideas on her show.\nBezos is probably the best example of longterm thinking the world has ever\nseen - 25 years ago, when Bezos first laid out his vision for Amazon, he set out\non a path that he has literally never wavered from.\nEverything he talks about in the '94 Letters to Shareholders has come fruition\ntwo and a half decades letter. Bezos's obsession with the longterm is evident\nby all the goals he sets out - he completely neglects the quick wins and\nmakes sacrifices in the short term in order to win in the longterm.\nHe never deviated, not for a moment.\nWhen I first set out to be an entrepreneur, I struggled greatly until I mastered\nthis principle, but arrived at its conclusion indirectly.\n5 years ago I was in my parent's garage in New Zealand. My initial journey into\nfinancial independence was frustrating. I kept failing with ideas I thought were\nreally good - and I couldn't understand why.\nUntil one day, it clicked - my ideas were good, they just weren't valuable.\nThe only thing people really care about is true value.\nw w w . c l i e n t g e n e r a t o r s . c o m\nFast-forward to last year, and I made Forbes 30 Under 30 List, I started\n( L I N K )\nand now run it out of our office on Madison Avenue in Manhattan. We also\nhave an office in Ireland, and have helped over 3,000 people become\nfinancially independent in 4 years.\nWhy am I telling you this?\nI want to give value away for free because I believe it is the best longterm\nstrategy for my business.\nIf you're interested in starting your own business and becoming financially\nindependent making 6 figures from anywhere in the world, or if you already\nhave a business and are looking to go to the next level, I put together a free\nworkshop that will show you 3 things:\n1. Pick a niche. The generalist chases everything and gets nothing - but the\nspoils go to the specialist. Find one area you can beat everyone in and you\nwill make more money than you can imagine, and I will teach how to\ngenerate a laser focus capable of hypnotizing your niche and dominating.\n2. Change who you are. I know, that sounds insane. But the reality is that if you\nhad what you needed to be where you wanted to be, then you would already\nbe there. The reality is that business is 50% tactics and 50% mindset, and I will\nexplain in detail how I went from a lazy, insecure wannabe to running a\nbusiness that makes $100k per day. To put it simply - I had to change who I\nwas on a fundamental and instinctive level. Once you do this, your rise to the\nnext level will become effortless.\n3. How to turn a total stranger into a high-paying client paying $2k+ per\nmonth with a 45 minute phone call. I'm going to completely pull the curtain\nback - I'll show you exactly how I run Facebook ads, the funnel I use, the sales\nscript, calendar, everything.\nYou will learn how to convert complete strangers in without any followup, no\ncat and mouse, just one simple 45 minute phone call.\nWhy am I giving this to you for free?\nBecause I trust in the process.\nIf you're ready to start focusing on the long term, go here:\n( L I N K )\nw w w . c l i e n t g e n e r a t o r s . c o m\nA D\n#\n3 4\n\"Those that can't do...teach\"\nAgree or disagree?\nFrom someone who has been on both sides…\n...I say this truthfully.\nI didn't just sit down in front of my computer, and make some stuff up so I\ncould sell it on the internet and retire on a beach.\nThat's what a lot of people do.\nA lot of people make a course or program purely so they can make money.\nThey rush it.

It's a hassle to go to the store to buy makeup. ESPECIALLY if you already know\nwhat you're looking for.\n2. The current system of producer to retailer to customer put a needless step\nin the process. Of course, the retailer marked up the product, and women\nhave to pay more for the product.\nEveryone Jenner knew told her that the market space was too difficult to\nenter, but Jenner was passionate about her project from the beginning.\nThe industry had a problem, and she was going to solve it.\nOnly 3 years later, Jenner has amassed over half a billion in sales and owns\n100% of a company with a ridiculous valuation.\nw w w . c l i e n t g e n e r a t o r s . c o m\nShe ships $29 lip kits she sells directly to the consumer without a retailer in the\nmiddle.\nShe also has eyeshadows, lip liners, and other accessories.\nTo most people it looks like Kylie was just born on top, but the reality is she did\nsomething a lot of successful entrepreneurs have been doing recently.\nIn reality, they create a system to beat the system.\nThey set out to solve a genuine problem and in doing so created a genuine\nadvantage, and then used savvy online marketing to use that advantage and\ndeflate old, bloated companies of the past.\nSurvival of the fittest.\nThe reason I was so impressed with Kylie's tactics and phenomenal success is\nbecause I share the exact same philosophy in my business.\n5 years ago, I was broke, living in my parent's garage without $60k in student\nloan debt I took to go to college I dropped out of.\nJust like people didn't care if they were buying from a \"respected\" brand like\nGillette, I found that people didn't care if I had a fancy website, a large social\nmedia following, or even if I had any clients.\nAll they cared is that I could solve their problem - and they'd happily pay me if\ni could.\nI found a system to beat this system.\nThis system is so powerful I put together a free training that will teach anyone\nhow to become a 6 figure consultant from anywhere in the world.\nDoesn't matter if you have a degree, a website, an existing business, or\nanything.
