Let's dive into the Contacts section of Go High Level. This is where all of your leads, prospects, and clients live. The Contacts tab is your central hub for managing relationships.

CONTACTS TAB OVERVIEW:

When you first open the Contacts tab, you'll see a list view of all your contacts. You can see their name, email, phone number, tags, and when they were last contacted.

The search bar at the top allows you to quickly find any contact by name, email, or phone number. You can also use the filters to segment your contacts based on various criteria.

INDIVIDUAL CONTACT MANAGEMENT:

Click on any contact to open their detailed profile. Here you'll find:

1. Contact Information - Name, email, phone, address, and any custom fields you've created
2. Activity Timeline - Shows all interactions including emails sent, calls made, appointments booked, and form submissions
3. Tasks - Set reminders and to-dos for following up with this contact
4. Appointments - See all scheduled appointments
5. Opportunities - Track deals and sales stages
6. Notes - Add internal notes that only your team can see
7. Files - Upload documents related to this contact
8. Conversations - See all messages across SMS, email, and other channels

The activity timeline is incredibly powerful because it gives you a complete history of every touchpoint with this contact. You can see exactly when they opened an email, clicked a link, or filled out a form.

FILTERS AND SMART LISTS:

Filters are how you segment your database. Click the Filter button to access these options:

- Tags - Filter by one or multiple tags
- Source - Where did they come from? (Facebook, Google, referral, etc.)
- Date Added - When they entered your system
- Last Activity - When was the last interaction
- Custom Fields - Filter by any custom field values
- Opportunity Stage - What stage of your pipeline are they in
- Assigned User - Which team member is responsible

Smart Lists are saved filters that you can reuse. For example, you might create a Smart List for:
- "Hot Leads" - Contacts with high engagement in the last 7 days
- "Stale Opportunities" - Deals that haven't moved in 30 days
- "VIP Clients" - Customers with a specific tag or custom field value

To create a Smart List, set up your filters exactly how you want them, then click "Save as Smart List" and give it a name.

BULK OPERATIONS:

Select multiple contacts using the checkboxes to perform bulk actions:

1. Add/Remove Tags - Tag multiple contacts at once
2. Add to Campaign - Enroll contacts in an automation workflow
3. Add to Pipeline - Create opportunities for multiple contacts
4. Send Email/SMS - Message multiple contacts simultaneously
5. Assign to User - Reassign contacts to different team members
6. Export - Download contact data as CSV
7. Delete - Remove multiple contacts (be careful with this!)

Bulk operations are huge time-savers when you need to manage large groups of contacts.

CREATING PIPELINES:

Pipelines help you visualize and manage your sales process. Click on the Opportunities tab to see your pipelines.

To create a new pipeline:
1. Click "Add Pipeline"
2. Name your pipeline (e.g., "Sales Pipeline", "Client Onboarding", "Partnership Pipeline")
3. Add stages that represent your sales process

For example, a typical sales pipeline might have these stages:
- New Lead
- Contacted
- Qualified
- Proposal Sent
- Negotiation
- Closed Won
- Closed Lost

Each stage should represent a clear step in your process. When a contact moves from one stage to the next, it means they've taken a specific action or you've completed a specific task.

PIPELINE SETTINGS:

For each pipeline, you can configure:

- Stage Names - What are the steps in your process?
- Stage Order - Drag and drop to reorder
- Stage Colors - Visual coding for quick identification
- Automation Triggers - Run workflows when contacts enter specific stages
- Required Custom Fields - Force your team to collect specific information
- Stage Probability - Set the likelihood of closing deals in each stage

The probability feature is great for forecasting revenue. For example:
- New Lead: 10% probability
- Qualified: 25% probability
- Proposal Sent: 50% probability
- Negotiation: 75% probability
- Closed Won: 100% probability

This helps you calculate your pipeline value more accurately.

MANAGING OPPORTUNITIES:

An Opportunity is a potential deal associated with a contact. To create an opportunity:

1. Open a contact's profile
2. Click the Opportunities tab
3. Click "Add Opportunity"
4. Fill in the details:
   - Pipeline (which sales process is this?)
   - Stage (where are they in the process?)
   - Value (how much is this deal worth?)
   - Name (what's the deal called?)
   - Close Date (when do you expect to close?)
   - Assigned User (who's responsible?)

Once created, you can drag opportunities between stages in the pipeline view. This visual representation makes it easy to see:
- How many deals are in each stage
- Total value of all opportunities
- Which deals need attention
- Team member workload distribution

AUTOMATING WITH PIPELINES:

The real power of pipelines comes from automation. You can trigger workflows when:
- A contact enters a pipeline
- A contact moves to a specific stage
- A contact hasn't moved in X days
- An opportunity is won or lost

For example, you might create automations for:

1. New Lead Stage:
   - Send welcome email
   - Assign to sales rep
   - Schedule follow-up task
   - Send SMS introduction

2. Proposal Sent Stage:
   - Wait 3 days
   - Send follow-up email
   - Notify sales manager if no response in 7 days

3. Closed Won Stage:
   - Send onboarding email sequence
   - Create tasks for delivery team
   - Add client to VIP list
   - Request testimonial after 30 days

4. Closed Lost Stage:
   - Add to nurture campaign
   - Schedule re-engagement in 90 days
   - Request feedback on why they didn't buy

CUSTOM FIELDS:

Custom fields allow you to track any information specific to your business. To create custom fields:

1. Go to Settings > Custom Fields
2. Click "Add Custom Field"
3. Choose field type:
   - Text (short answers)
   - Text Area (long answers)
   - Number
   - Date
   - Checkbox
   - Radio (single selection)
   - Dropdown (single selection)
   - Multiple Options (multiple selections)

Examples of useful custom fields:
- Industry
- Company Size
- Budget Range
- Decision Timeline
- Pain Points
- Competition
- Lead Source Details
- Product Interest
- Referral Source

Once created, custom fields appear in contact profiles and can be used for:
- Filtering and segmentation
- Required fields in forms
- Personalization in messages
- Conditional logic in workflows
- Pipeline requirements
- Reporting and analytics

ADVANCED CONTACT MANAGEMENT TIPS:

1. Use Tags Strategically:
   - Create a tagging system that makes sense (e.g., "interest-product-a", "behavior-highly-engaged", "status-customer")
   - Don't over-tag or your system becomes cluttered
   - Use tags that can be automated based on behavior

2. Set Up Smart Lists for Daily Work:
   - "Today's Follow-Ups" - Contacts with tasks due today
   - "Hot Leads Last 7 Days" - Recent high-engagement contacts
   - "Stale Leads" - No activity in 30+ days
   - "Upcoming Appointments" - Appointments in next 48 hours

3. Leverage the Activity Timeline:
   - Review before calling a contact to see their history
   - Use it to identify engagement patterns
   - Find the best time to reach out based on past behavior

4. Duplicate Detection:
   - Go High Level automatically detects potential duplicates
   - Review and merge duplicates regularly to keep your database clean
   - Use email as the primary matching field

5. Contact Scoring:
   - Create a custom field for lead score
   - Use workflows to increase/decrease score based on behavior
   - Filter by score to prioritize outreach

6. Assignment Rules:
   - Set up rules to automatically assign contacts to team members
   - Can be based on: source, location, industry, deal size, etc.
   - Round-robin assignment ensures even distribution

7. Required Fields:
   - Make certain fields required in pipelines to ensure data quality
   - Your team can't move an opportunity forward without filling them in
   - Examples: Budget, Timeline, Decision Maker, Pain Point

PIPELINE BEST PRACTICES:

1. Keep Stages Clear and Actionable:
   - Each stage should represent a specific milestone
   - Team members should know exactly what's required to move to the next stage
   - Avoid vague stages like "In Progress"

2. Use Multiple Pipelines:
   - Sales Pipeline - For new customer acquisition
   - Onboarding Pipeline - For new client setup
   - Renewal Pipeline - For existing customer renewals
   - Partnership Pipeline - For strategic partnerships
   - Each process is different and deserves its own pipeline

3. Set Stage Aging Alerts:
   - Get notified when deals sit in a stage too long
   - Prevents leads from going cold
   - Helps managers identify stuck deals

4. Track Win/Loss Reasons:
   - Add custom fields for why deals close
   - Analyze patterns over time
   - Improve your process based on data

5. Pipeline Reporting:
   - Review pipeline metrics weekly
   - Track: conversion rates, average deal size, time in each stage
   - Identify bottlenecks and optimize

CONTACT LIFECYCLE MANAGEMENT:

Think about the entire customer journey:

1. Lead - Someone who's shown interest
2. Prospect - Qualified and actively being sold to
3. Customer - Purchased your product/service
4. Client - Active ongoing relationship
5. Advocate - Promoting your business to others
6. Churned - No longer a customer

Use tags or custom fields to track these lifecycle stages. Create automations that move contacts through these stages automatically based on their behavior and your interactions.
