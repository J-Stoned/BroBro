you do yeah um I am Molly mahon I am a brand strategist turned funnel builder turned high level lovers slash you know affiliate um I help a lot of people just build out their service based businesses and understand marketing with Soul um and really like thinking about the way you're connecting with your clients differently um I also do a lot of funnel strategy breakdowns funnel Buildout um I teach a lot of my people like how to build websites how to build funnels how to leverage AI um how to use kind of these different chat Bots to supplement your sales and scale your sales in your business um and then I also run a sub account flipping business where we flip um productized sub accounts or snapshot templates and resell them on different marketplaces so yeah I love it lots of stuff always keeping busy and uh yeah always uh love love chatting with you and having you on and uh and always always dropping value bombs so appreciate you uh Paulson what about you man yeah so I've been at high level now for uh it'll be four years in April which is crazy uh time flies when you're having fun right and uh yeah I run the partner Channel and so what that means is like if you're a Tech partner and you have an integration that you're thinking about you're going through the process of building uh you know you've already built it you're going through certification you're listed in the marketplace uh everything involved with that I have my hands in in some way shape or form and so uh the Integrations Marketplace is kind of a big initiative for us this year uh we're we're just trying to get more Integrations in the hands of you know the people who are using our platform and then uh outside of that on kind of my own spare time uh I really I've been in you know the high level Community for a long time uh being at the company and you just see the same questions being asked like over and over and over again and so you know started out creating content just answering those questions and now I've kind of you know niched down in on the AI stuff started building uh voice AI stuff back when it was not cool you know it was like late 2022 early 2023 and uh you know spent 20 Grand learning how to do it and then taught everybody how to do it for like nothing um just so that they can you know skip that that time to learn and all that and then you know now offer a course on kind of all things high level AI which includes the conversational AI the AI appointments bot the workflow AI uh and then also you know chat GPT and all the stuff that ties into high level that way so that's kind of what I spend my time doing that's not related to high level but still related to high level if that makes sense I love it dude yeah and there's I mean there's a lot to unpack there and I feel like you know we could probably spend hours going down different rabbit holes on on the different pieces and components but uh you know before we started uh going live and recording today uh Molly you actually mentioned something interesting around like the the marketing funnel is kind of broken uh and and you know especially as it relates to like Gen Z and kind of the newer generation and the way that they're buying uh can you kind of explain that a little bit more because I'm interested to kind of go down that route yeah 100% so I actually did a a webinar on Friday that broke all of this down but I'll give you guys like the cliff no version um but I I have you know a lot of my Ideal clients are like service-based business owners who lean more on like the holistic side I'd say I'd say for lack of better words they're more like spiritually inclined to like personal development self-help you know not super whoa but they're definitely like more leaning on that side of the coaching Consulting industry um but I am just learning from them how Gen Z is breaking the marketing funnel and I'm seeing it firsthand like actually in my own stuff with like my tick tocks going like semi-viral and stuff like that where like the more content I put out that's not necessarily trying to sell people but just like creating space for people to be inspired and thinking differently about like the way they're consuming information the way they're like doing their marketing their business all of this stuff and just like showcasing thought leadership um I'm getting more people in my world now there's not necessarily a funnel that they're going through like a landing page and opt-in form to like a you know order form like they're not doing that traditional funnel anymore they're finding me on Tick Tock they're falling in love with my content they're binge watching it they're immediately going to my profile clicking on my Instagram so they can like check out my feed to like get a vibe for like what I'm about they're immediately clicking the link in bio they're going to my website they're you know scrolling through my website they're seeing what offers I have again not buying yet they're going to the blogs they're reading the Blog signing up for the email list now they're on my email list now they're getting my nurture sequences now they're going back and clicking through on those emails back to like a landing page and a sales page and now they're buying they also might not buy from me like right away they might just start following me and engaging in my content commenting back and forth private messaging me asking me questions and then maybe like three to six months down the road like and now they're ready to buy and so what I'm noticing is it's like this they're calling it infinite Loop marketing where it's not like a funnel it's like it's like the infinity symbol where it's just this like figure eight and they're going through this like Inspire like inspiration phase where they're learning about you you're creating all this free content they're seeing your thought leadership they're getting inspired and they're like oh like I could see myself working with this person or like oh like this person's really inspiring like I want to learn from them then they like go into an exploration phase where they're exploring everything in your world they're going on your website they're reading your blogs they're like searching like what is this person all about then they want to join a community somehow so whether that's like a free Facebook group or a free you know uh Discord Community or you know now you can like follow people on Instagram like subscribe to someone's profile like they want to like join your community in some way and like feel like they're a part of something and so they're like you know diving deeper into your content and like really like actually building a relationship with you in a way and then there's like a loyalty phase where they're like they've either bought from you or they're like about to buy from you and they're just super loyal to you they love you and they just want to keep like buying your products and so what I'm realizing this is like really really imperative for agency owners to understand because you need to like understand how your clients are going to be buying from you and so for if your clients are going to be you know in the e-com space or they're targeting like a millennial or you know Gen X like the funnel still works like the traditional funnel where it's a landing page sales page check out like they're gonna they're gonna opt in they're going to go on a nurture sequence they're gonna get sold they're gonna buy the thing but if your ideal clients are Gen Z or if you have clients who their ideal clients are Jen GenZy you need to start thinking of how you're marketing to them differently because they're not going to convert on some like half-assed landing page with like a lead magnet and like a little nurture sequence like they're they're not buying that way anymore and so this is where you need to have like a really robust like content plan you need to have like a really robust like nurture campaign you need to have really good website copy you need to have really interesting blogs that are like keyword optimized so that people can come and find you from Google you need to have like membership communities where people feel like they're a part of something and so it's like they're looking at all of your social platforms first they want to find you on social they want to find out what you're about they're not going to necessarily just like land on a landing page and immediately buy like maybe there's like a super small percentage of people who will still do that but like for the most part people need more touch points now to buy than they used to before and this is where like AI employees and chat Bots and automation can come and like support you because it's like if you think about it one chat bot could be like 50 different employees of like managing and answering questions and you know sending people all these different things and nurturing people and putting people in the right buckets and stuff like that so yeah it's like it's a whole it's a whole thing this is like a whole rabbit hole I could go down but I love it I mean that that like that all resonates so so deeply and I think you're totally right I mean it's you know it's it's interesting to think about too like even you know when I when I think about my purchase Behavior even just like the last couple years like you're totally right like it's not like I see an ad and I immediately buy something like I might see an ad and then I'm gonna go search who you are and like read about you and go down these different like I'm gonna try and basically like consume as much as I can about your brand the person like everything to like essentially get a feel for it and then maybe eventually you know if I'm compelled enough I'll make the purchase um and so so yeah so that's I think that's really interesting and so so like like how do you so so that like when you work with with clients and like how do you so obviously like creating content like that seems like pillar number one right like like obviously like having some sort of like content engine of sorts to where you're putting out consistent you know free content building building that brand that thought leadership all that sort of stuff like that seems like piece number one um and then yeah like just kind of filling in all those other those other pieces and having the website the blogs like all that sort of stuff to yeah yeah pretty much like you need to have some kind of content engine and like you need to be putting out content that's going to be that people can find you you know what I mean like there needs to be some kind of search um you know situation going on whether you're doing like heavy keyword like you know search engine optimization on your website so people can find you on Google whether you're doing um you know hashtag and keyword optimization on your Instagram post so people can find you through like you know searching on Instagram whether you're leveraging tick tock and you're like hoping to go viral whether you're like paying for ads so people find you through Facebook you know what I mean in some way people need to be able to find you you need to be putting out content there needs to be enough of a touch Point through all of your you know whether that's through automation whether that's through social media whether that's through you know different Pages or blogs that you're putting out there there needs to be touch points throughout the buyers Journey for them to decide okay yeah I'm ready to buy because they just need so much more now people are less trustworthy now than they were before you know what I mean scams are more common like especially with AI it's like you can't really trust anything anymore because you know voices are being cloned people are making videos with AI like people just don't really know what to trust anymore so they're really taking a lot more time to like vet who they want to work with and buy from and that's where a lot of this comes in too yeah that totally makes sense I mean it's it's you have to do it you have to play on all the different you know all the different areas I mean possum I'm curious from from your perspective like yeah like how does this how does this kind of resonate and I know like you do a lot of content stuff too yeah I think that uh like it's interesting because a lot of what you were talking about Molly I think is what we've seen and I I would say what high level has done as a company you know if I think back to like our viral conversation bot snapshot from like October of 2023 which seems like forever ago at this point um you know we we the the platform the company we really shifted from trying to run ads and get people scheduled on sales calls to like how do we create really compelling free stuff that people are just going to want to share and like sure do we generate a bunch of leads from that that end up not converting sure but we also generate a whole bunch of people that fall into that like inspiration phase where they see what we're doing and they're like oh man this is really cool or we get people in the exploration phase where it's like oh I'm going to try this snapshot out now I'm gonna like poke around in the trial account and see like kind of what's what's here and what can I do with this you know I think what you were talking about Molly and one of the things you touched on there is like all of the different like channels and I think like what I'm what I've built my content on is like I want to be the type of person that like people can find me wherever they're consuming content and so I've got the YouTube channel that does really well because there's a lot of search there um I have a podcast so if you want to like listen while you're you know driving to work or doing the dishes or whatever you can do that um Instagram you know I post I post at least once a day sometimes multiple times a day on Instagram um a lot of times I'll share reels and stuff like that and then I've got my email list and people can like subscribe to that and so it's like because to your point like everybody consumes content in a different way and the more touch points that you can give them uh the better and so I think for agencies especially like if you're looking at building an audience of clients um one one piece of advice I would give you know everyone listening is like pick one like pick one main thing whether it's a podcast whether it's YouTube whether it's Instagram like pick one thing and be super consistent there and then start to like branch out from that so like okay if I'm going all in on Instagram like okay then I'm gonna post an Instagram every day um cool you know you start doing that for a few months and you build a little bit of momentum now you can take some of those reels and you can post them as YouTube shorts now you can take some of those you know um posts and you can send them out in an email newsletter now you can you know it all kind of can be repurposed and reused and so you don't have to like create brand new content for each platform that you're going on um but you can kind of show up on all of these platforms where people are hanging out and consuming content in different ways um and I think that's a that's a shift that you know like to your point the the funnel isn't dead but like it's it's shifted and it's changed and I think that all plays a big role in it yeah I love that and I think yeah the the concept of like picking one right like committing to one platform and like building out that engine there and getting that consistent right and the keyword there is consistent it's like you got to actually like do it every single day or at least you know X number times per week and actually like commit to it um and then once you get that down then you can then like you said start to Branch out and repurpose and do all that sort of stuff uh and I think that's I think that's huge and and so okay so obviously like content super super important and I think you know yeah regardless like you got to be doing that in in some way um and so then then that kind of brings in the next question which is like okay so like as somebody who's like kind of going on this journey right like they've got okay we're gonna build the content engine out we've you know depending on where you're at maybe you've got some some people coming in or you're starting to get a little bit of traction like whatever that is and so then like at what point does like the AI stuff come into play right because obviously like you know I know that's something that both of you uh utilize and and you know teach and consult on and all that um and so I'm curious like yeah like how does that how does that all kind of work together I think like I mean I can jump in here the way that I see it is like AI helps you be consistent without burning out right and so like what like when you're first getting started when you're a solopreneur and you're trying to do all this stuff yourself yeah you can be consistent for you know a few days a few weeks maybe a few months if you're really disciplined but are you going to be consistent for years doing all of that yourself probably not because you're going to get burnt out or you're gonna have to hire a team to help you do some of that stuff and so like if I think about the way that I use AI to make my life easier one is idea generation right so like I use chat GPT to come up with like content buckets okay I'm gonna talk about this this week I'm gonna talk about this next week right that's one thing then I also use it to help me actually write the content so like okay here's a video I recorded uh I'll take the transcript of that throw it into chat GPT have a script write me you know a newsletter based on this have a write me you know a couple of Instagram post ideas based on this topic that I talked about in the video uh I can have it write me a couple tweets based on you know this topic in the video and so on and so forth right so it helps me create or repurpose content now the next thing that it helps me do is respond to comments and DMS right so you know if somebody sends me a message on Instagram like I could use the conversational AI feature to like have it man my Instagram DMS and respond to people on my behalf now it's not going to be perfect and you definitely want to you know check those messages and stuff but like it can handle a lot of that inbound for me so I can focus on creating more content or serving my customers right uh and so like when I think about like where AI fits in one it helps you be more consistent two it helps you create more content and then three it helps you actually you know handle the the stuff that comes in as a result and even on the sales side too right so like okay cool I got a bunch of people on my email list I got a bunch of people following me on social like but now what now how do I get them to buy and so you know you've got ai
