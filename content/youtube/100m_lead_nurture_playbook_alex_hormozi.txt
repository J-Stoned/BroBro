$100M PLAYBOOK: LEAD NURTURE - How to Get More Leads to Respond, Schedule, and Show
By Alex Hormozi

INTRODUCTION: THE ALAN STORY

During COVID, we had a problem. Our sales team couldn't handle the lead volume we were generating. So we built ALAN (Artificial Lead Automation & Nurture) - a software solution that automated our lead nurture process.

The results were staggering. We analyzed over 4,000 appointments per day across our portfolio companies and discovered four key drivers that determined whether leads would respond, schedule, and most importantly - show up.

Because if they do not show, they cannot buy.

This playbook breaks down those four pillars and gives you the exact framework we used to increase show rates by 20-40% across our companies.

THE BIG IDEA: LEAD NURTURE

Lead nurture is the process of getting leads to:
1. Respond to your outreach
2. Schedule an appointment
3. Show up to that appointment

Most businesses lose 50-80% of their leads in this gap between lead generation and actual sales conversation. They spend thousands on ads, get tons of leads, but never convert them because they fail at lead nurture.

The math is simple: If you double your show rate, you double your revenue (assuming everything else stays constant).

Most people think the problem is lead quality. It's not. It's lead nurture.

THE FOUR PILLARS OF LEAD NURTURE

After analyzing millions of dollars in ad spend and thousands of appointments, we discovered four key drivers of lead nurture success:

PILLAR I: AVAILABILITY
PILLAR II: SPEED
PILLAR III: PERSONALIZATION
PILLAR IV: VOLUME

Master these four pillars and you'll dramatically increase the number of leads that turn into customers.

---

PILLAR I: AVAILABILITY

The Big Idea: The more available you are, the higher your show rates.

THE PROBLEM:
Most businesses make it hard to schedule. They offer limited time slots, business hours only, or make you jump through hoops to book. Every friction point costs you customers.

THE DATA:
We tracked appointments across our portfolio and found a direct correlation:
- Businesses with 24/7 scheduling: 40-50% show rates
- Businesses with business hours only: 20-30% show rates
- Businesses with "call to schedule": 10-15% show rates

THE SOLUTION:
Make yourself as available as possible:

1. OFFER MORE TIME SLOTS
   - Open your calendar wide
   - Evenings and weekends matter
   - The lead wants to meet when THEY'RE available, not when you are

2. USE AUTOMATED SCHEDULING
   - Calendar links remove friction
   - No phone tag
   - Instant confirmation
   - They can book at 2am if they want

3. BOOK OUT FURTHER
   - Don't limit to "next 7 days only"
   - Some people need to plan ahead
   - You want the appointment, even if it's 3 weeks out

4. REDUCE QUALIFICATION REQUIREMENTS
   - Don't make them "qualify" before booking
   - Get them scheduled first, qualify on the call
   - Every question before scheduling reduces show rates

THE AVAILABILITY CHECKLIST:
☐ Calendar link is easy to find and use
☐ Time slots available 7 days per week
☐ Evening appointments available
☐ Can book out at least 2-3 weeks
☐ No unnecessary qualification questions before scheduling
☐ Automated confirmation sent immediately

THE COUNTER-ARGUMENT:
"But Alex, won't this fill my calendar with unqualified leads?"

Maybe. But would you rather have:
- A calendar full of appointments with a 40% show rate
- An empty calendar with only "qualified" leads

Remember: They can't buy if they don't show. Get them scheduled first.

THE REAL WORLD EXAMPLE:
One of our fitness companies was only offering appointments during business hours (9am-5pm weekdays). Their show rate was 23%.

We opened up their calendar:
- Added evening slots (5pm-8pm)
- Added Saturday appointments
- Pushed their calendar out from 1 week to 3 weeks

Show rate jumped to 41% in the first month. Same leads, same ad spend, same everything else. Just more availability.

---

PILLAR II: SPEED

The Big Idea: The faster you contact and schedule a lead, the higher your show rate.

THE PROBLEM:
Leads go cold fast. Every minute you wait, they're getting calls from your competitors, reconsidering their decision, or just forgetting they even filled out your form.

THE DATA:
We analyzed contact speed across thousands of leads:
- Contact within 5 minutes: 60% contact rate, 35% schedule rate
- Contact within 1 hour: 40% contact rate, 20% schedule rate
- Contact within 24 hours: 20% contact rate, 10% schedule rate
- Contact after 24 hours: 10% contact rate, 5% schedule rate

The pattern is clear: Speed wins.

THE TWO SPEED METRICS THAT MATTER:

1. SPEED TO FIRST CONTACT
   Goal: Contact within 5 minutes of lead coming in

   How to achieve it:
   - Automated SMS/email immediately on form submission
   - Auto-dialer for sales team (lead rings their phone within 60 seconds)
   - 24/7 coverage (nights/weekends matter)

   What to say in first contact:
   "Hey [Name], I saw you just requested info about [thing]. I've got your info pulled up. Do you have 2 minutes to chat right now or should I send you a calendar link?"

   The goal is immediate response while they're still hot.

2. SPEED TO SCHEDULED APPOINTMENT
   Goal: Get them scheduled within 72 hours of first contact

   Why 72 hours?
   - After 3 days, show rates drop dramatically
   - Life gets in the way
   - They forget why they were interested
   - Competitors get to them

   How to achieve it:
   - Offer same-day or next-day appointments
   - Use urgency ("I have one spot left today at 4pm")
   - Make scheduling the call-to-action of every touchpoint

THE SPEED STACK:
Best practices for maximum speed:

Minute 0: Lead fills form
Minute 1: Automated SMS sent ("Got your info! Calling you now...")
Minute 1: Automated email sent (with calendar link)
Minute 2: Sales rep calls (auto-dialer)
Minute 5: If no answer, automated voicemail drop + follow-up SMS
Minute 15: Second call attempt
Hour 1: Third call attempt + email
Hour 4: Fourth call attempt
Day 1: Fifth call attempt + SMS
Day 2: Sixth call attempt
Day 3: Seventh call attempt + "final attempt" messaging

THE COUNTER-ARGUMENT:
"But Alex, won't calling within 1 minute seem desperate or pushy?"

No. It seems professional and responsive. The lead just asked for your help. Helping them immediately is good service, not desperation.

Think about it: If you filled out a form to buy something, would you be annoyed if someone called you right away to help? No. You'd be impressed.

THE REAL WORLD EXAMPLE:
One of our service companies was taking an average of 4 hours to contact new leads. Their schedule rate was 18%.

We implemented:
- Instant SMS automation
- Auto-dialer for sales team
- Shift coverage for after-hours leads

Average contact time dropped to 8 minutes. Schedule rate jumped to 31%.

Same leads. Same offer. Just faster.

PILLAR III: PERSONALIZATION

The Big Idea: Personalized outreach gets higher response rates, schedule rates, and show rates.

THE PROBLEM:
Generic messages get ignored. When a lead sees "Hi there!" or "Dear Customer," they know it's automated and they tune out.

But when they see their name, their specific situation referenced, and messaging that speaks to THEIR needs - they pay attention.

THE DATA:
We split-tested personalized vs generic messaging across our portfolio:

Generic: "Hi! Thanks for your interest. Click here to schedule."
- 12% response rate
- 8% schedule rate
- 22% show rate

Personalized: "Hi Sarah! I saw you were interested in losing 20lbs before your wedding in June. I've helped 3 other brides do exactly that. Here's a link to chat: [link]"
- 34% response rate
- 23% schedule rate
- 41% show rate

Same leads. Same offer. Different messaging.

THE THREE LEVELS OF PERSONALIZATION:

LEVEL 1: BASIC PERSONALIZATION
- Use their first name
- Reference what they opted in for
- Mention their city/location if relevant

Example: "Hi John, I saw you requested info about our plumbing services in Austin."

LEVEL 2: QUALIFICATION-BASED PERSONALIZATION
- Segment based on how they found you
- Segment based on what they're looking for
- Segment based on their timeline/urgency

Example: "Hi Sarah, I saw you're looking to sell your house in the next 30 days. I've helped 15 other homeowners in Riverside close fast. Here's what we can do..."

LEVEL 3: DEEP PERSONALIZATION
- Reference specific pain points they mentioned
- Use language that matches their sophistication level
- Show you've done research on their situation

Example: "Hi Mike, I saw you mentioned you've tried 3 other agencies but haven't seen results. I looked at your website and immediately spotted 5 things that are killing your conversions. Want me to show you?"

THE PERSONALIZATION STACK:

1. COLLECT THE RIGHT DATA
   In your lead form, ask:
   - Name (first name minimum)
   - Specific goal/problem
   - Timeline/urgency
   - What they've tried before

   Don't ask more than 3-5 questions or form abandonment goes up.

2. SEGMENT YOUR MESSAGING
   Create different message templates for:
   - Different lead sources (Google vs Facebook vs referral)
   - Different goals/problems
   - Different urgency levels (need help now vs just browsing)

   Use conditional logic to send the right message to the right person.

3. PERSONALIZE AT SCALE
   You can't manually personalize every message to every lead. Use:
   - Dynamic fields (name, goal, city, etc.)
   - Conditional content blocks
   - AI to help draft personalized messages
   - Templates that SOUND personal even when automated

THE COUNTER-ARGUMENT:
"But Alex, personalizing every message takes forever!"

You're not personalizing from scratch every time. You're building templates with dynamic fields and conditional logic.

Example template:
"Hi {{first_name}}, I saw you were interested in {{goal}}. I've helped {{number}} other {{avatar_type}} do exactly that. Here's how: {{link}}"

That template can generate thousands of unique, personalized messages.

THE REAL WORLD EXAMPLE:
One of our coaching companies was sending the same generic message to every lead: "Thanks for your interest! Click here to schedule: [link]"

We created 5 different message templates based on:
- What program they inquired about
- What they said their biggest challenge was
- How they found us

Each message referenced their specific situation and spoke directly to their pain point.

Response rate went from 15% to 38%. Show rate went from 25% to 44%.

Same leads. Same offer. Just personalized messaging.

PILLAR IV: VOLUME

The Big Idea: The more times you reach out, the higher your response rate.

THE PROBLEM:
Most businesses give up too soon. They call once, maybe twice, send an email, and then mark the lead as "dead."

But the data shows: Most leads don't respond until the 6th, 7th, or 8th attempt.

THE DATA:
We tracked response rates by attempt number across thousands of leads:

Attempt 1: 15% respond
Attempt 2: 8% respond
Attempt 3: 6% respond
Attempt 4: 5% respond
Attempt 5: 4% respond
Attempt 6: 4% respond
Attempt 7: 3% respond
Attempts 8-12: 2% each

Cumulative response rate:
- After 1 attempt: 15%
- After 3 attempts: 29%
- After 7 attempts: 45%
- After 12 attempts: 55%

If you stop at 3 attempts, you're leaving 26% of your leads on the table.

THE VOLUME FRAMEWORK:

1. THE 7+ RULE
   Reach out at least 7 times before marking a lead as unresponsive.

   Why 7?
   - Most people need multiple touches
   - They're busy and miss messages
   - Persistence shows you actually care

   Mix up your channels:
   - Call
   - SMS
   - Email
   - Voicemail
   - Social media DM (if appropriate)

2. THE SPACING STRATEGY
   Don't just spam them. Space out your attempts strategically:

   Day 1: Attempt 1, 2, 3 (within first few hours)
   Day 2: Attempt 4
   Day 3: Attempt 5
   Day 5: Attempt 6
   Day 7: Attempt 7
   Day 14: Attempt 8
   Day 30: Final attempt

   Early attempts are rapid (strike while hot). Later attempts are spaced out.

3. THE MESSAGE VARIATION
   Don't send the same message 7 times. Vary your approach:

   Attempt 1-2: Enthusiastic, helpful ("Just saw your request!")
   Attempt 3-4: Value-driven ("Here's a quick tip...")
   Attempt 5-6: Empathetic ("I know you're busy...")
   Attempt 7+: Last chance ("This is my final attempt to reach you...")

4. THE AUTOMATION + HUMAN MIX
   Best results come from combining:
   - Automated messages (speed, consistency)
   - Human follow-up (personalization, relationship)

   Example flow:
   - Automated: Instant SMS
   - Human: Call within 5 min
   - Automated: Email with calendar link
   - Human: Second call
   - Automated: Reminder SMS
   - Human: Third call
   - Automated: Final email sequence

THE PRE-APPOINTMENT REMINDER SEQUENCE:

Once they schedule, don't stop. They still might not show.

Send reminders:
- Immediately after booking (confirmation)
- 1 day before (reminder)
- 3 hours before (final reminder)
- 15 minutes before (you're on soon!)

Each reminder should:
- Confirm the date/time
- Include calendar link to reschedule if needed
- Build excitement/value for the call
- Make it easy to show up (Zoom link, address, etc.)

THE COUNTER-ARGUMENT:
"But Alex, won't I annoy people by reaching out 7+ times?"

Maybe 5% of people will be annoyed. 95% either won't notice or will appreciate the persistence.

And here's the thing: The people who get annoyed weren't going to buy anyway.

The people who DO buy will say "Thanks for following up, I almost forgot!"

THE REAL WORLD EXAMPLE:
One of our software companies was doing 3 attempts and then giving up. They were reaching about 30% of their leads.

We extended to 12 attempts over 30 days with:
- Mixed channels (call, SMS, email)
- Varied messaging
- Automation + human touches

They started reaching 58% of their leads. Almost double. Same leads, just more volume.

EXECUTION: DOING THE BORING WORK

The four pillars work. The data proves it. But most people won't do them.

Why?

Because lead nurture is boring, repetitive work. It's not sexy. It's not exciting.

It's calling the same lead 7 times.
It's sending the same message 1,000 times.
It's setting up automations and testing and tweaking.

Most entrepreneurs want to focus on the "big picture" strategy stuff. They don't want to grind through lead nurture.

But here's the truth: Volume negates luck.

THE JACOB STORY:

When we started Gym Launch, we had a sales guy named Jacob. He wasn't the smoothest talker. He wasn't the most charismatic. He didn't have a sales background.

But Jacob did one thing better than everyone else: He did the boring work.

While other sales reps would call a lead 2-3 times and give up, Jacob would call 10+ times.
While others would send a generic email, Jacob would research the prospect and personalize.
While others would leave basic voicemails, Jacob would leave value-driven messages.

Within 3 months, Jacob was our top sales rep. Not because he was the most talented. Because he did the boring work nobody else wanted to do.

The lesson: You don't need to be the best. You just need to do more of the right things.

THE CULTURE OF LEAD NURTURE:

If you're leading a sales team, you need to create a culture around lead nurture.

1. TRACK THE METRICS
   What gets measured gets managed:
   - Speed to first contact
   - Number of attempts per lead
   - Response rate by attempt
   - Schedule rate
   - Show rate

   Put these on a dashboard everyone can see.

2. CELEBRATE THE BORING WORK
   Don't just celebrate closed deals. Celebrate:
   - Fastest contact time
   - Most attempts on a lead that eventually booked
   - Best show rate improvement

   Make the boring work heroic.

3. SYSTEMIZE EVERYTHING
   The only way to consistently execute on lead nurture is to systemize it:
   - Automated sequences
   - Scripts and templates
   - SOPs for each step
   - Technology that does the heavy lifting

   Don't rely on people to remember. Build systems that ensure it happens.

LEAD NURTURE IS A REVENUE MULTIPLIER:

Here's the beautiful thing about lead nurture: It multiplies everything else you're doing.

If you're spending $10,000/month on ads and getting 100 leads...

At a 20% show rate, you get 20 appointments.
At a 40% show rate, you get 40 appointments.

Same ad spend. Double the appointments.

If your close rate is 25%, you go from 5 customers to 10 customers.
If your average customer value is $5,000, you go from $25,000 to $50,000 in revenue.

All from lead nurture.

Most businesses try to solve their revenue problem by spending more on ads. But if you're losing 80% of your leads to bad nurture, you're just pouring water into a leaky bucket.

Fix the leak first. Then add more water.

3. Be personal
4. Be persistent

Do those four things better than your competition, and you'll win.

Remember: If they do not show, they cannot buy.

Get them to show.
