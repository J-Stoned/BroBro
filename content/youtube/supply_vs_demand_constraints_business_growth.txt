SUPPLY VS DEMAND CONSTRAINTS - How to Identify and Fix the Real Problem Holding Your Business Back

TRANSCRIPT:

I'm going to show you how to grow your business so fast this year that it makes your accountant nervous. And maybe you're not growing as fast as you want right now. And it's probably because you're trying to fix a problem that might not actually exist. And so most businesses have one of two core problems and they don't know which one they have. And so I'm going to show you how to identify which one of the two you have and how to fix it.

I'm Alex Hormozi. I own acquisition.com a portfolio of companies that generate north of 200 plus million a year as of 2024. So whenever I look at a business, I always want to understand this one triage question up front, which is, is this a business that is supply constrained or is this a business that's demand constrained?

THE BIG IDEA:

You can either have too few customers or too little capacity, but never both at the same time.

DEFINITIONS:

Demand Problem:
- You have space but not enough customers
- Restaurant with empty tables
- Calendar with open slots
- Product sitting on shelves
- You built it but people aren't coming

Supply Problem:
- You have customers but not enough capacity
- Waiting lists
- Have to turn people away
- Can't make products fast enough
- Can't take on new clients
- They're coming in but you can't serve them all

THE SIMPLE TEST:

If you doubled your ad budget tomorrow or you doubled your outreach or you doubled your content, would you be able to double your sales or would you just create a mess that you couldn't even handle?

- If it creates a mess = Supply problem
- If it would double your sales = Demand problem

The difference between businesses that grow and those that don't isn't just hard work, but it's working hard on the right problem. As Warren Buffett says, there's nothing worse than doing well with something that shouldn't be done at all.

CASE STUDY #1: THE FULLY BOOKED CONSULTANT

Situation:
- Completely booked 3 months ahead
- Working 60 hours a week
- Always stressed out
- Income has stopped growing
- Making more content, running more ads, trying to get more leads

Problem: Trying to fix a demand problem that doesn't exist. This is a SUPPLY constraint (also potentially a pricing problem).

Three Solutions:

1. Raise Prices Significantly (50-100% increases, not 25 cents)
   - Expect ~30% of clients to leave
   - But if you doubled prices and lost 30%, you make MORE money with FEWER clients
   - Double benefit: More revenue + freed up time
   - Use freed time to create more capacity

2. Change Service-to-Delivery Ratio
   - Move from one-on-one to one-to-many
   - Move from one-on-one to small group coaching
   - Keeps same time commitment but serves more people

3. Hire and Train Other Consultants
   - Keep ratio the same
   - Add more headcount to business
   - Scale through people

Result: Could double income working 15 fewer hours per week, then double it again after bringing in leverage.

Key Lesson: Sometimes the path to growth isn't more clients, it might be better clients.

CASE STUDY #2: THE SOFTWARE COMPANY

Situation:
- Helps service businesses schedule appointments
- CEO proudly shows off new features
- "Our product's going to be the best"
- People who try it love it
- Customers stay a long time
- Product works great
- Still not growing

Problem: DEMAND constrained
- Spending only 5% of revenue on marketing
- Competitors spending 20-30%
- Built a great product but nobody knows it exists
- Fighting against irrelevance

Solution: Reallocate resources from product to marketing
- Currently have no churn (no one leaving)
- Product is good enough
- Need to let more people know about it
- Stop adding features, start getting customers

Important Caveat on Product vs Marketing:
- Product quality matters for word-of-mouth IF customers have high surface area exposure to other potential customers
- Facebook works because users talk to other people daily
- B2B Fortune 100 IT consulting won't get viral growth
- The more niche and high-end you are, the more you'll need to actively acquire customers
- Good product reduces churn but doesn't necessarily drive growth

Key Insight: Often products get worse through addition. Sometimes best improvement is deleting things. Sometimes best years are when founder isn't "involved" because team just gets naturally better without constant change.

CASE STUDY #3: THE RESTAURANT WITH WEEKEND LINES

Situation:
- 2-hour waits on Saturday
- Empty on Tuesday afternoon
- Same business, different problems at different times
- Spending thousands on ads every month
- More marketing just creates more angry people who can't get in on weekends

Problem: MISPRICED - Both supply AND demand constraint at different times
- Supply constrained on weekends (Friday/Saturday)
- Demand constrained on weekdays
- Enough capacity but not allocated to right times

Three Solutions:

1. Raise Prices on Friday/Saturday (Weekend Premium Pricing)
   - Different menu for weekends vs weekdays
   - 20% price increase on 10% margin business = 3x profit on those days
   - If weekends are 50% of revenue, this 1.5x's total business profit
   - Side effect: Some customers spread to weekdays to avoid premium

2. Let People Pay to Skip the Line
   - Doesn't solve constraint but makes more money
   - Premium pricing for guaranteed seating

3. Stay Open Later
   - If you close at 9pm but still have lines, close at 11pm
   - Utilize existing capacity better

Combined Effect: 100%+ increase in profit from three small changes

Pro Tip on Framing:
- People hate price increases
- Don't say "weekends are 20% more"
- Say "weekdays are 20% less" (discount framing)
- Same economics, better psychology

CASE STUDY #4: ONLINE FITNESS EQUIPMENT STORE DURING COVID

Situation:
- Home workout boom during COVID
- Sales go up 4x overnight
- Sell out of everything
- Suppliers can't keep up
- Keep running ads and marketing
- "Let's ride this wave, let's pre-sell"

Result:
- Shipping times go from 2 weeks to 8 weeks
- Bad reviews pour in
- Customer service swamped
- Making problem worse with each sale
- Not fixing the real issue

Problem: SUPPLY constrained (physical product)

Two Core Solutions:

1. Sell Something Different (Generate Cash for Supply Chain)
   - Sell intangible products (no supply constraint)
   - Warranty programs to existing customers
   - White label fitness apps (tap someone else's supply)
   - Affiliate deals with complementary products
   - Insurance products (no supply)
   - Related services (gym flooring, design, decoration)
   - Generate cash to pay vendors premium to jump the line

2. Increase Supply
   - Pay vendors 20% more to get front of line
   - Money talks - you CAN pay to skip vendor queues
   - Invest in supply chain infrastructure
   - Multiple vendors (eliminate single points of failure)
   - Redundancies in the system

Key Lesson: If you're in physical products business and you have great product or you're good at marketing, supply chain WILL become the constraint. Supply chain mastery is core competency.

Note: One-time or short-term cash generation plays are acceptable in crisis situations rather than starting whole new business lines. Focus on quick wins that don't require much work (introduce to existing base, take split, reinvest in core constraint).

CASE STUDY #5: THE HOME SERVICES PLUMBER

Situation:
- Running Google PPC
- Every slot booked in calendar
- Vans always on the road
- Technicians working overtime
- Paying time and a half
- Profits compressing
- Fully booked but not profitable

Owner Thinks: Need more customers OR more technicians

Real Problem: DEMAND constrained (specifically sales skills supply problem)
- Plumbers finish jobs quickly
- Rarely offer additional services or upgrades
- Not selling membership programs
- Not creating repair schedules for return visits
- Not checking other units in the house
- Not maximizing revenue per customer visit

Solution: Teach Simple Sales Skills
- Sales skills are the actual supply constraint
- Give 2-3 line scripts
- "Once you finish this, ask them if they want this"
- Role play every morning at team meeting
- Track upsell percentage
- If 50% upsell to another job = 50% revenue increase
- Disproportionate profit increase (costs stay similar)

Key Insight: Most businesses in established industries running paper-thin margins are missing a core part of the business. They do step one but not step two. Step two is where all the profit is.

Important: Sometimes best move isn't getting more customers, it's making more from the customers you've got.

Rock and Hard Place Scenarios:
- "I can't grow enough but I can't spend money to grow"
- "I need help but need money to buy the help"
- "If I had more customers I could afford it, but I can't serve more customers"
- Two-thirds of businesses have been at same revenue for 2+ years
- It's solvable

CASE STUDY #6: ENTERPRISE COMMERCIAL BUILDING SOFTWARE

Situation:
- Stuck at same revenue for 8 YEARS
- Can't crack the revenue ceiling
- Outbound method to commercial buildings
- 10 demonstrations per week
- Closing 2 deals per YEAR
- 2 out of 500 demos = 0.4% close rate
- 98% revenue retention (no one ever leaves)

Owner Thinks: Need to hire more salespeople, double the team

Real Problem: DEMAND constrained but the issue is SALES PROCESS
- Not the number of reachouts
- Not the messaging
- Not even number of demos
- Can't close - closing 2 out of 500

Solution: Don't double sales team - fix the close rate
- 50x opportunity if 500 demos turn into 100 deals instead of 2
- Incredibly valuable business with 98% retention
- Just need to fix conversion

The Deeper Issue: Principal-Agent Problem
- Presenting to wrong people
- Building owners want to save money (the principal)
- Building managers have to do the work (the agent)
- Owners said yes, managers said no
- Managers had decision-making power
- Managers wouldn't get paid more for extra work

Real Solution: Rescript for the Real Customer
- The building manager is the real customer
- Elevate the status of the manager
- Make it all about them
- "What business are you really in? What customer do you really serve?"
- This was the $10 million+ question

CASE STUDY #7: ONLINE COURSE CREATOR / YOUTUBER

Situation:
- High completion rates
- Great results
- Great reviews
- Breaking even despite digital product (no delivery cost)
- Every new customer barely profitable after ad costs

Owner Thinks: "The problem is marketing" - spending on fancy funnels and paid ads

Possible Problems (Multiple):

1. Priced Too Low
   - Could double price and sales might only drop 15%
   - Immediately fixes business

2. Ads Suck
   - Quality problem
   - OR quantity problem (not making enough ads)
   - OR ads are good but outdated

Pricing Strategy (Even in Demand Constraint):
- Why raise prices in demand constraint?
- Because can't afford to get more customers at current price
- Need to raise prices to afford marketing spend

Example:
- Raise $1,000 course to $3,000
- Sales drop 15-20%
- Revenue nearly triples overnight
- Add $10,000 high-end version
- 10% of market purchases = extra $1,000 per sale
- Goes from $1,000 to $4,000 total per sale
- Same content, same marketing, very different results

Content/Ads Solution:
- Use best organic content as paid ads
- Add 5-second CTA at end
- If organic content generated sales, amplify with ad spend
- Don't overthink "ad creative" - use what's already working

Landing Page Optimization:
- Don't send to beautiful homepage
- Send to conversion-optimized page
- Capture information FIRST
- Then give them what they want
- Then they can explore site
- People have high motivation for SHORT periods
- Must maximize that window

On Website Aesthetics:
- Acquisition.com is "hideous" (Hormozi's words)
- Gets DMs daily offering redesigns
- Could it be improved? Yes
- Resources required vs. other growth opportunities
- Typically converts fine despite being ugly
- Not the constraint
- Better to focus resources elsewhere

Key Lesson: We spend time doing stuff we love because we love it, but business might not need it. We solve problems that don't need solving. We invest limited resources toward problems that increase POTENTIAL but not THROUGHPUT.

The Highway Analogy:
- Four lanes, then one lane, then four lanes
- If you expand the four lanes to five lanes, does traffic go faster? NO
- That's what happens when you improve website without improving conversion
- You increased potential, not throughput
- Spent time and money with no business impact

CASE STUDY #8: MOBILE APP COMPANY

Situation:
- Can "vibe code" with cursor AI
- "If you build it they will come" (most dangerous myth in business)
- Incredible product - easy to use
- World-class tech team
- App is fast and beautiful
- User growth painfully slow
- Few thousand users when need millions

Founders Think: "Maybe we need more features, maybe it's too hard to get started"

Problem: DEMAND constrained
- App isn't the issue
- AWARENESS is the problem
- Spending almost nothing on marketing
- Relying on word of mouth
- Have serious demand problem but putting effort into product

Solutions:

1. Optimize App Store Listing
   - Higher conversion rate = multiple benefits
   - Sales velocity goes up = higher ranking
   - Apple pushes more traffic (they get percentage)
   - Highest converting products get best placement

2. Pay for User Acquisition
   - Shift talent from backend to "maximize downloads and activation"

3. Affiliate Play
   - What apps already serve this exact market?
   - Run banner ads on someone else's product
   - Marketplaces exist to buy these ad placements

4. Strong Referral Program
   - Depends on nature of product
   - Built-in viral loops

Result: Could grow user base 20-100x in a year by shifting effort from product (which is good enough) to solving real problem (demand).

THE ACCORDION EFFECT:

Is it always supply or demand constraint? YES, but not always the same one at the same time.

The Natural Flow:
1. Solve demand constraint
2. Now you have supply constraint
3. Solve supply constraint
4. Now you have demand constraint
5. Back and forth forever

Example:
- Fitness equipment back in stock (solved supply)
- Not running any ads (now have demand problem)
- Hire four more accountants (solved supply)
- Don't have more clients (now have demand problem)

Why Businesses Get Stuck for YEARS:
- They stayed working on demand constraint after it became supply constraint
- OR vice versa
- Lack of awareness that the constraint has MOVED
- Solved constraint so well they created another one
- Didn't switch where attention was allocated

You're Not an Idiot: You started solving a constraint, solved it well, created another one, but didn't switch your focus.

DIAGNOSTIC BATTERY:

Answer These Questions Honestly:

Supply Constraint Indicators:
1. If more customers showed up tomorrow, could you serve them at the standard you want? (No = Supply)
2. Are you turning away business or putting people on waiting lists? (Yes = Supply)
3. Are your most profitable time slots or products always sold out? (Yes = Supply)
4. Do you run out of inventory or have long shipping delays? (Yes = Supply)

If YES to any = likely SUPPLY problem

SOLVING SUPPLY CONSTRAINTS:

1. Raise Prices (Easiest and Fastest)
   - Creates immediate breathing room
   - Generates cash for other solutions
   - Reduces demand to match capacity

2. Add Capacity
   - Hire more people
   - Buy more equipment
   - Expand facilities

3. Clean Up Operations (Get Leverage from Existing People)
   Three methods for service businesses:

   a) Technology
      - Tech allows one person to do 5x the work
      - Systems and automation

   b) Training
      - Level B talent becomes level A talent
      - Can now do 5x the work

   c) More People
      - Hire another B-level person
      - Double the B's

SOLVING DEMAND CONSTRAINTS:

If you answered NO to supply questions = DEMAND problem

Focus Areas:

1. Fix Acquisition Channel
   - Outreach
   - Affiliates
   - Ads
   - Content strategy
   - Or combination

2. Fix Conversion (Sales Constraint)
   Even if getting people, might not turn into sales

   Advertising Side:
   - How you're generating demand
   - Quality of traffic

   Technical Component:
   - How capturing leads
   - Landing page layout
   - Headlines
   - Images
   - Copy
   - Lead magnet
   - Assessment/call offer
   - Benefit for taking next action
   - Might not be compelling enough

3. People Problem
   - People suck
   - Not following the process

4. Process Problem
   - Process itself sucks
   - Selling to wrong person
   - Wrong thing
   - Wrong time

5. Offer Issue
   - Right people at right time
   - But offer not compelling

6. Price Problem (Applies to BOTH Constraints)
   - Doing everything right
   - Just not charging enough
   - Can't spend enough on marketing to be profitable

THE TRAP:

If you fix the wrong problem:
- Wastes money and time
- Often makes it WORSE
- This is why business owners work so hard and feel so much pain
- Constraint switched
- You didn't switch what you were doing
- By succeeding at thing that's no longer the constraint, you further strain the system

Hormozi's Personal Experience:
- Almost always able to out-advertise any business
- Almost always had supply constraints
- Had to learn to step back
- Sometimes had to let marketing be mediocre
- "Even if I fix it, it will literally make my business worse"
- Leads not getting followed up breaks his heart
- But can't take them on anyway
- Would hurt reputation more than not following up

If you have SUPPLY problem: More marketing creates chaos and unhappy customers
If you have DEMAND problem: Better operations doesn't help when there's no one to serve

CONTINUOUS PROCESS:

This is not a one-time fix. It's a way of thinking.

Most successful businesses:
- Keep finding their current constraint
- Break through it
- Move to next one
- Repeat forever

FRAMEWORK SUMMARY:

1. Identify: Supply or Demand?
   - Simple test: If I doubled marketing, what happens?

2. Diagnose Deeper:
   - If supply: Pricing? Capacity? Operations?
   - If demand: Acquisition? Conversion? Sales process? Offer? Price?

3. Focus Resources:
   - Stop working on non-constraints
   - Allocate all effort to actual constraint
   - Increase throughput, not just potential

4. Solve and Switch:
   - Fix the constraint
   - Immediately look for new constraint
   - Shift focus accordingly

5. Repeat:
   - This accordion effect is natural
   - Constraint will always exist
   - The one who grows fastest is the one who identifies and solves fastest

FINAL WISDOM:

Warren Buffett: "There's nothing worse than doing well with something that shouldn't be done at all."

The path to making your accountant nervous with growth:
- Stop solving problems that don't exist
- Identify your actual constraint
- Focus ruthlessly on solving it
- Watch for when it switches
- Solve the new constraint
- Repeat

Two-thirds of businesses stuck at same revenue for 2+ years. If that's you, it's not that you're failing - you're likely succeeding at the wrong constraint.

Success isn't about working harder - it's about working hard on the RIGHT problem.
