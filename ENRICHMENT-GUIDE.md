## ENRICHMENT TEMPLATE (What to Add to Each)

For each of the top 50, add:

### 1. Real-World Context (Replace Generic)
**BEFORE:**
```
## When To Use This
- Create cold email sequence
- For lead automation
- When you need to email sequence builder
```

**AFTER:**
```
## When To Use This
- You have 100+ cold leads and need a proven sequence to warm them up
- Your open rates are low and you need better subject lines and timing
- You're launching a product and need automated nurture to build urgency
- You have a sales team that's overwhelmed with follow-ups
```

### 2. Step-by-Step Real Implementation (Not Generic)
**BEFORE:**
```
### Step 2: Query Knowledge Base
Search `ghl-best-practices` for: email sequences, nurturing
Search `ghl-tutorials` for: implementation guides
```

**AFTER:**
```
### Step 2: Query Knowledge Base
Search `ghl-best-practices` for: "cold email templates", "email open rate optimization", "follow-up timing psychology"
Search `ghl-tutorials` for: "Gmail warm-up", "email sequence automation", "deliverability checklist"

KB will return:
- Subject line formulas that get 45%+ open rates
- Optimal send times by industry
- Follow-up sequences that work (3-email, 5-email, 7-email variants)
- A/B testing frameworks
```

### 3. Output Examples (Real JSON/Config)
**BEFORE:**
```
## Output Format
Depends on command type: JSON workflow, guide, checklist, or analysis
```

**AFTER:**
```
## Output Format
This command returns a complete workflow JSON:

{
  "name": "Cold Email Sequence - [Industry]",
  "trigger": {
    "type": "contact_tagged",
    "tag": "cold_lead"
  },
  "actions": [
    {
      "type": "send_email",
      "delay_days": 0,
      "template": "Email 1: Curiosity Hook",
      "subject": "[Personalization] + [Curiosity Hook]"
    },
    {
      "type": "wait",
      "days": 3
    },
    {
      "type": "send_email",
      "template": "Email 2: Social Proof",
      "subject": "[Proof Point] + [Benefit]"
    },
    // ... more emails
  ]
}
```

### 4. Common Mistakes (Specific Not Generic)
**BEFORE:**
```
## Common Mistakes
- Mistake 1: Not customizing for your specific use case
- Mistake 2: Skipping the deployment validation step
- Mistake 3: Not reviewing the generated output before deploying
```

**AFTER:**
```
## Common Mistakes
- Mistake 1: Making your first email too salesy (kills 60% of opens). Lead with value/curiosity.
- Mistake 2: Not warming up your sending domain first (lands in spam). Use authentication + slow ramp.
- Mistake 3: Using generic subject lines (25% open rate). Use personalization tokens + urgency tactics.
- Mistake 4: Sending at 9am EST for global audience. Use recipient timezone + their industry's peak times.
- Mistake 5: Not A/B testing subject lines. Cost: lost $50k+ in revenue per 1M emails.
```

### 5. Industry Variations
Add a section:
```
## Industry-Specific Variations

### For SaaS Companies:
- Lead with ROI/time saved metrics
- Use technical credibility (testimonials from engineers)
- Focus on integration/setup ease
- Follow-up timing: 3, 5, 10, 15 days (longer consideration)

### For Agencies:
- Lead with case study results
- Use portfolio social proof
- Focus on speed of implementation
- Follow-up timing: 2, 4, 7 days (faster buying cycles)

### For E-Commerce:
- Lead with scarcity/urgency
- Use product social proof
- Focus on conversion rate
- Follow-up timing: 1, 2, 3 days (impulse buying)
```
