DOMAINS AND URL REDIRECTS TUTORIAL - Complete Guide to Managing Domains in Go High Level

TRANSCRIPT:

Tired of juggling GoDaddy name cheap in a dozen other tools just to keep your businesses online. With high level, you can set up, manage and transfer domains, plus set up websites, funnels, and courses.

You can do all of this in one place without ever leaving the high level platform. And in this video I'm gonna show you how to do every single one of these step by step.

WHAT IS A DOMAIN

So the first thing I wanna do is break down what a domain is in as simple language as possible. So a domain really is just an identifier of your site, and subdomains and extensions are just basic ways to categorize your site.

So a subdomain is anything that comes before. The name, which is the domain. So you could have courses, high level, you could have help high level, you could have happiness, whatever you want. You can put the subdomain first. Okay.

And then that will be added in, and that's the subdomain. You can change that multiple times for domain, okay? But you can't have multiple domains for a subdomain, but you can have multiple subdomains for domain, a domain.

The thing itself. So go high level, Declan the wizard, amazon.com, It's just going to be the name of the thing.

Then the extension is the last part, which is.com, dot co, dot ai. Whatever you want, you can slap that in there.

So That is essentially what a domain is. If you guys have any questions at all, drum down in the comments, and I'll answer as fast as possible.

Now we're gonna go into setting up domains, transferring and doing all this other stuff so you can get everything you want in high level live asap.

ACCESSING DOMAINS IN HIGH LEVEL

So to access domains and that whole part inside of high level, you're gonna come into your subaccount. You're gonna go right down to settings and you're gonna scroll to domains and URL L redirects.

Don't worry, we will cover URL redirects after we cover domains. So in here you will see three different. Options. Okay.

Number one, you can purchase a domain, so that is buying and acquiring domain.

Number two, you can transfer a domain, which is bringing in from GoDaddy, name cheap Squarespace. Wherever you have it, you can plug it into high level.

Then number three, we have connecting a domain, which is where it will stay on another registrar, but it'll be connected to high level, so you can use it, and we're gonna go over all three.

PURCHASING A DOMAIN

So first up, we are going to purchase a domain. So you're gonna click that button, you're gonna come right in here, and you're gonna type in the name of the domain. You want.

So what we're gonna do is we're gonna do Declan the wizard, then we're gonna do.com. 'cause you can put in your extension. So we're gonna click search. Remember the extension, we talked about that earlier.

And you can see Hazah, it's available. How cool is that? But you can also see down here all the other options with the other extensions. So, dot com, we have.me.org, tech. I mean, you see it just goes on with a bunch of random stuff.

Dot com is pretty much the standard. It's the best, but you can always get other ones like do AI or stuff like that. And to do that, you would just come in here and say, I want. AI if it's not available. Um, and then you search that and then you will see right there.

So that's kind of expensive. So you see how the prices kind of change for certain stuff. AI is hot right now, so it costs a little more. Um, but basic things are all pretty much the same price per year. They're not per month, per year.

So it's like 12 bucks a year for most domains, which is really cheap. So then we picked the exact one we wanted, which was.com. So we're gonna search this. Okay. Then we're gonna come right in here. We see, okay, this looks good. And we're going to click buy. Now.

This is what we want to do. We wanna be very careful 'cause they have a lot of add-ons here. Okay? 'cause you see right here it says Protect your brand from competitors. You don't need all those.

Now you could, if you wanted, if you really think it's important, but you wanna unclick these and you see how the price goes down, and then you would pick it for how long you want it. So.

For SEO purposes, the longer you have it, it does help a bit. But if you're just testing out, get it for one year and it's $12 for the entire year.

Then from there, you come right in here and you click agree, and then you click pay $12, and then you will now have the domain. Once it goes through, it'll go through the loading screen. It'll show you that you have it.

You then can come right back here and you will see your domain popped up.

Now, real quick, 'cause I wanna cover everything. If you don't see a way to purchase a domain in here and you're like, where is it? It's not on my screen, but it's on Declan's. Go back to agency view. Okay? Which is this side.

Come down to settings and go to domain purchase, and then here you can toggle it on or off for your accounts. Then that's how it's gonna pop up. So make sure you do that. If you don't see it, very, very important.

We'll get into rebuilding later, so don't worry about that. Okay? So that's how we purchase a domain. That's how you buy it. So very simple.

TRANSFERRING A DOMAIN

Then, okay, we have transfer in a domain, which is a little more complicated. This is how we're going to take a domain from GoDaddy, name chiefs, wherever, and bring it into high level. So it's now officially in high level forever.

So let's come in here. And we're gonna transfer this domain right in here. So you put in whatever domain you want to move from your extension. We're gonna do this, we're gonna click continue.

Then right here, it's gonna immediately identify the domain, where it's from, the current registration, all that extra stuff, the price, which is really cool. So it immediately has that. So then we're gonna click continue.

So then you have two different options. You can upload the DNS Zone file, which you're gonna need to do, or you can scan the records, which is gonna go through and scan it.

Now every domain registrar is a little different. Okay, i'm gonna show you the basics on GoDaddy because that's what I use, but it's gonna change depending on what you're doing. Okay? Because different registrar different, but it's all in the same place. It's DNS manage. It's the same rubric, so to speak.

So then you'd come into GoDaddy, whatever you're using. Okay. Got to DNS. Come right down here. Click Actions again, you can just chat GBT this if you're trying to find stuff. But you would just click export Zone file and it's gonna download it.

Then you come right in here, you click upload and you upload that exact file that just went in. So very simple. You can do that or you can click the scan records, which is gonna go through and just scan the current Dina charts to make sure everything is good.

Okay, from there we go. Yay. These are all awesome. You check it. If you like it and everything is the way you want it to be. Remember you can always use chat GBT to find exactly where this stuff is. 'cause it always changes.

We come right down here once we like the way everything looks and we're gonna click, I confirm and you know, crosschecked and all this other jazz. Then we're gonna click continue.

Then what you're gonna do is you're gonna come right in, go to your domain, scroll down, click transfer a new registrar. It'll be right under your domain and whatever server you have, you just click it, scroll to the bottom, and you'll see transfer domain.

Once you come in here, you click continue. Okay? And then right here, what you're gonna get is you're going to get here to get your authorization code.

So then we're gonna click it and then you're gonna take this. You're gonna copy it. You're gonna come right back in here and you're going to paste this code right in here.

Then you're gonna click confirm and finalize transfer. And then right in here, you're gonna go through waiting a pending approval and then you're good to go.

So you just have to follow this process. It is a bit tricky to find that EEP code. Okay. Which is the thing we just did.

So what I recommend you do since every domain registrar is different is you go to chat gt and you figure out where to find the EEP code. Watch a video on it, because everyone is different and it changes.

It's roughly always in the same place, which is when you transfer a domain, it'll be right under there. So that's relatively easy, but it depends on what you're doing.

Or you can drop a comment down below and I'll try to help ease you through it. It is relatively easy, you just gotta find it.

So once we're there, we just wait. And make sure everything is good, and make sure your domain is good. Once it is approved, though, we would go back to domains and you would see it just like this right in here, and it's ready to go.

This has not been fully done because it has to be approved and we have to go through on the other side of GoDaddy, but from there, we are then good to go and it's in our account.

CONNECTING A DOMAIN

So now we move on to the last part with the domains, which is connecting a domain. So this is just bringing a domain in here. It's not transferring, it's adding in a high list. You can use it for other things and you can pick exactly what you want it to connect to.

But for right now, we want to just connect it and bring it in. So what we're gonna do is we're gonna come back into GoDaddy. Okay? We're gonna copy and paste the domain, or you can just type it in, just like that.

We're gonna come right in here. We're gonna click paste, and then we're gonna click continue from here because it's with GoDaddy. You can just click continue and it's gonna do it automatically, which is really cool.

Now, you might have to change some stuff, but manually it's just going in and tweaking it the other way, which is adding in records.

So then we click authorized domain. Once that looks good, we click connect, then it will say, David's Plumbing and Sons is now a lead connector domain.

So we come back here, we wait for this to authorized. Sometimes it doesn't go through, but if it never does, it's because of the. DNS records aren't properly configured, which there's a way to add it manually. Which, when you click it, it'll tell you exactly what to add.

So that's how you connect the domain.

ADDING DNS RECORDS MANUALLY

Now, just to give you a quick update on the manual version, we come in here, we paste this right here, we click continue. You just click this right here, and you click add records manually, and it tells you exactly what to add, and you just add them into the DNS records.

You create the A records, you create the host, the required value, and then you are good to go.

And if you want me to take an even step further, if it's confusing, I will just quickly show you so we have a record. You would come in, you would click add new record. You would choose a. Very simple. You follow record, a host. We come in, here we go.

Name, which is That is the host. Which we would put is at, we do at. And then you come right in here and you type this exact code, okay? And you'd paste it right here, which is the value, and then you click save.

So that's how you do it manually. And guys, I'm just showing you, but it's so simple. You just go, eh, okay, record. Cool. And you just add, add, add. And the next one would be C name.

So you come and you'd add another record and you call it C name. Very simple. It didn't get any easier than that, but that's how you would do it manually, if it doesn't properly go through.

So that's just to show you, to make sure you have it. Again, any questions you have, drop 'em down below.

MANAGING DOMAINS AND DNS

So now once you have your domain connected in here, there's a couple really important things to note. If you've transferred a domain, which we technically did, but it takes, a while to get here. So we have to go through the approval, but we haven't done that. We followed all the steps. We could click approval.

I don't want this domain here. It's just a test. If you connect it, what we just did via your other domain register not okay. Transferring. You will not be able to access the DNS.

So if you own the domain or you fully transferred it, when you click manage, you'll be able to access the DNS records in here. If you have just connected it, you still have to go through your other registrar like GoDaddy to access the DNS.

So that's a really important fact to know. And again, when you click manage, you'll see it here, but you also see. What it's connected to. So this is not connected to anything, but you can see, oh wow, it's connected to this. Connect to that, and then you can click connect and add it into your email, WordPress, all that stuff, which we're gonna get into a sec, but just to let you know, you click manage and that's how you would see where it's at.

So that kind of gives you a full scope. So you can always come back here to domains in your redirects, and you can have access to this, so you can edit it.

FREE TRIAL AND BONUSES

Okay, so now it's time to show you how to connect this to a website, a funnel. A community, whatever you want. But before we jump into that, okay. I just wanna let you know if you are interested more in high level, more about learning this entire process.

CONNECTING DOMAINS TO WEBSITES

So to connect a website or really anything you want, you can just come right into Manage and click Connect. And right here, it's gonna show you all the different options you get.

So to connect a website, you can come right here, click Connect, email. You just follow the steps. I mean, it's so easy that you just click and follow along.

Like for example, client portal. If you want to access the courses, you click connect. And it's gonna take you to the client portal side. Then you just put in your domain right here and click add domain, and then you're good to go.

It's so straightforward. It tells you exactly what to do and that's how you can connect it to multiple different things.

Now there is another way to connect the websites. Now the easiest way is what I just showed you, where you go in and you click Connect website.

But if you come in here and let's say we like Declan's Snapshot under Funnels, we can just click edit right here. Okay? Then we can click settings. Then we can also click domain and just click it, come down and click save, and then you have a domain added in, just like that.

And you can do the same thing right up here in websites. If we say, okay, we want Nove real estate, we're gonna click this right here, go right to settings, click domain, click it, and you're good to go.

So that is another way to add it, just to let you know. So it's very simple guys. It's extremely straightforward. I mean, anyone can do this. High level makes it so easy.

And if you guys have any questions, drop a comment down below so I can guide you. But that way, immediately when you come in, you can come in and you can start adding your domain to your websites and make everything live very, very quickly.

DOMAIN REBILLING

Okay, so one of the last things I wanna show you before we jump into UR redirects is a sneaky little way to make extra money, and that is rebilling on your domain.

So if you come to agency view and you click into a sub account, okay, that's you own and control. And guys, this is on the 4 97 plan, but if we come right in here to rebilling.

You can actually come down and you'll see domain purchase. So if you click this, the guys, again, 4 97 plan, you gotta have that one, but you can actually mark up the price when someone buys a domain, so you make it a little extra money.

Now this is really great if they're gonna be buying domains through your account anyway. Again, you don't wanna make it absurd. You obviously want to tell them, but you can have them buy a domain and then you can charge them an extra $2 Every year you're making that extra two bucks.

It doesn't seem like a lot, but when you got hundreds of subaccounts, rebuilding adds up really quickly.

So that's how you would come in and you would add the rebill side of things. You can just play with this however you want. Obviously I always tell people be transparent, but you can dial in exactly how much you want to charge for them to buy domains under you.

And guys, really great way to make some extra money. Again, done. I know it doesn't seem like a lot, but all of this rebuilding, it adds up drastically. And if you are interested in rebuilding, you're like, that's awesome. Watch the video on my channel that goes in depth on that. 'cause this is a game changer if you are an agency.

URL REDIRECTS

Alright, so now that you understand everything about domains in high level, how to transfer, connect, buy, all that good stuff, we now want to go into URL Redirects. This is an awesome feature. This can be very handy.

All this does is when someone types in your URL, so ww dot declan is amazing.com, it then could send them to amazon.com or whatever. It can just redirect them to another URL.

So to do a URL redirect, we're gonna click add a redirect. You're gonna select the exact domain you want in your account member. You can have multiple domains in your account.

You're gonna click this right here, or whatever domain you want. Then you're gonna put in the path. The path is what comes after this. Now, technically you could just have it right after, but that would be really bad because then your website's going to another website, which you could do with a regular domain, but you want to add a path.

So we're gonna do slash. Money. Okay. Just say we created that extra path, which you just create through a website page. And then you're gonna want URL as the redirect type.

Then we're gonna put in the target URL. So what's the target? URL gonna be? It's gonna be metromont.com.

So now check this out. Anytime someone types David Plumbing and sun slash money in, it's gonna go right to here.

So let's experiment. So what we're gonna do is we're gonna come right over and over to Google. We're gonna type in this right here, and then we're gonna do slash money. Actually, you know what's even better, let's just put this right up here. We're gonna click enter, and.

Look at that, it now goes ching to a different URL by just typing in that one thing.

So it's super cool. Guys, you can do that with really any URL you're trying to shift to. And this can be really handy if you have multiple domains that you want pointing to one website. You can increase your traffic like crazy.

So guys, that's how you do URL redirects I showed you. I typed in for you, I proved it for you. It's awesome. I definitely recommend you play with it 'cause it is something that can. Add a lot of extra traffic and make things much smoother in your process, and it's one of those little features in high level that a lot of people don't use or know about, and I just showed you how to use it, so make sure you utilize it.
