## Description
Email drip campaigns consist of a series of automated, pre-scheduled messages sent to contacts over time to maintain consistent communication without overwhelming recipients. These campaigns guide prospects through the customer journey by delivering valuable information, offers, and incentives at strategic intervals, building trust and brand recall while moving leads toward conversion. By segmenting audiences based on interactions and behaviors, drip sequences ensure messages align with recipient needs and preferences for maximum engagement.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Define Campaign Segmentation**
   - Navigate to Contacts > Smart Lists in GoHighLevel
   - Create audience segments based on lead source, industry, engagement level, or behavior
   - Tag contacts appropriately to trigger relevant drip sequences
   - Document your segment criteria for future optimization

2. **Map the Customer Journey**
   - Identify key stages: awareness, consideration, decision, retention
   - Define 5-7 email touchpoints that guide prospects through each stage
   - Plan content themes: welcome message, educational content, social proof, product features, special offer, urgency message, final follow-up
   - Set timing intervals between emails (recommended: 1-3 day gaps for early emails, 5-7 days for later emails)

3. **Create Email Content**
   - Write personalized subject lines with dynamic fields ({{contact.first_name}})
   - Craft concise, value-focused email copy (150-300 words per email)
   - Include clear single call-to-action in each email
   - Design mobile-responsive templates in GHL email builder
   - Add relevant visuals and ensure brand consistency

4. **Build Workflow Automation**
   - Go to Automation > Workflows > Create Workflow
   - Set trigger: Form Submitted, Tag Added, or Contact Created
   - Add Email action with first message
   - Insert Wait/Delay action (e.g., wait 2 days)
   - Continue adding Email and Wait actions for full sequence
   - Add conditional branches based on email opens/clicks for advanced personalization

5. **Configure Deliverability Settings**
   - Verify custom domain with SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records
   - Warm up new sending domains gradually (start 50 emails/day, increase by 50% weekly)
   - Use "From" name that recipients recognize
   - Include clear unsubscribe option in every email

6. **Implement Testing and Optimization**
   - Use A/B testing for subject lines on first 2-3 emails
   - Send test emails to team members before publishing workflow
   - Monitor open rates (target 20-30%), click-through rates (target 2-5%), and conversions
   - Review analytics weekly and adjust timing, content, or segmentation based on performance
   - Remove non-engaging contacts after 3-4 unopened emails to maintain list health

## Expected Outcomes

- **Consistent Lead Engagement**: Maintain top-of-mind awareness with prospects through systematic touchpoints
- **Improved Conversion Rates**: Drip campaigns typically achieve 15-20% higher conversion rates than one-off emails
