## Description
A/B split testing is a data-driven methodology for optimizing form performance by comparing two versions of a form or landing page to determine which converts better. Rather than relying on assumptions about what works, split testing provides empirical evidence by randomly dividing traffic between a Control version and a Variation, then measuring conversion rates, click-through rates, and other key performance indicators. This approach eliminates guesswork and enables continuous incremental improvements that compound over time to dramatically increase overall conversion rates.

The power of split testing lies in its ability to reveal user preferences and behaviors that often contradict conventional wisdom or designer intuition. Small changes to headlines, button colors, form field arrangements, or call-to-action wording can produce surprisingly large impacts on conversion rates. By systematically testing individual elements one at a time, you build a knowledge base of what resonates with your specific audience, leading to optimized forms that convert significantly better than original designs. GoHighLevel's built-in split testing capabilities make this scientific approach accessible without requiring external tools or complex integrations.

## Implementation Steps

1. Prepare your funnel for split testing
   - Navigate to Sites > Funnels (or Websites) in your GoHighLevel account
   - Ensure a custom domain is connected to your funnel (required for split testing)
   - Select the funnel containing the form or page you want to test
   - Identify the specific funnel step where your form appears
   - Review your current analytics to establish baseline conversion metrics

2. Create your test variation
   - Click on the funnel step you want to test
   - Click the "Create Variation" button
   - Choose from three creation options:
     - Duplicate version (clones your current Control page for minor modifications)
     - Create from blank (builds an entirely new variation from scratch)
     - Import from template (uses a pre-built template as your variation)
   - Name your variation descriptively (e.g., "Red CTA Button" or "3-Field Form")

3. Modify your variation strategically
   - Test only ONE element at a time for clear attribution of results
   - Common high-impact elements to test on forms:
     - Headlines and subheadlines above the form
     - Number of form fields (test removing non-essential fields)
     - Form field order and arrangement
     - Call-to-action button text, color, and size
     - Trust signals and social proof placement
     - Form labels versus placeholder text
     - Images or videos accompanying the form
   - Make the difference noticeable enough to potentially impact behavior
   - Avoid modifying the Control page during active testing

4. Configure traffic distribution
   - Use the traffic distribution slider to allocate visitors between Control and Variation
   - Start with 50/50 split for equal statistical sample sizes
   - Adjust to 70/30 or other ratios if you want to limit exposure to riskier variations
   - Understand that visitors are redirected via browser cookies to maintain consistency
   - Each visitor will see the same version throughout their session

5. Launch and monitor your split test
   - Click "Start Split Test" to activate traffic distribution
   - Confirm the changes when prompted
   - Navigate to the Stats tab to access real-time performance data
   - Click on your test page to view detailed comparison metrics
   - Monitor these key metrics:
     - Conversion rate (primary success metric)
     - Total conversions per variation
     - Bounce rate and time on page
     - Form abandonment rate if available
     - Cost per conversion if running paid traffic

6. Analyze results and implement winners
   - Allow sufficient time for statistical significance (typically 100+ conversions per variation minimum)
   - Ensure you have adequate traffic volume (at least 1000 visitors per variation recommended)
   - Evaluate whether the winning variation shows meaningful improvement (typically 10%+ lift)
   - Consider confidence levels and statistical significance before declaring a winner
   - Implement the winning variation as your new Control page
   - Document your findings for future reference and team knowledge sharing
   - Begin planning your next test on a different element

## Expected Outcomes

- 10-50% improvement in form conversion rates through systematic testing and optimization
- 15-30% increase in overall funnel conversion by optimizing each step through split testing
- 20-40% reduction in cost per lead or cost per acquisition when running paid traffic
- Data-driven decision making that eliminates subjective debates about design choices
- Continuous compounding improvements as each test builds on previous winners
- Deeper understanding of your specific audience preferences and behaviors
- Reduced bounce rates and improved engagement metrics on form pages
- Higher return on investment for traffic generation efforts (SEO, ads, social media)
- Competitive advantage through scientifically optimized conversion paths
- Documented best practices library specific to your business and audience
