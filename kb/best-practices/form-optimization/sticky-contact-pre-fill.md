## Description
Sticky Contact is a cookie-based feature in GoHighLevel that automatically pre-fills form fields with data previously entered by returning visitors. This intelligent form enhancement dramatically improves user experience by eliminating repetitive data entry across forms, surveys, and calendar booking pages. When enabled, the system stores contact information in browser cookies and automatically populates fields like name, email, and phone number on subsequent visits, accelerating the submission process and reducing friction in multi-step funnels.

This feature is particularly valuable for businesses with returning customers or multi-touch conversion funnels. By remembering user information, Sticky Contact reduces the psychological barrier of form completion and demonstrates respect for the visitor's time. The technology works seamlessly in the background, requiring no action from users while significantly improving conversion rates by removing one of the most common objections to form completion: the tedious nature of re-entering information.

## Implementation Steps

1. Enable Sticky Contact for standard forms
   - Navigate to Sites > Forms in your GoHighLevel account
   - Select the form you want to optimize
   - Click "Form Settings" in the form builder interface
   - Locate the "Sticky Contact" toggle switch
   - Turn the toggle ON to activate the feature
   - Save your form settings

2. Enable Sticky Contact for surveys
   - Go to Sites > Surveys in your account dashboard
   - Select the survey you want to enhance
   - Open "Survey Settings" from the builder menu
   - Find the "Sticky Contact" toggle option
   - Activate the toggle to enable pre-fill functionality
   - Save your survey configuration

3. Enable Sticky Contact for calendar bookings
   - Access Calendars from your main navigation menu
   - Click "Calendar Settings" for the calendar you want to modify
   - Select the specific calendar from your list
   - Scroll to the "Forms & Payments" section
   - Enable the "Sticky Contact" toggle
   - For custom calendar forms: enable the feature on the form itself, not in calendar settings
   - Save all changes

4. Verify cookie functionality and user notifications
   - Test the form by submitting information in a standard browser
   - Return to the same form in the same browser to confirm pre-fill works
   - Ensure your privacy policy mentions cookie usage for GDPR compliance
   - Add a brief notice on forms indicating that data may be remembered for convenience
   - Test across different browsers to verify cookie behavior

5. Identify appropriate use cases
   - Deploy for customer-facing forms where returning visitors are common
   - Use in multi-step funnels where users might revisit forms
   - Enable for webinar registration, newsletter signups, and content downloads
   - Implement for customer support forms and feedback surveys
   - Activate for calendar booking forms to speed up appointment scheduling

6. Recognize and avoid inappropriate scenarios
   - Do NOT enable when internal team members complete forms on behalf of customers
   - Disable for kiosk or shared computer environments where multiple users access the same device
   - Avoid for high-security applications requiring fresh authentication each time
   - Turn off when staff members repeatedly submit forms for different clients
   - Disable if your business uses tablets or computers shared among customers
