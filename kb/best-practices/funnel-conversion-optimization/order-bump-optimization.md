## Description

Order bumps are complementary, low-priced offers presented during checkout that customers can add to their purchase with a single click. Unlike upsells (shown after purchase), order bumps appear on the checkout page itself, allowing customers to enhance their order before completing payment.

When implemented effectively, order bumps increase average order value (AOV) by 10-30% without requiring additional traffic or marketing spend. They represent one of the quickest wins in funnel optimization because they monetize existing buyer intent at the moment of highest purchase motivation.

The key to successful order bumps is relevance and value alignment. The offer must naturally complement the main purchase, be priced appropriately (typically lower than the core product), and add genuine value without creating decision friction that might stall the transaction.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Select Complementary Products**
   - Choose order bumps that naturally enhance the main product
   - Ensure the add-on solves a related problem or extends the core value
   - Examples:
     * Main product: Online course → Bump: Workbook or template pack
     * Main product: Service package → Bump: Priority support upgrade
     * Main product: Software subscription → Bump: Implementation checklist or training
   - Make the connection obvious ("Perfect pairing with your purchase")

2. **Strategic Pricing**
   - Price bumps at 20-50% of the main product cost
   - Make it a "no-brainer" decision that doesn't require lengthy consideration
   - Test pricing: If conversion rate is under 20-30%, price is likely too high
   - If conversion rate exceeds 70%, you're underpricing and leaving money on the table
   - Use psychological pricing ($27 instead of $30)

3. **Craft Clear Value Proposition**
   - Lead with the benefit, not the feature
   - Use urgency language: "Add this now and save $X" or "One-time offer"
   - Keep copy concise - customers should grasp value instantly
   - Include specific outcomes: "Complete setup in half the time" vs generic "Save time"
   - Display original price crossed out to show discount value

4. **Design for Low Friction**
   - Use simple checkbox or toggle (no additional pages or forms)
   - Place bump offer prominently but not disruptively on checkout page
   - Show clear before/after pricing when bump is selected
   - Ensure mobile-friendly design with easy-to-tap selection
   - No additional input fields required

5. **Test Multiple Variables**
   - Test different bump products to find best performers
   - Test positioning: above vs below payment form
   - Test copy variations: benefit-focused vs urgency-focused
   - Test visual presentation: image vs no image, color schemes
   - A/B test pricing points
   - Track metrics: conversion rate, revenue per visitor, total revenue impact

6. **Monitor Revenue Metrics, Not Just Conversion**
   - Focus on total revenue increase, not just bump conversion rate
   - Calculate: (Bump conversion rate × Bump price) = Revenue per visitor
   - Sometimes lower-converting, higher-priced bumps generate more revenue
   - Track cart abandonment rate to ensure bump doesn't create friction
   - Monitor completion time to identify if bump adds decision paralysis

## Expected Outcomes

- **AOV Increase:** 10-30% improvement in average order value from well-optimized order bumps
- **Revenue Multiplication:** Adds significant revenue without additional traffic acquisition costs
- **Conversion Rate Benchmarks:**
  * 20-30% bump conversion rate = appropriately priced and relevant
  * Under 20% = likely overpriced or not relevant enough
  * Over 70% = significantly underpriced, opportunity to increase price
- **Quick Implementation:** One of the fastest funnel optimization wins, often implemented in under an hour
- **Compound Effect:** When combined with upsells post-purchase, can double revenue per customer

The beauty of order bumps is they leverage existing buyer psychology at peak purchase intent. Customers who've already decided to buy are in a "yes" mindset, making them far more receptive to relevant additions that enhance their initial purchase decision.
