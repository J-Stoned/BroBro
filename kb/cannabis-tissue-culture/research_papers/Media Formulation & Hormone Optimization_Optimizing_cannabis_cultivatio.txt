        <title>Optimizing cannabis cultivation: an efficient in vitro system for flowering induction | Plant Methods | Full Text</title>

        
    
    <meta name="citation_abstract" content="Cannabis sativa L. is a versatile medicinal plant known for its therapeutic properties, derived from its diverse array of secondary metabolites synthesized primarily in female flower organs. Breeding cannabis is challenging due to its dioecious nature, strict regulatory requirements, and the need for photoperiod control to trigger flowering, coupled with highly dispersible pollen that can easily contaminate nearby female flowers. This study aimed to develop a protocol for in vitro flowering in cannabis, investigate factors affecting in vitro flower production, and generate viable in vitro seeds, potentially offering a method for producing sterile cannabinoids or advancing breeding techniques. We show that the life cycle of cannabis can be fully completed in tissue culture; plantlets readily produce inflorescences and viable seeds in vitro. Our findings highlight the superior performance of DKW medium with 2% sucrose in a filtered vessel and emphasize the need for low light intensity during flower induction to optimize production. The improved performance in filtered vessels suggests that plants conduct photosynthesis in vitro, highlighting the need for future investigations into the effects of forced ventilation to refine this system. All tested lines readily developed inflorescences upon induction, with a 100% occurrence rate, including male flowering. We revealed the non-dehiscent trait of in vitro anthers, which is advantageous as it allows for multiple crosses to be conducted in vitro without concerns about cross-contamination. The current work developed and optimized an effective protocol for in vitro flowering and seed production in cannabis, potentially providing a platform for sterile cannabinoid production and an efficient tool for breeding programs. This system allows for the full and consistent control of plant growth conditions year-round, potentially offering the reliable production of sterile molecules suitable for pharmacological use. As a breeding strategy, this method overcomes the complex challenges of breeding cannabis, such as the need for large facilities, by enabling the production of hundreds of lines in a small facility. By offering precise control over factors such as plant growth regulators, light intensity, photoperiod, and temperature, this system also serves as a valuable tool for studying flowering aspects in cannabis."/>

    <meta property="og:description" content="Background Cannabis sativa L. is a versatile medicinal plant known for its therapeutic properties, derived from its diverse array of secondary metabolites synthesized primarily in female flower organs. Breeding cannabis is challenging due to its dioecious nature, strict regulatory requirements, and the need for photoperiod control to trigger flowering, coupled with highly dispersible pollen that can easily contaminate nearby female flowers. This study aimed to develop a protocol for in vitro flowering in cannabis, investigate factors affecting in vitro flower production, and generate viable in vitro seeds, potentially offering a method for producing sterile cannabinoids or advancing breeding techniques. Results We show that the life cycle of cannabis can be fully completed in tissue culture; plantlets readily produce inflorescences and viable seeds in vitro. Our findings highlight the superior performance of DKW medium with 2% sucrose in a filtered vessel and emphasize the need for low light intensity during flower induction to optimize production. The improved performance in filtered vessels suggests that plants conduct photosynthesis in vitro, highlighting the need for future investigations into the effects of forced ventilation to refine this system. All tested lines readily developed inflorescences upon induction, with a 100% occurrence rate, including male flowering. We revealed the non-dehiscent trait of in vitro anthers, which is advantageous as it allows for multiple crosses to be conducted in vitro without concerns about cross-contamination. Conclusion The current work developed and optimized an effective protocol for in vitro flowering and seed production in cannabis, potentially providing a platform for sterile cannabinoid production and an efficient tool for breeding programs. This system allows for the full and consistent control of plant growth conditions year-round, potentially offering the reliable production of sterile molecules suitable for pharmacological use. As a breeding strategy, this method overcomes the complex challenges of breeding cannabis, such as the need for large facilities, by enabling the production of hundreds of lines in a small facility. By offering precise control over factors such as plant growth regulators, light intensity, photoperiod, and temperature, this system also serves as a valuable tool for studying flowering aspects in cannabis."/>

Breeding cannabis is challenging due to its dioecious nature, strict regulatory requirements, and the need for photoperiod control to trigger flowering, coupled with highly dispersible pollen that can easily contaminate nearby female flowers. This study aimed to develop a protocol for in vitro flowering in cannabis, investigate factors affecting in vitro flower production, and generate viable in vitro seeds, potentially offering a method for producing sterile cannabinoids or advancing breeding techniques.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" data-test="abstract-sub-heading">Results</h3><p>We show that the life cycle of cannabis can be fully completed in tissue culture; plantlets readily produce inflorescences and viable seeds in vitro. Our findings highlight the superior performance of DKW medium with 2% sucrose in a filtered vessel and emphasize the need for low light intensity during flower induction to optimize production. The improved performance in filtered vessels suggests that plants conduct photosynthesis in vitro, highlighting the need for future investigations into the effects of forced ventilation to refine this system. All tested lines readily developed inflorescences upon induction, with a 100% occurrence rate, including male flowering. We revealed the non-dehiscent trait of in vitro anthers, which is advantageous as it allows for multiple crosses to be conducted in vitro without concerns about cross-contamination.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" data-test="abstract-sub-heading">Conclusion</h3><p>The current work developed and optimized an effective protocol for in vitro flowering and seed production in cannabis, potentially providing a platform for sterile cannabinoid production and an efficient tool for breeding programs. This system allows for the full and consistent control of plant growth conditions year-round, potentially offering the reliable production of sterile molecules suitable for pharmacological use. As a breeding strategy, this method overcomes the complex challenges of breeding cannabis, such as the need for large facilities, by enabling the production of hundreds of lines in a small facility. By offering precise control over factors such as plant growth regulators, light intensity, photoperiod, and temperature, this system also serves as a valuable tool for studying flowering aspects in cannabis.</p></div></div></section>

The female cannabis plant exhibits a bushy and robust structure that develops complex inflorescences upon a short photoperiod with numerous small flowers closely packed with high biomass. These inflorescences are primarily located at the tips of the stem and branches and on the leaf axils throughout the plant [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 5" title="Spitzer-Rimon B, et al.

Consequently, the cannabinoid profile among inflorescences within plants varies due to differential light exposure and variations in the source-sink relationship. This variability presents a significant challenge, prompting the adoption of various strategies to reduce these inconsistencies.

In most countries, cannabis is under strict regulation that mandates certain security measures, limits the growing space, and specifies the maximum number of plants; 3. The anemophilous nature of cannabis, relying on wind for pollination, introduces challenges in controlling cross-pollination [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 9" title="Wizenberg SB, Weis AE, Campbell LG.

                        </h3><p>In vitro flowering can serve as a valuable tool for studying specific aspects of flowering in cannabis and for producing important flower components, such as the calyx, to harvest cannabinoids under aseptic conditions. We first followed a standard sterilization protocol to establish our experimental system to introduce explants into tissue culture. We selected stem segment explants from cannabis TA5 cultivar, which was grown in a growth room under an 18/6 h photoperiod (Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13007-024-01265-5#Fig1">1</a>a). Approximately 100 explants were sterilized in a 2% sodium hypochlorite solution (Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13007-024-01265-5#Fig1">1</a>b), then cut into single-node explants, and placed in MS or DKW media as described in the Materials and Methods section, with five single-node sections per vessel (Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13007-024-01265-5#Fig1">1</a>c). The sterilization processes can impose stress on the explants, requiring a recovery period. The stem sections are leafless at this stage, and a few days are required before leaves become apparent. To evaluate the requirement of initial vegetative growth for successful flowering, we compared two photoperiod treatments. Six vessels were subjected to an 18/6 h photoperiod for two weeks (Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13007-024-01265-5#Fig1">1</a>d), before transitioning to a 12/12 h photoperiod to induce flowering (Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13007-024-01265-5#Fig1">1</a>e). Six additional vessels were cultured directly under a 12/12 h photoperiod. The cannabis flower usually has two stigmas (Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13007-024-01265-5#Fig1">1</a>f). To track the number of flowers and their rate of development, we followed the stigma development and counted the number of flowers every few days (Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13007-024-01265-5#Fig1">1</a>g-i). Although the number of flowers developed within 38 days was similar between the two regimes, the plants that were first grown under a vegetative photoperiod appeared more developed. Therefore, we established this regime of two weeks under an 18/6 h cycle before transitioning to flower induction as part of our protocol.</p><div class="c-article-section__figure js-c-reading-companion-figures-item" data-test="figure" data-container-section="figure" id="figure-1" data-title="Fig.&nbsp;1"><figure><figcaption><b id="Fig1" class="c-article-section__figure-caption" data-test="figure-caption-text">Fig.&nbsp;1</b></figcaption><div class="c-article-section__figure-content"><div class="c-article-section__figure-item"><a class="c-article-section__figure-link" data-test="img-link" data-track="click" data-track-label="image" data-track-action="view figure" href="/articles/10.1186/s13007-024-01265-5/figures/1" rel="nofollow"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1186%2Fs13007-024-01265-5/MediaObjects/13007_2024_1265_Fig1_HTML.png?as=webp"><img aria-describedby="Fig1" src="//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1186%2Fs13007-024-01265-5/MediaObjects/13007_2024_1265_Fig1_HTML.png" alt="figure 1" loading="lazy" width="685" height="690"></picture></a></div><div class="c-article-section__figure-description" data-test="bottom-caption" id="figure-1-desc"><p>Tissue culture experimental system for flower induction in cannabis. <b>a</b> Stem segment explants, cut from indoor TA5 plants growing under 18/6 h light/dark photoperiod, were introduced into tissue culture (a white circle marks a node segment). <b>b</b> Stem section explants were surface sterilized in a 2% sodium hypochlorite solution. <b>c</b> The stems were separated into single-node segments, and five explants were cultured in each vessel. <b>d</b> Developed plants at two weeks under an 18/6 h light/dark photoperiod. <b>e</b> Cannabis flowers developed under a 12/12 h cycle to promote flowering.

                        </h3><p>Our results, showing no significant difference between 2 and 3% sucrose concentrations, raise the question of whether the plants in the vessel conduct photosynthesis. To address this, we first examined the presence of stomata, which is essential for gas exchange. Scanning electron microscopy analysis of abaxial fan leaves from plants growing in tissue culture and growth room reveals that leaves in tissue culture develop stomata similar to those in growth room plants (Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/10.1186/s13007-024-01265-5#Fig3">3</a>a).

Subsequently, we tested the plants' capacity for photosynthesis by cultivating stem nodes in a medium devoid of carbon energy sources.

This is supported by the CO₂ level measured within a filtered vessel containing plants, showing values between 150 and 250 mmol/mol during the photoperiod, depending on the number of filters, while the CO₂ concentration in the room was maintained at 350–400 mmol/mol [<a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 36" title="Nguyen QT, Xiao Y, Kozai T.

It might be that losing and gaining back moisture is crucial for pollen grain germination.

Nevertheless, in our setting, although the anther did not dehisce naturally, it released pollen with our assistance, which proved to be viable according to our germination test and the successful fertilization.</p><p>The average number of female flowers produced was six, with an average of 4.4 seeds developing per inflorescence/plant. Low pollen grain viability might have led to incomplete fertilization, preventing some flowers from producing seeds. Another possibility is that the plant's small size could not support extensive seed development. Out of the collected seeds, only an average of 2.4 seeds per plant germinated (Table S1). However, achieving one successful succession per generation is sufficient for a breeding program aimed at hybrid seed production and generating numerous homozygous plants to test various combinations.</p></div></div></section><section data-title="Conclusions"><div class="c-article-section" id="Sec10-section"><h2 class="c-article-section__title js-section-title js-c-reading-companion-sections-item" id="Sec10">Conclusions</h2><div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec10-content"><p>This study has successfully established a method for in vitro flowering induction in cannabis, providing a valuable tool for both research and practical applications.

The improved performance in filtered vessels suggests that plants conduct photosynthesis in vitro, underscoring the need for future investigations into the effects of forced ventilation to refine this system. We show that this method applies to several cultivars and to male flowering as well. Additionally, we use this system to produce viable seeds in vitro.
