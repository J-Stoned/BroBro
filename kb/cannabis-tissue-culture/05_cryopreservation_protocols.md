# Plant Cryopreservation: Long-Term Germplasm Storage Protocols

**Sources:** Comprehensive review of plant cryopreservation literature and protocols

**WHY CRYO MATTERS FOR CANNABIS:**
- HpLVd (Hop Latent Viroid) infects 90% of California cannabis crops
- Constant subculturing risks somaclonal variation and genetic drift  
- Contamination from repeated handling
- Labor-intensive routine maintenance (every 4-8 weeks)
- **Cryopreservation solves ALL these problems**

---

## What is Cryopreservation?

**Definition:** Long-term storage of living plant tissues at ultra-low temperatures (-196°C liquid nitrogen or -140°C nitrogen vapor) where all metabolic processes are suspended.

**Key Principle:** At -196°C:
- ALL biochemical reactions stop
- No aging, no mutation accumulation
- Indefinite storage potential (decades to centuries)
- No maintenance required except liquid nitrogen refills
- Genetic stability perfectly preserved

**The Critical Challenge:** Avoiding ice crystal formation
- Ice crystals puncture cell membranes → cell death
- Solution: Vitrification (cells transition to glass-like state)
- Achieved through cryoprotectants + ultra-rapid cooling

## Why Cryopreservation is Essential for Cannabis

### Problem 1: Routine Subculturing Limitations

**Standard TC Maintenance:**
- Subculture every 4-8 weeks
- Labor: 2-5 minutes per culture
- Cost: $2-5 per transfer
- Contamination risk: 2-5% per cycle
- **Annual cost for 1000 cultures: $12,000-30,000**

**Cryopreservation Advantage:**
- One-time processing
- No maintenance for years/decades
- Zero contamination risk in storage
- **Annual cost: $50-100 (liquid nitrogen only)**

### Problem 2: Genetic Drift

**Subculture Risks:**
- Somaclonal variation accumulates
- After 15-20 passages, genetic changes detectable
- Phenotype may shift from original
- Cannabinoid profiles can change
- **Problem: Cannot maintain true-to-type indefinitely**

**Cryopreservation Advantage:**
- ZERO genetic change during storage
- Time literally stops at -196°C
- Can store 50+ years with perfect fidelity
- Recover exact genetics decades later

### Problem 3: Viroid Elimination

**HpLVd Challenge:**
- 90% of California cannabis infected
- Reduces yield 30-50%
- Spreads through tissue culture easily
- Standard TC cannot eliminate it

**Cryo Solution:**
- Meristem culture + cryotherapy
- Ultra-low temperatures can eliminate viroids
- Combined with thermotherapy before cryo
- Produces certified virus/viroid-free stock

### Problem 4: Backup and Insurance

**What if:**
- Contamination wipes out collection
- Power failure kills cultures
- Fire/disaster destroys lab
- Labor shortage disrupts maintenance

**Cryo Provides:**
- Permanent backup of all genetics
- Geographically distributed storage possible
- Disaster recovery capability
- Peace of mind

## Cryopreservation Methods Overview

### Method 1: Slow Cooling (Classical Method)

**Principle:**
- Controlled gradual temperature reduction
- Allows cells to dehydrate osmotically
- Ice forms outside cells (not inside)
- Avoids intracellular crystal damage

**Protocol:**
1. Preculture: Prime cells for freezing
2. Cryoprotectant loading: DMSO or glycerol
3. Slow cool: 1-2°C per minute to -40°C (programmable freezer)
4. Plunge into liquid nitrogen
5. Store at -196°C

**Advantages:**
- Works for many species
- Well-established protocols
- Moderate equipment needs

**Disadvantages:**
- Requires programmable freezer ($5,000-20,000)
- Time-consuming (several hours)
- Lower success rates (40-70%) for many species

### Method 2: Vitrification (Modern Standard)

**Principle:**
- Ultra-rapid cooling prevents ice formation
- Cells transition to glass-like state (vitrification)
- No ice crystals = no damage
- Much higher success rates

**Basic Protocol:**
1. Preculture in high-sucrose media (0.3-0.5 M)
2. Loading solution: Mild cryoprotectants (15-30 min)
3. Dehydration solution (PVS2 or PVS3): 20-60 minutes
4. Direct plunge into liquid nitrogen (ultra-fast cooling)
5. Store at -196°C

**PVS2 Composition (Most Common):**
- 30% glycerol (w/v)
- 15% ethylene glycol (w/v)
- 15% DMSO (w/v)
- 0.4 M sucrose
- MS salts

**Advantages:**
- NO expensive equipment needed
- Higher success rates (70-95%)
- Faster procedure
- Works for more species
- Industry standard for cannabis


**Disadvantages:**
- Cryoprotectant toxicity (timing critical)
- Must work quickly (dehydration step is time-sensitive)
- Requires practice and skill

### Method 3: Encapsulation-Dehydration

**Principle:**

5. Place directly in liquid nitrogen
6. Store at -196°C

**Advantages:**
- Easy to handle (beads)
- Less toxic than vitrification
- No specialized equipment
- Suitable for large-scale operations

**Disadvantages:**
- Longer protocol
- Success varies by species
- Dehydration timing critical

### Method 4: Droplet Vitrification

**Protocol:**
1. Preculture and loading solution (same as vitrification)
2. Transfer to PVS2 for 20-40 minutes
3. Place explant in tiny droplet (5-10 μL) on aluminum foil
4. Directly plunge foil into liquid nitrogen
5. Transfer to cryovials in liquid nitrogen
6. Store at -196°C

**Advantages:**
- Highest cooling rates achievable
- Often best success rates (80-95%)
- Minimal cryoprotectant exposure
- Works for difficult species

**Disadvantages:**
- Requires steady hands
- Small droplets tricky to manipulate
- More technical skill needed

### Method 5: Cryo-Plate

- 30 g/L sucrose
- 7 g/L agar
- pH 5.8

### Step-by-Step Protocol

**Week -2: Preculture**
1. Select actively growing shoot tips (2-3 mm)
2. Culture on MS + 0.3 M sucrose for 1 week
3. Transfer to MS + 0.5 M sucrose for 1 week
4. **Purpose:** Cold acclimate and increase cell sugar content

**Day of Cryopreservation - Setup:**
1. Cool PVS2 to 0-4°C (ice bath)
2. Prepare aluminum foil strips (2 cm × 5 cm)
3. Pre-chill liquid nitrogen dewar
4. Label cryovials
5. All solutions at room temperature except PVS2

**Step 1: Explant Preparation (30 minutes)**
1. Excise shoot tips under stereo scope
2. Size: 1-2 mm (smaller = better survival)
3. Remove all leaves
4. Place in loading solution
5. Incubate 20 minutes at room temperature
6. **Critical:** Work quickly, tissues dehydrating

**Step 2: Dehydration (30-45 minutes)**
1. Transfer to ice-cold PVS2
2. Incubate at 0°C for 30-45 minutes
3. **Timing critical:** Too short = ice formation, too long = toxicity
4. For cannabis: 35-40 minutes optimal (test for your genotype)
5. Keep on ice entire time

**Step 3: Vitrification (<2 minutes)**
1. Using forceps, transfer one shoot tip to fresh PVS2 droplet (10 μL) on foil
2. Work FAST - maximum 10 seconds per explant
3. Immediately plunge foil strip into liquid nitrogen
4. Hold submerged 1-2 minutes
5. Using pre-cooled forceps, transfer foil strip to cryovial
6. Keep cryovial submerged in liquid nitrogen
7. Repeat for all explants (10-20 per batch recommended)

**Step 4: Storage**
1. Transfer cryovials to storage dewar
2. Maintain at -196°C (submerged) or -140°C (vapor phase)
3. Label clearly with genotype, date, protocol
4. Record in database
5. Store indefinitely

**Recovery Protocol (When needed)**

**Thawing (2-3 minutes):**
1. Remove cryovial from liquid nitrogen
2. Thaw in 40°C water bath: 90-120 seconds
3. **Speed critical:** Slow thawing = ice crystal formation = death
4. Watch for ice to melt completely
5. Immediately proceed to unloading

**Unloading (30 minutes):**
1. Transfer explants to unloading solution (1.2 M sucrose)
2. Incubate 20 minutes at room temperature
3. Rinse in liquid MS medium (no sucrose)
4. **Purpose:** Remove toxic cryoprotectants gradually

**Culture (4-8 weeks):**
1. Place explants on recovery media
2. Low light (20-40 μmol·m⁻²·s⁻¹) for first week
3. Keep in dark for first 24-48 hours
4. Transfer to normal light after 1 week
5. First signs of growth: 1-3 weeks
6. Shoot development: 4-6 weeks
7. Rooting: 6-8 weeks

**Expected Success Rates:**
- 70-90% survival (depends on optimization)
- First attempts: 40-60% normal
- After optimization: 80-95% achievable

## Protocol Optimization for Your Genotype

**Cannabis-specific variables to test:**

**1. PVS2 Exposure Time**
- Test range: 25-50 minutes in 5-minute increments
- Cannabis typical: 30-40 minutes
- Indica vs Sativa may differ
- Keep detailed records by cultivar

**2. Explant Size**
- Smaller = better (less ice formation)
- Test: 0.5 mm, 1 mm, 1.5 mm, 2 mm
- Cannabis sweet spot: 1-1.5 mm
- Balance survival vs regeneration ease

**3. Preculture Duration**
- Standard: 2 weeks (1 week each concentration)
- Test: 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks
- Longer preculture = better cold tolerance
- Cannabis: 2 weeks optimal for most

**4. Sucrose Concentrations**
- Loading solution: 0.5-1.0 M
- Unloading solution: 0.8-1.2 M
- Recovery media: 30-50 g/L
- Optimize for each genotype

**5. Recovery Conditions**
- Initial darkness: 0-72 hours (test)
- Low light duration: 3-14 days
- Hormone concentrations in recovery media
- Cannabis responds to darkness first 24-48 hours

**Systematic Optimization Approach:**
1. Start with standard protocol
2. Test one variable at a time
3. Use 20-30 explants per treatment
4. Record survival and regeneration rates
5. Document timing and quality
6. Refine based on data

## Troubleshooting Common Problems

**Problem: Low Survival (<40%)**

**Possible Causes & Solutions:**

1. **PVS2 too toxic (over-exposure)**
   - Reduce PVS2 time by 5-10 minutes
   - Use colder PVS2 (reduces toxicity)
   - Try PVS3 (less toxic alternative)

2. **Ice formation (under-dehydration)**
   - Increase PVS2 time by 5-10 minutes
   - Ensure PVS2 is ice-cold during treatment
   - Faster plunging into liquid nitrogen

3. **Slow thawing**
   - Must thaw in 90-120 seconds
   - 40°C water bath optimal
   - Never thaw slowly at room temperature

4. **Explants too large**
   - Reduce to 1 mm or smaller
   - Remove ALL leaf tissue
   - Use only meristem dome + 1-2 primordial leaves

**Problem: Browning During Recovery**

**Solutions:**
- Increase activated charcoal (2-3 g/L)
- Add antioxidants (ascorbic acid 50 mg/L)
- Keep in darkness longer (48-72 hours)
- Reduce light intensity first 2 weeks
- Fresh recovery media after 1 week

**Problem: No Regrowth After 4 Weeks**

**Solutions:**
- May need 6-8 weeks (cannabis is slow)
- Check explants viable (still green/white, not brown/black)
- Try different hormone combinations
- Increase BAP to 1-2 mg/L
- Add TDZ 0.1-0.5 μM (stronger)
- Transfer to fresh media

**Problem: Variable Results Between Batches**

**Solutions:**
- Standardize explant selection (only tips in active growth)
- Consistent timing (don't rush or delay steps)
- Temperature control (PVS2 must stay cold)
- Fresh solutions (PVS2 degrades over time)
- Same technician (technique matters)

**Problem: Genotype Won't Survive Cryo**

**Solutions:**
- Extended preculture (3-4 weeks)
- Try encapsulation-dehydration (less toxic)
- Smaller explants
- May need species-specific protocol development
- Some genotypes genuinely recalcitrant

---

## Alternative Method: Reduced Temperature Storage

**For Operations Not Ready for Cryo:**

**Slow-Growth Storage (4°C):**
- Store cultures at 4°C instead of 25°C
- Slows metabolism and growth dramatically
- Extends subculture intervals: 4-8 weeks → 6-12 months
- Lower maintenance costs
- Simpler than cryopreservation

**Protocol:**
1. Transfer cultures to low-growth media:
   - Reduced sucrose (10-20 g/L)
   - Lower hormones (50% normal)
   - Higher agar (10 g/L - limits water)
   - Optional: Mannitol or sorbitol (osmotic stress)

2. Seal vessels well (prevent desiccation)

3. Store at 4-6°C in darkness or low light

4. Check monthly (should stay green, minimal growth)

5. Recover by transferring to normal media + conditions

**Cannabis Application:**
- Works well for short-medium term (6-18 months)
- Survival rates: 85-95%
- Lower risk than cryopreservation
- Good stepping stone to full cryo program
- Still requires monitoring and space
