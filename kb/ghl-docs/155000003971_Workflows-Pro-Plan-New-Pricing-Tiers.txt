What Is the Workflow Pro Plan?
The Workflow Pro Plan is an add‑on subscription specifically for managing premium workflow triggers and actions. It sits alongside your main GoHighLevel plan (such as Agency Pro or Agency Unlimited) and handles only the extra‑cost executions. With Workflow Pro, agencies can bulk‑purchase premium triggers and actions at a discounted rate, then resell or allocate those executions to their sub‑accounts. This separation ensures that your core platform features (CRM, website builders, base automation workflows) remain on your primary plan, while all premium workflow costs are consolidated and controlled through the Pro add‑on.
Key Benefits of Workflow Pro Plan
Scale-friendly savings:
Pick a tier that fits your volume; higher tiers include more executions and
lower overage rates
Simple resale/markup workflows:
If your account supports rebilling, you can pass through or mark up Premium Action usage to sub-accounts while keeping a single source of truth for usage.
Predictable baseline + flexible overage:
A flat monthly fee covers your included executions, and transparent overages apply automatically if you go beyond the bundle.
Consolidated billing:
All Premium Triggers/Actions, Marketplace Apps, and LC Apps are billed together, separate from your core subscription.

How Executions & Overages Work
An
execution
is a premium action run. This includes executions from Premium Triggers/Actions, Marketplace apps, and LC Apps. Standard (non‑premium) and external AI model workflow steps do
not
count toward your monthly execution allowance.
Each month, your included executions
reset according to your billing cycle
.
If you exceed your monthly included executions, additional usage is billed at your tier’s
overage rate
.
If you’re on the
Free
plan (no subscription), once the
100 lifetime executions
are used, further usage is billed
$0.01 per execution
each month, or you can upgrade to a tier at any time.
Plan Details
Subscription Plan:
Agencies can purchase plan tiers which gives them a set of monthly premium executions.
Validity & resets:
Executions
reset at the time of payment
. Upgrading mid-cycle carries your unused executions forward until the next billing cycle.
Scope of usage:
Applies to
Premium Triggers
,
Premium Actions
,
Marketplace Apps
, and
LC Apps
used within workflows.
No rollover:
Unused executions
do not
carry over. Only mid-cycle plan changes carry forward executions until the next billing cycle.
Overages:
Once you reach the included amount, executions
continue
and are billed at the plan’s overage rate.
No plan required:
If you don’t subscribe, you can still run Premium Actions at
$0.01/execution
after the 100 free lifetime executions (per sub-account).
Counting unit:
Free lifetime executions are
per sub-account
.

Current Pro Plan users will be automatically moved to the Starter tier ($10/month) — no action required.
