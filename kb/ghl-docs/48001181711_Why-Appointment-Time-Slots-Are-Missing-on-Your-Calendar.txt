What is Time Slot Visibility in HighLevel?
Time slot visibility refers to whether or not appointment booking slots appear to your clients on your public calendar. These slots are determined by a combination of factors—calendar settings, user availability, buffer times, external conflicts, and Round Robin logic. When something’s misconfigured, you may run into issues like:
A user is available but their time slots are missing
Time ranges are open but not bookable
The calendar shows more (or fewer) times than expected
Understanding how these variables interact is essential to diagnosing the issue.
Key Benefits of Understanding Time Slot Visibility
Knowing how calendar logic works helps you reduce missed bookings, improve user experience, and troubleshoot faster.

How to Troubleshoot Missing or Unexpected Time Slots
Time slot issues can result from multiple overlapping factors. Use the grouped checklist below to methodically diagnose and correct visibility problems.
Calendar Settings
Calendar configurations are the foundation of availability logic. Incorrect selections here are a common cause of visibility issues.
Check that you're viewing the correct calendar.
Go to
Calendars > Calendar Settings
. Click
Edit
on desired calendar. Confirm you are working inside the intended calendar by checking calendar name, calendar group and calendar type.
Verify working hours and custom date availability
Click
Edit
on the desired calendar. Visit the calendar's
Availability
tab and confirm that:
Weekly hours are properly set.
Date-specific overrides haven’t blocked times.
Learn more about availability settings.
Confirm the correct user(s) or team is assigned
Availability is based on the assigned users. Check under Team Members Assigned by clicking edit on desired calendar then using the dropdown named
Select
Te
am Member & Assign Meeting Location
in the Service Details tab.
Slot Duration, Buffers & Interval Settings
How your slots are spaced—and buffered—can create gaps or block slots entirely.
Check your slot interval, duration and buffer settings.
These control how often time slots appear and how long they are. To edit, Go to
Settings
→
Calendars
. Click on the calendar you want to edit. In the calendar editor, navigate to the
A
vailability
tab. Scroll to the

External Conflicts & Calendar Sync
Connected calendars can block availability based on busy times. Check for events blocking slots in synced Google/Outlook calendars.
External calendar events—if marked busy—will block slots on the internal calendar.

Timezones
Timezone mismatches are a hidden but common issue, especially across teams or international clients.
Make sure all timezones align
Double-check both your user profile settings and the client’s calendar view to make sure A 3 PM slot for one user could be 10 AM for another.
