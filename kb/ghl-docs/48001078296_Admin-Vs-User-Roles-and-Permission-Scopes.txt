Frequently Asked Questions
Q. Can an Agency Admin restrict a Sub-Account Admin from accessing certain features?
No. Agency Admins cannot customize Sub-Account Admin role permissions directly. Sub-Account Admins always inherit full access within their assigned sub-account. To limit scope, create a
User
role instead of an Admin role in that sub-account.
Q. If a permission is available at both Agency and Sub-Account levels, does the Agency Admin override Sub-Account Admins?
Yes. Agency Admins hold global authority. For permissions like user management, reporting, or media library, Agency Admin actions apply across all sub-accounts, while Sub-Account Admins manage only within their assigned sub-account.
Q. What happens if a user is added at the Agency level and then also given access to a Sub-Account?
The user will have
two role scopes
: agency-wide access from their Agency role, plus sub-account-specific access from their Sub-Account role. Permissions don’t cancel out—they stack, with the broader Agency permissions always taking precedence.
