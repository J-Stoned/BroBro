What is Decline Documents Feature?
The
Decline Documents
feature in HighLevel applies to files created and shared through the
Documents & Contracts
tool, such as proposals, agreements, and contracts. Instead of leaving a document unsigned, recipients can formally decline it by selecting a predefined reason or adding custom notes. Business users can also mark a document as declined to keep records accurate. Once this action is taken, the document status changes to
Declined
, ensuring clear communication and structured feedback.
After a decline action, the document automatically moves to the
Archived
section, where it can no longer be signed but remains stored with full historical details. Users can review who declined the document, when it happened, and why, giving teams actionable insights. This not only improves accountability but also enables workflow automation and better follow-up strategies.
