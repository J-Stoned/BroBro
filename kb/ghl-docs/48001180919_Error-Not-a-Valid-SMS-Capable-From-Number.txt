Frequently Asked Questions
What is the Error: Not a Valid SMS-Capable “From” Number
This error appears when an outbound SMS/MMS is attempted from a number that isn’t eligible to send SMS for the selected destination, account, or configuration. The most common root causes are: the number isn’t SMS‑capable, it’s not on your account/location, it’s not linked to an approved A2P campaign (US 10DLC), or the From value is misconfigured (e.g., invalid format or incompatible sender type).
Quick Fix Checklist
Verify the
From number
belongs to this sub‑account/location and is SMS‑capable.
Use E.164 format in the From field (e.g., +15551234567).
For
US 10DLC
, make sure the number is attached to an approved A2P campaign (Messaging Service → attached numbers).
If using a Short Code, the To and From must be in the
same country
.
If using an Alphanumeric Sender ID, confirm the destination country supports it.
If you manage numbers in
Twilio Console
, ensure the number is capable and owned by your account (not another Master account).
Tip:
If this error started after a recent move or configuration change, re‑check number ownership (agency vs. sub‑account), campaign assignments, and any Messaging Service changes.
Common Causes & How to Resolve
1. Phone Number is not SMS‑capable
Some phone numbers are voice‑only or don’t support SMS in certain countries.
LC Phone:
Go to
Settings → Phone Numbers
, open the number, and confirm
Messaging
is enabled.
Twilio:
In Console, open the number and verify that
Capabilities
include
SMS
.
Fix:
Use an SMS‑capable number or purchase/assign one that supports messaging.
Tip
: For using the Phone Number Assignment Feature, refer to:
How to use this phone assignment feature for SMS/Voice capable only
.
2. The number isn’t valid for your account/destination
The
From
must be a number
owned by (or hosted to)
your account and valid for the target country.
Short Codes:
Must be in the
same country
as the destination.
Hosted/Trial/other account numbers:
Not valid until fully owned and SMS‑enabled on your account.
Fix:
Send from a number on your account that’s allowed for the destination.
3. A2P 10DLC (US) configuration missing or wrong
US local 10DLC numbers must be tied to an
approved A2P campaign
.
LC Phone:
Confirm the number is linked to your approved
Brand/Campaign
.
Twilio:
Attach the number to the correct
Messaging Service
that’s tied to the approved campaign.
Fix:
Complete A2P registration and link the number; retry after approval.
4. Formatting or sender type issues
E.164 required:
Use
+
and country code.
Alphanumeric Sender ID:
Only supported in specific countries (not US/CA person‑to‑person).
Fix:
Correct the
From
format or choose a supported sender type for the destination.
5. Number recently moved or not in this Location
If the number was
moved between sub‑accounts
or providers, the
From
selector or automations may still reference the old number.
Fix:
Re‑select the active number in
Conversations
,
Campaigns/Workflows
, and
Messaging settings
.
Special Cases
Toll‑Free (US/CA):
Requires
Toll‑Free Verification
for reliable delivery. If unverified, messages may fail or be filtered.
International:
Some countries block A2P from long codes; use
Alphanumeric Sender ID
(if supported) or an approved sender per country rules.
Different Master Twilio account:
If your number lives under a different
Master
account, it isn’t valid for this account’s sends. Move it first or send from a number on this account.
Frequently Asked Questions
Q. Does this error mean the number is suspended?
Not necessarily. It usually means the number cannot send SMS for the current configuration. Check capability, ownership, and A2P linking.
Q. Can I send from a short code to another country?
No. Short codes are
country‑specific
; use a local short code for the destination country or another supported sender type.
Q. We just ported/added a number and still see this error—why?
Provisioning or campaign linking can take time. Confirm SMS capability and, for the US, that the number is attached to your approved campaign.
