Importing Contacts using CSV File Format
Importing contacts into HighLevel is the fastest way to bring your leads, clients, or customer lists into the platform. Whether you're switching from another CRM, onboarding new clients, or setting up your first marketing campaign, the import tool lets you upload and organize contacts quickly using a simple CSV file. You can also choose to import opportunities simultaneously, making your pipeline setup even smoother.
Step 1:
Navigate to the Contacts Tab
From the navigation toolbox, click on the
Import Contacts
button.
Step 2:
Select What to Import
Choose whether you’re importing only
Contacts
or both Contacts and Opportunities.
Step 3:
Upload Your CSV File
After selecting to import Contacts, click Next, then upload your CSV file and select the correct import type depending on whether you’re adding new contacts or updating existing ones.
Note
: When updating contacts, HighLevel checks for existing records based on the following order:
Contact ID → Email → Phone.
This matching order ensures accurate updates and avoids duplicates.

Step 4:
Mapping Column to Fields
Ensure each column in your file is correctly mapped to the corresponding field in the system. A few things to note:
Checking the "Don't update Empty Values" checkbox will not update any field if the imported file has empty values and the field does have some value for the opportunity.
If you decide not to import a certain field, you can choose to keep it unmapped and check the box on the bottom to proceed. -"Please ensure all mandatory fields are mapped. To proceed, either map all fields or choose Don't import data for unmapped columns."
If Contacts and Opportunities are on the same line in the CSV, they will be automatically mapped to each other.
Step 5
: Verify, Confirm, and Finalize Selection
Finalize the setup by reviewing your preferences, checking field mappings, and confirming consent before starting the import. This final step ensures that contacts are correctly tagged, sorted, and added to workflows, with your data fully verified.
Preferences
: Optional Actions Before Import
Create a SmartList for new contacts
Add imported contacts to a workflow
Tag imported contacts for easy segmentation
Review your Field Mapping. Make sure all
mandatory fields
are correctly mapped. Confirm that
custom fields
are assigned as intended. Optional: Unmapped columns will be ignored automatically.
Optional: Import Contacts & Opportunities
If your CSV includes both contact and deal (opportunity) information, you can import both at once using the same flow. This is especially useful if you're onboarding new leads directly into your sales pipeline and want to associate them with a stage or deal value during the import. The process remains exactly the same as importing contacts, the only difference is selecting both "Contacts" and "Opportunities" during the initial import setup.
After clicking the
Import
button on the Contacts page, you’ll be prompted to select objects to import. Simply check both and proceed with the same steps as stated above.
Tip
: Your CSV must include Opportunity-related columns (e.g., Pipeline, Stage, Status, Opportunity Name) for that data to be created correctly. You can leave fields unmapped if not needed.
Monitor Import Status
You can monitor the progress and status of the import via the Contacts and Opportunities
Bulk Actions
Pages.
Both contacts and opportunities imports will appear in the same place under
Bulk Actions.
Click on the "
Show Stats
" button to view the Stats of the import - you can also download the error log and view further details about the error and how to fix them in the "
Error
" tab.
