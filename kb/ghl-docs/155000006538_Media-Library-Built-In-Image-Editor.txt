What is the Built-In Image Editor in Media Library?

It focuses on essential adjustments that marketers and teams routinely need, helping you prep images right before publishing without downloading files or opening third‑party apps. The editor opens from any image in the Media Library after you click Edit, rendering a modal with tools for crop, rotate, flip, brightness, and contrast, plus undo/redo and save options.
