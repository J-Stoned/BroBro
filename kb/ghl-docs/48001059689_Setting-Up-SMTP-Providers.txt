If you choose to use SMTP you do so at your own discretion, while we offer support it will be done on a best effort basis. SMTP is considered an advanced use case for experts and not how most people should be sending email through HighLevel.

Sender Email Address Configuration Limitation
when Using Your Own SMTP Provider:
If you are using an SMTP provider, make sure the sender email you mask here matches the email you integrated with.
Learn more on how to configure the sender's email address here
. If the sender's email does not match with the SMTP integrated email, or if the sender's email is not verified with your SMTP provider, it will fail to deliver.
To test if the integrated SMTP integration work:
When sending an email, we will need to update the sender's email address so it matches the integrated SMTP email.
In manual conversation, the sender email is set to be the user login email, we will need to set the email below to match with the SMTP integrated email. By default it will show your login email here:
Daily limits on how many emails can be sent:
Your SMTP provider may have daily limits on how many emails can be sent.
Gmail, for example, has a limit of approximately 100-150 emails per day when connected to the server from a remote email client
.

In regard to setting up Outlook / Microsoft Office 365:
It is common to get the error Authentication unsuccessful even though the two-step verification is OFF. Microsoft changed its security. Now a third-party app requires SMTP Authentication to be enabled. Here is the guide to enabling SMTP >

FAQs:
Q: The "Add Service" button is missing in the Email Services > SMTP services tab, how do I fix this?
A: Switch to Agency View >
Sub-accounts >
Click on the three dots >
Manage Client
Click on
Advanced Settings
>
Make sure the "Disable the Add Email Service button in the sub-account Email Services Settings" is off
Q: How many SMTP service providers can we have on a sub-account?
A: A sub-account can have multiple SMTP service providers. However, the same SMTP credentials cannot be added more than once, so using the same email ID with different integrations is not allowed. Additionally, the same provider (e.g., Gmail) cannot be added twice.
