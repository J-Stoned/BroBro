What are Survey Submissions?
Survey submissions are records of answers provided by contacts who fill out your surveys. These submissions are stored in HighLevel's Submissions tab under the Surveys section and are also integrated into the contact's profile depending on the fields used.

Frequently Asked Questions
Q: Can I trigger automation based on survey answers?
Yes, use the "Survey Submitted" trigger in workflows to start automations.
Q: Do survey answers show up in the CRM automatically?
If the survey includes fields that match contact properties (e.g., email), those fields will update the contact record.
Q: Can multiple submissions from the same contact be tracked?
Yes, all submissions are tracked independently—even if a contact submits the same survey multiple times. This is useful for recurring feedback or event check-ins.
Q: Can I see which survey a response belongs to if I use multiple surveys?
Yes, each submission record shows the name of the associated survey and you can filter results by survey name using the dropdown.
