⭐️ Overview
Badges are a lightweight, visual way to recognise milestones, progress, and engagement. While we’re actively working on a dedicated
“Issue Badge”
action, you can start issuing badges
right now
using the existing
“Issue Certificate”
workflow action.
Yes —
Badges are issued through the same action as Certificates
!
⚙️ How It Works
You can combine any of the supported
workflow triggers
with the existing
“Issue Certificate”
action to send a
Badge
automatically to your customers.
✅ Just select a
Badge template
instead of a Certificate when using the "Issue Certificate" action.

action supports both

seamlessly.
