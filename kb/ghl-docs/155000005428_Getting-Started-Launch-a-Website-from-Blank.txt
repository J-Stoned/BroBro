Preparation & Planning
Before you even log into GoHighLevel or drag your first element, taking some time to plan your website will save you significant time and effort, and result in a much more effective site.
Define Your Website's
Purpose
:
What is the primary goal of this website? Is it to generate leads, sell products, provide information, build brand awareness, or book appointments? Knowing this will guide all your design and content decisions.
Who is your target audience? Understanding their needs, preferences, and pain points will help you tailor the website's content and design to resonate with them.
Outline Your
Content & Structure
:
What pages do you need? Most business websites start with a Home, About, Services/Products, and Contact page. You might need more or fewer depending on your goals.
What key information or call-to-action needs to be on each page? Think about what you want visitors to do or learn on each page.
Gather your assets: Do you have your logo, brand colors, images, videos, and written content (or at least an idea of it) ready?

Plan
