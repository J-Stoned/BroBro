Why Add Files to Contacts?
Adding files to contacts in GoHighLevel allows you to store important documents directly within the contact profile, such as contracts, invoices, and notes. This feature streamlines client management by keeping all essential files organized and easily accessible.
HighLevel provides two methods to upload files to a contact:
Directly via the contact profile.
Using a custom field for file uploads.
Key Considerations Before Creating a Custom Field
When setting up a custom file upload field in GoHighLevel, you have several important options to configure for better organization and functionality. These options determine how the field behaves, where it appears, and what type of files it can handle.

Once saved, this field will appear in the
Custom Fields Section
of the selected object (e.g., contact profile).
Upload Files to a Contact Using a Custom Field
In HighLevel, the ability to upload files to a contact is only available after creating a custom field of the
File Upload
type. Once the custom field is created, you can navigate to the contact's profile to upload, view, or delete files directly within the designated field.
Step 1:
Create a Custom Field Called File Upload
A custom field must be created as it is not available by default; only after creating it can the field be seen and used under the Contact section.
Go to
Settings
from the left-hand menu and select
Custom Fields,
then
c
lick the
Add Custom Field
button. Choose the
File Upload
field type from the available options. Give the field a descriptive name (e.g., "Contract Upload" or "Client Document") and finally save the custom field.
Step 2:
Add a File to a Contact
Once the custom field is created, follow these steps to upload a file to a contact. If you have multiple custom fields created, search the Custom Field inside the Group Tab.
Go to the
Contacts
section from the left-hand menu and select the contact you want to update. In the
Custom Fields Section
of the contact's profile, locate the file upload field you created.
Step 3:
Upload a File
Once the custom field is visible in the Contact's profile, you can upload the desired file directly into the field by selecting and confirming the file from your device.
Scroll to the
Custom Fields
section of the contact's profile and locate the file upload field you created earlier. Click
Upload File
and select a file from your device and confirm the upload to store the file within the contact's profile.
After uploading a file to the custom field, you can
Manage
it directly from the Contact’s profile. To
View
the file, simply click on the file link in the custom field to open and review it. If you need to
Delete
a file, it can be removed from the field or replaced by uploading a new one. In case of accidental deletion, an
Undo
option will appear immediately, allowing you to restore the file quickly and effortlessly.
