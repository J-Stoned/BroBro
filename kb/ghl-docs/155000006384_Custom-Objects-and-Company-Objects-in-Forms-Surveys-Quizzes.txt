What They Are
Custom Objects
let you collect structured, business-specific data that doesn’t fit into standard contact fields — for example,
Properties
,
Pets
, or
Vehicles
. This data links back to contacts so you can organize your CRM around what matters most to your business.
The
Company Object
is a built-in object focused on
business-level data
(like client organizations, agencies, or vendors). It helps you connect multiple contacts under one company.
Think of it this way:
Use
Custom Objects
to track
anything unique to your process or industry
.
Use the
Company Object
to track
who the contact works for or represents
.
What You Can Do
Add fields from your custom objects (text, number, date, dropdown, etc.).
Link data directly to contacts (one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many).
Automatically sync data updates across linked records.
Use custom object fields in
forms, surveys, and quizzes
.
Prevent setup issues by limiting each builder to one object type.
Protect important “primary fields” to avoid breaking associations.
Company Object specifics:
Comes with some default fields like
Name
,
Phone
, and
Email
.
Company Name
acts as the primary key automatically.
Can be used with
Contacts only
, and each contact can have
only one company association
.
Accessible from contact records, making it easy to see linked company info.
Custom Object flexibility:
You define the fields and the primary field.
Can support
multiple associations per contact
.
Lets you model specialized data that doesn’t belong to Companies, Contacts, or Opportunities.
How to Use Them
Go to
Settings > Custom Objects
to create or manage custom objects.
For Companies, go to
Settings > Companies
(already built-in).
Open the
Form, Survey, or Quiz Builder
.
You can add fields
within the builder only.
Choose how the object connects to the contact (association settings).
The system automatically adds the primary field.
Add more fields of the same object type.
Save and publish — submissions now link the contact and the object.
Best Practices
Use only
one object type per form/survey/quiz
.
Configure the
association
as soon as you add a custom object field.
Define a
primary field
for custom objects — the system will use the first one if missing.
For Companies, remember the primary key (Company Name) is already set.
Keep object names simple and consistent to avoid confusion.
Avoid using Company or Custom Object fields together in the same builder.
Works Best For
Custom Objects:
Industry-specific tracking (e.g., properties, pets, vehicles, cases, or assets).
Company Object:
B2B relationships — linking multiple contacts under one business.
Keeping structured, consistent, and connected data across your CRM.
Won’t Work For
Mixing multiple object types in a single form.
Bulk updates or advanced reporting (not yet supported).
Creating or sharing forms/surveys/quizzes with Company or Custom Object fields via the Template Library.
Sharing custom fields or custom objects across sub-accounts.
Adding custom values to custom object fields (not supported).
Quick Fixes
Association not loading?
Check your internet or object setup.
Mixed object error?
Remove old object fields before adding new ones.
Primary field missing?
Define one in settings; the system uses the first field if none exists.
Removed primary field?
All fields will be cleared from the builder — re-add manually.
Company not showing under contact?
Make sure the company exists in
Settings > Companies
.
Examples
Real Estate:
Create a Custom Object for “Properties” to store location, size, and price. Each record can link to multiple contacts (tenants, buyers, or owners).
Veterinary Clinic:
Use a Custom Object for “Pets” — each pet record links to the owner’s contact and includes breed, medical notes, and vaccination data.
Agency or B2B Setup:
Use the Company Object to store business-level info like company name, phone, and billing address. Then associate multiple client contacts with that company.
In Short
Custom Objects
let you structure your CRM data however your business needs — flexible, scalable, and built for customization.
The Company Object
is simpler — a fixed structure for managing organizations and their related contacts.
Use both together to get a complete view of your relationships:
Custom Objects
for specialized data.
Company Object
for business-level connections.
Clean, linked, and purpose-driven CRM data — all in one place.
