Frequently Asked Questions
What is Sticky Contact?
Sticky Contact is a feature in HighLevel forms that uses cookies to store and retrieve data previously entered by a user. This allows fields like name, email, or phone number to be pre-filled on subsequent visits, providing a smoother user experience.
This mimics autofill functionality, but it works directly within the HighLevel system to enhance consistency and user experience.
Sticky Contact is especially valuable in use cases like
recurring event sign-ups
, where returning attendees can quickly re-enter without having to type their details again, and
customer portals
, where frequent users benefit from faster navigation and order management thanks to automatically populated forms. By minimizing friction, Sticky Contact supports better engagement and higher form completion rates.
⛔
DON'T use Sticky Contact if:
- Your internal team members are filling out a form/survey/calendar widget on behalf of your customers.
- Multiple customers are going to fill out the same form at a kiosk or something similar.
In these scenarios, Sticky Contact will continuously overwrite the contact record of the first submission with the details from the next submission because the saved data is all on a single device, either your team member's computer or at the kiosk.
For scenarios where you want to have internal team members completing forms or booking appointments on behalf of customers, it's best to disable Sticky Contacts or just make the updates directly in the Contact Record.

Frequently Asked Questions
Q: Can Sticky Contact work across subdomains?
No, Sticky Contact data is domain-specific. It cannot pre-fill forms across different subdomains.
Q: What happens if a user clears their cookies?
If cookies are deleted, Sticky Contact will no longer retain previously entered data, and fields will not be pre-filled.
Q: Is Sticky Contact GDPR-compliant?
Yes, but it’s essential to inform users about cookie usage and provide opt-out options to comply with data protection laws.
Q: Does Sticky Contact interfere with browser autofill?
No, Sticky Contact operates independently of browser autofill. However, the two can complement each other for a seamless user experience.
Q: Sticky Contact isn’t showing in my calendar settings—why?
If you’re using a custom form for calendar bookings, the Sticky Contact setting will not appear in calendar settings. Instead, you must enable Sticky Contact on the custom form itself. The calendar will honor Sticky Contact data stored by that form.
