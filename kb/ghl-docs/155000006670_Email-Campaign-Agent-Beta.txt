What is Email Campaign Agent?
Email Campaign Agent is an
Ask AI–powered flow
you access by
prompting Ask AI
with phrases like “Create an email campaign” or “Email to promote my product.” Ask AI then launches a guided, step‑by‑step builder that assembles your campaign—on‑brand copy, subject‑line tests, audience selection, and sending‑domain checks—directly inside the Campaign Builder.
Key Benefits of Email Campaign Agent
A focused overview of why teams use this tool and how it accelerates results. Use these benefits to align on value, set expectations, and help stakeholders understand what improves deliverability and engagement.

: Draft complete emails with Ask AI and your Brand Voice to reduce blank‑page time while staying consistent.
Faster experimentation
: Generate multiple subject lines and run a built‑in A/B test to improve opens and clicks.
Accurate targeting
: Pick from dynamic
Segments
,
Smart Lists
, tags, or pre‑built segments to reach the right audience.

dedicated sending domain
with auto‑configure or manual DNS, plus

On‑Brand Email Copy with Ask AI
This capability uses Content AI and your Brand Voice to convert a short brief into complete email copy. You can fine‑tune tone and intent, regenerate, or edit directly—so AI speeds you up without locking you in.
Launch Ask AI from the campaign draft to generate body copy based on your prompt and tone.

; require
at least 10 contacts per variation
and
40 contacts total
.

Unique Open Rate

Audience Targeting Options
Selecting the right audience is as important as the message. Email Campaign Agent supports multiple targeting methods so you can balance speed with precision.
•
Segments (campaign builder)
– Real‑time, logic‑based groups built from engagement, tags, and fields; evaluated dynamically and reusable across campaigns.
•
Pre‑Built Segments
– One‑click picks like “Engaged last 7/30/60 days” or “Interacted with last 5 campaigns.” These snapshot at creation/scheduling time.
•
Smart Lists (Contacts → Smart Lists)
– Dynamic CRM views that update at
send time
; new matches are included and non‑matches are excluded.
•
Tags
– Use existing tags or add on the Send/Schedule page to organize audiences and automate downstream.
