What Is the Default Naming Convention for New SaaS Sub-Accounts?
This setting defines the
default naming convention
used when HighLevel creates a
new SaaS sub-account
during checkout. Agencies can pick
Company Name
(the business provided during checkout) or keep the traditional
Customer Name + ’s Account
format. The choice applies to
future
sign-ups and does
not
rename existing accounts.
Note:
This option lives in the
SaaS Configurator
at the Agency level and is available to agencies with
SaaS Mode
on the
Agency Pro ($497) plan
. If you’re on Starter or Freelancer, upgrade to
Agency Pro
to access SaaS Configurator features.
Key Benefits of Default Naming Convention for New SaaS Subscribers
Improved Clarity:
Sub-account names reflect the operating business rather than only the buyer’s personal name.
Enhanced Client Experience:
Reduces manual post-onboarding updates by applying your preferred naming automatically.
Operational Efficiency:
Makes accounts easier to search, filter, and recognize for support and success teams.
Flexible Options:
Switch between
Company Name
and
Customer Name + ’s Account
to match your internal workflow.
How To Setup Default Naming Convention for New SaaS Subscribers
Open
SaaS Configurator
→
Advanced Settings
→
Sub-Account
Onboarding
.
Under
Sub-Account Onboarding
, choose one:
Company Name
(recommended for business-forward clarity), or
Customer Name + ’s Account
(useful if your team searches primarily by owner).
Click
Save
. New SaaS sub-accounts created via HighLevel funnels (and supported external checkouts) will now follow your selection.
Naming Convention Options
Review what each option does so you can align the default with how your team identifies and supports new customers.
Company Name
— Uses the
business name
provided at checkout so the sub-account clearly represents the client’s brand.
Example:
Acme Dental
Customer Name + ’s Account
— Uses the buyer’s personal name with
’s Account
appended.
Example:
Jane Smith’s Account
Note:
If the Company Name field is not present or is left empty during checkout, HighLevel defaults to Customer Name + ’s Account.
External Checkout Integration
You can extend the same naming behavior
beyond
HighLevel funnel checkouts by passing the client’s business name from your external checkout into HighLevel as metadata.
Ensure your external checkout sends a
non-empty
companyName
subscription metadata
value.
Keep the SaaS Configurator set to
Use Company Name
to apply the business name when metadata is present.
If
companyName
is missing or empty, HighLevel falls back to
Customer Name + ’s Account
.
Example metadata payload (illustrative):
{
"subscription"
:
{
"metadata"
:
{
"companyName"
:
"Acme Dental"
}
}
}
Behavior & Examples
These quick examples clarify what you and your clients will see after signup so expectations are aligned.
If “Company Name” is selected and provided at checkout:
Resulting sub-account:
Acme Dental
If “Company Name” is selected but not provided:
Resulting sub-account:
Jane Smith’s Account
(fallback to customer name)
If “Customer Name + ’s Account” is selected:
Resulting sub-account:
Jane Smith’s Account
Note:
After Account Creation admins can update the
Location’s Friendly Business Name
later if needed. Changing this later does not retroactively change past confirmations or emails already sent.
Frequently Asked Questions
Q:
Does this setting affect existing SaaS accounts?
No. It applies only to
new
SaaS sign-ups after you save the setting.
Q:
What happens if no Company Name is provided during checkout?
HighLevel defaults to
Customer Name + ’s Account
.
Q: Can we change the default later?
Yes. Update the option in
SaaS Configurator
at any time. It applies to
future
sign-ups.
Q:
How do we enable this for external checkouts?
Send a
non-empty
companyName
in subscription metadata and keep the setting on
Use Company Name
.
Q:
Will changing the setting rename previously created accounts?
No. There’s no retroactive renaming.
Q: Does this influence merge fields like
{{location.name}}
in communications?
The initial Location name reflects the chosen convention at creation. Messages using
{{location.name}}
will display that name unless it’s edited later in the Location settings.
Q:
Could unusual characters in Company Name cause issues?
Use standard alphanumeric characters where possible for best results. If a name is not accepted by your external checkout or looks incorrect, edit the Location name after creation.
