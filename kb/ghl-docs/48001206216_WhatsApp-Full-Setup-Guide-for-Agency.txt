Pre-requisites for Auto-Reselling
Connect Your Agency Stripe Account
To resell WhatsApp, you need to connect your
agency's Stripe account
, which will be used to collect subscription payments from your clients.
? Follow this guide to connect Stripe:
How to Connect Stripe to Your Agency Dashboard
?
Don’t have Stripe?
You can still
deploy WhatsApp
without using the auto-reselling feature. However, in this case, your agency will be directly billed instead of charging the client.

, you can do so by following these two steps:

Step 2:
Scroll down to the reselling section -> Under WhatsApp -> Read and Accept Deploy WA directly T&C -> Hit pay Now
Please note:
WhatsApp tab won’t be visible for the location until this manual deployment takes place(in case agency does not have a Stripe account). It’s important to highlight that manual deployment won’t establish a subscription between the location and agency, while subscriptions with GHL and the agency will still be created.
Conversation Charges
In case agency choses Deploy WhatsApp Directly, then the
WhatsApp conversation charges
will be deducted from the agency's wallet and location will not be charged for the WhatsApp conversations.
How to Check Your HighLevel Billing and Subscriptions for WhatsApp
To review how much you are paying to HighLevel and for which accounts, follow these steps:
Step 1: Access Billing Information
Navigate to
Agency Settings
→
Billing
→
Subscription
→
Reselling WhatsApp
.
Step 2:  Scroll Down > View Sub-Accounts
Click on
"Show Sub-Accounts"
to display a detailed list of all sub-accounts associated with WhatsApp.
How do your clients discover the Whatsaap feature?
Your clients can discover WhatsApp in the Sub-Account > Settings > WhatsApp
How do your Clients complete the purchase?
Once clients discover the WhatsApp feature, they can easily purchase it by entering their payment details and clicking the
Confirm
button. Upon confirmation, our system automatically processes the payment and sets up the required subscriptions.
Important Note:
Two separate subscriptions will be created:
Step 1:
Between GoHighLevel and the Agency
Step 2:
Between the Agency and the Sub-Account
After completing the purchase, clients will be redirected to the WhatsApp signup page, where they can seamlessly integrate their WhatsApp account.
How does the billing work?
When your client purchases WhatsApp it creates 2 subscriptions in the System
Between your client's card & your Stripe Account so you can collect payment from your clients
Between HighLevel & your Stripe account, you pay $10/month/location to HighLevel
The monthly charge gets you free inbound and outbound messages. When the lead sends an inbound text it gives you a 24-hour window when you can text them back. The window keeps extending with every message.
If you need to do outreach or if it's been more than 24 hours you will need to use a campaign/template message which is charged. That opens the conversation up for 24 hour window which again keeps extending with every message
All the outbound template messages will be charged to the location and agency based on the Country the message is sent to and the type of Template [Marketing, Utility, Authentication and Services] used. Attached is the list for reference.
