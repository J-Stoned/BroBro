Manage Dashboard Permissions
Set Permissions On A New Dashboard
Step 1: Add A Dashboard
Navigate to Dashboard, click on the Dashboard Selection menu (blue), then click on Add Dashboard.
Step 2: Select Blank Dashboard
Under Create a Blank Dashboard, click Select.
Step 3: Set Permissions and Save
On the New Dashboard modal, leave the dashboard private, or turn that off to access sharing permissions. When you are happy with the settings, click Confirm to create the new dashboard with those permissions.
Set Permissions On An Existing Dashboard
Step 1: Action Manage Permissions
On your existing dashboard, click the 3-dot "action menu", then click Manage Permissions.
Step 2: Set Permissions and Save
Use the Private toggle to switch between private (only yourself) or sharing permissions.
When you are satisfied with your permissions changes, click Save to close the modal and return to the dashboard.

Agency View Of Dashboard Permissions
Agency Admins will always have full access to all dashboards except those marked private by their creator. In the Agency view, there are
three
roles with access settings:
Agency User,
Account Admin, and Account User.
Account View Of Dashboard Permissions
In the Account view there are
two
roles with access settings: Account Admin and Account User.
Roles and Permissions Hierarchy
Dashboard Permissions follow a clear hierarchy to ensure smooth management of access levels:
Agency Admins > Agency Users > Account Admins > Account Users.
Permissions for higher-level roles will override permissions for lower-level roles. Lower-level roles cannot posess higher permissions than higher-level roles.
For example, if a dashboard is set to Account Admin:Edit and Account User:Edit is changed to Account Admin:View, then Account User will be automatically changed to View as well.
Frequently Asked Questions
Q: What happens if no permissions are set?
By default, dashboards are visible to all users unless restricted.
Q: What does "Only Assigned Data" restrict exactly?
It filters dashboard widgets to only show data related to the user's assigned records (contacts, opportunities, etc.).
Q: How do I remove a user or role from a dashboard?
Re-open the permissions modal for the dashboard and uncheck the user or role.
