How to Submit a New API-Related Idea to HighLevel
Our API Docs list all available endpoints that are publicly available. If you don’t see an endpoint on either of the API developer sites listed below, we recommend visiting our
GitHub Issues page
to submit your request.
Differences Between API Access Across Plan Levels
Basic API access is included with our Starter and Unlimited plans, while Advanced API access is available on our Agency Pro plan.
In addition to the future endpoints that will be released in our OAuth 2.0 API (which is only available in our Advanced API access), this tier unlocks the use of Agency API Keys where lower plan levels only access Location API Keys.
What are the Rate Limits for API 1.0 & API 2.0?
GHL has implemented rate limits on our public V2 APIs using OAuth to ensure optimal performance and stability. These limits have been adjusted to:
Burst limit: A maximum of 100 API requests per 10 seconds for each Marketplace app (i.e., client) per resource (i.e., Location or Company).
Daily limit: 200,000 API requests per day for each Marketplace app (i.e., client) per resource (i.e., Location or Company).
These new limits contribute to better overall performance and stability of our system.
To monitor your limited usage, refer to the following API response headers:
'X-RateLimit-Limit-Daily': Your daily limit
'X-RateLimit-Daily-Remaining': The remaining number of requests for the day
'X-RateLimit-Interval-Milliseconds': The time interval for burst requests
'X-RateLimit-Max': The maximum request limit in the specified time interval
'X-RateLimit-Remaining': The remaining number of requests in the current time interval
