Frequently Asked Questions
What is Move Numbers?
Move Numbers is an in‑app workflow in Settings → Phone Integration that reassigns existing phone numbers from a
source
sub‑account to a
destination
sub‑account
within the same Agency
. Eligibility at a glance:
LC Phone ↔ LC Phone (same Agency):
Supported in-app.
Twilio ↔ Twilio (same Master Twilio account):
Supported in-app.
Different Master Twilio accounts:
Not supported in-app—contact
Twilio Support
.
Geography:
The in-app tool currently supports
US & Canada
numbers. For other countries, please open a
HighLevel Support
ticket.
A2P:
A2P status is at the sub‑account level and
does not move
with the phone number; reattach the correct brand/campaign after moving.
Before You Begin
Make sure you have admin access to the
source
and
destination
sub‑accounts.
Identify the
destination Location ID
(a.k.a. Sub‑account ID):
Settings → Business Profile
.
Confirm which phone system the number uses today:
LC Phone
(LeadConnector)
Twilio
connected at the Agency level
Move Numbers Between Sub‑Accounts
Step 1:
Move Numbers
Navigate to the
Agency Settings → Phone Integration.
Under Sub-account Settings
,
click on
Move Numbers
.
Step 2:
Select Source and Destination Sub-account and Phone Numbers to Move
Choose the destination sub‑account (search by name or paste the Location ID).  Select the phone number(s) you want to move.
Please Note:
Review the summary and click Move Numbers to start the transfer. Numbers will appear in the destination sub‑account once complete. After the move, re‑check number‑level settings (forwarding, recordings, whispers, etc.). Verify call/SMS flows, automations, and user assignments as needed.
Troubleshooting & Known Limitations
If the
Move Numbers
action is unavailable or fails, common causes include:
Different Twilio master accounts:
Numbers under a different Twilio master can’t be moved in‑app. Contact Twilio Support in this case.
Missing regulatory configuration (international):
Some countries (e.g., AU +61) require approved
Regulatory Bundles
and an
Address SID
in the
destination
. Configure those first, then follow the relevant migration guide.
Provider mismatch:
If you’re converting
Twilio ↔ LC Phone
, follow the dedicated
conversion articles
rather than the in‑app move.
Country support (US & Canada in-app):
The in-app tool currently moves
US & Canada
numbers. For other countries, please create a
HighLevel Support
ticket.
Frequently Asked Questions
Q. Can I move multiple numbers at once?
Yes—select multiple numbers in
Move Numbers
.
Q. Do I need to contact Twilio?
Not for in‑app sub‑account moves. For inter‑Agency moves or provider conversions, follow the linked guides and contact HighLevel Support.
Q. Do A2P/Toll‑Free approvals transfer automatically?
After the move, verify the number is attached to the correct brand/campaign or Toll‑Free verification in the destination.
