How to Upload Subtitles in HighLevel
Upload subtitles to your video lessons using standard .srt files to quickly enable captions across different languages.
To upload subtitles to your course videos:
Navigate to
Sites > Courses
and open the course you want to edit.
Click on a
Lesson
that contains a video.
Locate the
Upload Subtitles
option next to the video player.
Click
Upload Subtitle
and choose a
.srt
file from your device.
Select the appropriate
language
from the dropdown list.
Click
Save
to attach the subtitle file to the video.
Using the Advanced Subtitle Editor
Edit and improve your subtitles with HighLevel’s advanced editor, featuring real-time error detection and visual timestamp navigation.
After uploading a subtitle file, you can use the built-in editor to refine it:
Click on the
Edit Subtitles
button next to the uploaded file.
View subtitles in a structured list with timestamps and text content.
Navigate easily by clicking timestamps to jump to specific video moments.
If there are issues (e.g., overlapping lines or gaps), warning icons will appear.
Hover over the warning icon to view the issue description.
Click directly into the text to make corrections, then select
Save Changes
.
Raw Mode Editing
Raw Mode lets you manually adjust subtitles for full control over text and timing when precision is essential.
Raw Mode is useful when you want direct access to the subtitle file’s structure:
In the Subtitle Editor, click the
Switch to Raw Mode
button.
Edit the file using standard
.srt
formatting (e.g., timestamps followed by subtitle text).
Carefully review the syntax to avoid formatting errors.
Once complete, click
Save
to update the video with your changes.
