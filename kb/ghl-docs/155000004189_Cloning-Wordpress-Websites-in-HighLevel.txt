Frequently Asked Questions
What is WordPress Site Cloning?
WordPress site cloning is the process of duplicating an existing site to create a new, fully independent copy. This functionality preserves the source site's configurations, themes, plugins, and content. Cloning is especially useful for creating multiple sites with similar layouts, designs, or settings.
Why Clone a WordPress Site?
Efficiency
: Save time by reusing an existing site's setup instead of building from scratch.
Consistency
: Ensure uniformity in themes, plugins, and settings across multiple sites.
Flexibility
: Create independent sites where changes to one do not affect others.
Ease of Use
: Simplifies complex workflows, such as testing updates or creating development environments.
Role-Based Access for Cloning
Access to the cloning feature is governed by user roles to ensure security. Only users with the following roles can clone WordPress sites:
Agency Owners
Agency Users
Account Users
(within the same sub-account)
If a user lacks the necessary permissions, they will only be able to create a new site from scratch. This ensures that only authorized individuals can duplicate sites.
