Authorization
Authorization is the process of granting or denying access to resources based on a user's verified identity and permissions. It determines what a user can do within a system after they have been authenticated (proven their identity). Essentially, it's about verifying that a user has the right to access specific resources or perform certain actions.
HighLevel currently supports two types of authorization:
​
Private Integration Token
OAuth 2.0 Flow
When should I use a Private Integration Token?
​
You should use a Private Integration Token if:
Your use case involves accessing our API endpoints for internal purposes.
If you don't need webhooks or custom design or pages.
If you need to access only 1 sub-account at a time.
Example use cases:
​
Internal data synchronization
Custom reporting dashboards
Automated tasks within your own system
When should I use OAuth 2.0 Flow?
​
You should use OAuth 2.0 Flow if:
You're developing a full-scale integration intended for public use.
Your integration requires features like webhooks and custom modules.
You need advanced security features and standardized authorization management.
Example use cases:
​
Third-party applications
Creating custom conversation providers/custom workflow actions and triggers, etc.
