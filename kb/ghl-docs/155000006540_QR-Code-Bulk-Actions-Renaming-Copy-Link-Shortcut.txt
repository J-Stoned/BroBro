Overview of QR Codes Bulk Actions, Renaming & Copy Link Shortcut
HighLevel’s QR Code Bulk Actions & Quick Management features adds multi-select workflows (move, delete, download), inline editing, and instant link sharing to the QR Codes List Page. By surfacing core tasks in one toolbar, teams can maintain huge code libraries without opening each QR code individually.
Key Benefits of QR Code Bulk Actions
Time Savings:
Select many items and complete common tasks (move, download, delete) in one go.
Fewer Clicks:
Rename QR Codes and folders directly from the list view, no page changes required.
Faster Sharing:
Copy Link from any QR Code page without clicking into the specific QR Code.
Smarter Exports:
Download as
PNG, SVG, or PDF
; large batches are zipped asynchronously for reliable delivery.
