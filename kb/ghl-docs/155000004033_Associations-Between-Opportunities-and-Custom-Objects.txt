of every Opportunity and its related data.
Mirror
real business relationships
—such as linking customers, properties, or events to deals.
Reduce time spent navigating across records by managing related information from one screen.
Use
association data
in workflows, reports, and exports to personalize automation and improve tracking.

View associated records across
Opportunity Details

List Views
.
Add association fields to layouts via
Manage Fields → Association Label (Object Type)
for better visibility and reporting.
How to Create an Association
Step 1:
Open the Associations Tab
Go to
Settings → Custom Objects → [Your Object]
.
Click on the
Associations
tab at the top of the screen.
Click
Create Association
to start configuring a new link between your Custom Object and Opportunities.
Step 2:
Configure the Association
When the
Create Association
panel opens:
Select the object
to associate with (for example,
Opportunities
).
Name your association
:
Use a
Single Label
(e.g., “Deal”) if both objects share the same reference.
Use a
Pair of Labels
(e.g., “Buyer ↔ Seller”) if each side should show a unique name.
Configure the relationship type
:
One-to-One:
Each record can connect to only one record on the other side.
One-to-Many / Many-to-One:
One record connects to multiple others.
Many-to-Many:
Unlimited connections both ways.
(Optional) Set
record limits
to restrict the number of connections per record (up to 1,000).
Review the
Preview
panel to confirm your setup, then click
Save
.
Managing Associations from Opportunities
Once your association is created, you can link records directly from the Opportunity.
Open any
Opportunity record
.
Navigate to the
Associated Objects
tab in the left-hand panel.
Click
+ Associate new [Object]
.
Search and select the Custom Object you want to link.
Choose the relevant
label
(such as “Deal” or “Property”), then click
Save
.
Your association will appear immediately under its corresponding category (e.g., Contacts, Events, Properties).
You can click any associated record to open it in a side panel for quick edits or to view additional details without leaving the Opportunity screen.
Viewing Associations in the CRM
After setting up associations, they appear throughout your CRM to improve visibility and workflow efficiency.
Opportunity Details
All linked Custom Objects are displayed in the
Associated Objects
panel of an Opportunity. This gives users direct access to related data (such as linked Events or Contacts) in one view.
Kanban View
In the
Kanban view
, you can display associations directly on Opportunity cards.
To do this:
Go to
Opportunities → Manage Fields
.
Add the field
Association Label (Object Type)
to your card layout.
This helps sales teams quickly identify which Events, Properties, or Objects are tied to each Opportunity.
List View
In the
List view
, you can add the same association field as a column to display all linked records in a single glance.
This is especially useful for bulk reviews, filtering, and CSV exports.
Tips
You can create up to
10 unique labels
between each pair of objects.
Each label supports
up to 1,000 linked records
per side.
Deleting
an Opportunity or Custom Object will automatically remove its associations.
API support
for associations will be added in future updates.
To include association data in
exports or reports
, add the association field through
Manage Fields
.
Example Use Cases
Real Estate
Link multiple “Property” Custom Objects to a single “Opportunity (Buyer)” to see all properties a client is interested in. This gives agents quick visibility into each buyer’s options.
Events
Connect “Event” Custom Objects with their related “Sponsorship Deal” Opportunities. This setup helps event managers understand which deals are tied to each event.
Insurance
Associate “Policy” or “Quote” Custom Objects to the corresponding Opportunities. Agents can easily track the policy, quote, and opportunity all from a single view.
Frequently Asked Questions
Q: Can I limit an Opportunity to only one Custom Object?
Yes. When configuring your relationship, choose
One-to-One
or set
One-to-N
with N = 1.
Q: Will renaming a label break existing associations?
No. Renaming only changes the display label; the internal link remains intact.
Q: Can I bulk import associations?
Not yet. Associations must currently be created manually or via workflows.
Q: Can I include associations in reports and exports?
Yes. Once the field is added in
Manage Fields
, it will appear in exports and reporting data.
Q: What happens if I delete a record?
When an Opportunity or Custom Object is deleted, all of its associated links are automatically removed to maintain data integrity.
