What is Audit Logs?
Audit Logs are the source of truth for who did what and when across your HighLevel account. They provide time-stamped entries (with user, module, and action context) to help admins troubleshoot changes, maintain accountability, and meet compliance needs. The New Design System UI modernizes the experience so you can review details without leaving the main table.
Audit Logs provide a time-stamped record of key actions taken in your HighLevel account, enabling transparency and traceability for admins and power users. The updated interface delivers the same insights in a cleaner, faster workflow consistent with other New Design System screens.
Key Benefits of the New Audit Logs UI
Understanding the value of the redesign helps your team adopt it quickly and apply Audit Logs confidently during investigations.
Drawer view:
Details open in a right-side panel so you never lose your table position.
Keyboard navigation:
Use
←/→
to move through entries quickly while keeping the drawer open.
Consistent components:
New Design System spacing and typography improve readability and reduce scanning fatigue.
Faster triage:
Stay in context to confirm changes, capture evidence, and move on without extra page loads.
Enhanced Visibility & Accountability:
Track all changes made to users, accounts, and settings to maintain a clear record of modifications.
Faster Issue Resolution:
Quickly identify and troubleshoot unexpected changes, saving time and effort.
Improved Security & Compliance:
Monitor user actions to prevent unauthorized modifications and ensure adherence to policies.
Efficient User Management:
Keep track of user activity, including account creations, edits, and deletions, for better team oversight.
Drawer & Keyboard Navigation
The redesigned, right-side drawer keeps you in context while you investigate changes. Once the drawer is open, you can use the keyboard to move through records without closing the panel—perfect for scanning long audit trails quickly and accurately.
Open details in place:
Click any row to open the sleek right-side drawer with field-level before/after values, user, and timestamp—no page reloads and no lost scroll position.
Navigate with arrow keys:
With the drawer open, press
left and right arrow keys
to jump to the previous or next audit record; the drawer updates in place so you maintain focus.
Work faster, click less:
Keep hands on the keyboard to minimize misclicks and speed up reviews during long investigation sessions.
Stay in control:
Close the drawer with the
X
icon or
Esc
; you’ll return to the exact spot in the table.
Refreshed Layout
Visual consistency improves scanning and reduces errors, especially when you’re reviewing dozens of entries.
Updated spacing, table density, and text hierarchy improve legibility.
Components are standardized with other New Design System areas for a shorter learning curve.
Contrast and focus states are enhanced for clarity without visual noise.
Understanding Audit Log Filters
Each filter focuses the results so you can quickly isolate the most relevant events. Understanding what each option does helps you audit faster with fewer clicks.
User:
Select a specific team member to view only the actions they performed. Ideal for monitoring individual contributions and investigating suspected edits.
Module:
Choose the affected area of the platform (e.g.,
Users, Accounts, Contacts, Opportunities, Websites/Funnels/Stores, Custom Objects, Listings
) to focus on events from that system.
Action Type:
Limit results to a type of change such as
Create, Update, or Delete
. Useful for spotting critical changes quickly.
Time Range:
Constrain results to a defined window (e.g., today, last 7 days, or upto 60 days) to match when the change occurred.
How To Access the New Audit Logs UI
The redesign is live across both
Agency
and
Sub-Account (Location)
contexts. Open Audit Logs in the context you need to review—each view shows only its own scope (agency-wide vs. location-specific).
Choose your context:
Agency-wide activity:
Go to
Agency → Settings → Audit Logs
Sub-Account activity:
Go to
Sub-Account → Settings → Audit Logs
From the Audit logs list, click the Preview (Eye) button or anywhere in the row to
open
the details
drawer
of that log
Use
←/→
on your keyboard
to cycle through entries while keeping the drawer open.
Apply filters
to narrow results. The
User
filter is available in
both Agency and Sub-Account
Audit Logs. (Other filter options such as
Module
and
Action
can vary by module.)
For module-specific reviews (e.g.,
Funnels/Websites/Webinars/Stores
), open
Settings → Audit Logs
inside the relevant Sub-Account
to see those entries.
Frequently Asked Questions

Agency Admins
at
Agency → Settings → Audit Logs

Account Admins
at

Q: How long do the Logs retain for?
Audit Log entries are retained for
60 days
and then purged. Plan to capture needed evidence within that window.
