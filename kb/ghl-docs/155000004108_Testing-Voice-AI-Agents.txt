Before deploying your agent, it’s important to test its functionality. You can learn more about how your AI Agent handles specific inquiries that may arise from a conversation with a prospect or customer, and you can use that information to fine-tune your Voice AI Agent so you ultimately get a higher conversion rate!
Validate your HighLevel Voice AI agents quickly with
Two Testing methods
—
Phone Call
or
Web Call
—so you can iterate on prompts, flows, and settings with confidence. Use the phone option when you want a real telephony path, or launch a browser‑based Web Call to skip number provisioning and test instantly.

What are Test Calls for Voice AI Agents?
Test Calls let you simulate real conversations with a Voice AI agent before going live. You can either receive a
Phone Call
from the agent to your phone number or start a
Web Call
directly in your browser.
Both
methods help you verify behavior, tune prompts, and confirm actions. During
Web Call
trials,
call transfer is not supported
; the session uses your
logged‑in contact
as the caller identity.
Key Benefits of Test Calls
Use these advantages to speed up setup, reduce friction, and improve quality before launch.
Faster testing:
Start a
Web Call
instantly—no phone number purchase or dialing required.
Realistic validation:
Use the
Phone Call
method to test end‑to‑end telephony behavior.
Rapid feedback loops:
Hear responses immediately, then refine prompts, knowledge, and settings.
High feature parity:
Exercise nearly all agent actions during trials (
Web Call excludes call transfer
).
Clear caller identity:
Web Call maps the session to the
logged‑in user’s contact
for consistent context.
Test data hygiene:
Keep trial activity out of analytics dashboards and focus on production insights.
