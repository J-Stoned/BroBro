Overview
To help users navigate faster and stay connected to their most important groups, GoKollab now allows you to
pin your favorite groups
for quick access. Pinned groups are displayed at the top of the dedicated group sidebar, making it easier to jump into the spaces you use most.
Whether you're in
GoKollab
or within your
Communities
, this feature ensures your top groups are just a click away.
Key Benefits

Keep key groups visible at all times
Simplifies navigation within both GoKollab and Communities
How Group Pinning Works?
Users can pin up to
4 groups
in both
GoKollab
and
Communities
.
In
GoKollab
,
only pinned groups
are shown in the group sidebar.
In
Communities
,
pinned groups appear first
, followed by the remaining groups under the sub-account.
How to Pin a Group?
Open the
Group Switcher
(located in the top navigation bar).
Scroll to find the group you want to pin.
Hover over the group card to reveal a
pin icon
on the right.
Click the pin icon to pin the group.
The group will now appear at the
top of the sidebar
and in the
Group Switcher
.
How to Unpin a Group?
Open the
Group Switcher
.
Locate the pinned group at the top.
Click the
unpin icon
on the right of the pinned group card.
The group will return to its default position in the list.
Notes:
You can pin a maximum of
4 groups
per view (GoKollab and Communities).
This feature is purely for ease of navigation—it doesn’t affect group visibility for other members.
