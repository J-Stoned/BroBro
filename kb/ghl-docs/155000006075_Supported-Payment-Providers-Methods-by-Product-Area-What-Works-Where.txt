Frequently Asked Questions
Q: Why does the wallet button (e.g., Apple Pay/Google Pay) not appear even though the table shows “Y”?
Wallet buttons only appear in supported environments:
Apple Pay on Apple devices
(iPhone/iPad/Mac) and
Google Pay on Android
. Make sure the method is enabled with your provider and the wallet is set up on the device.
Q: The table shows “Y” for a provider—does that guarantee subscriptions will work?
Not necessarily. Some methods support only one-time payments. Check the
Note
above and test your recurring use case before launch.
Q: Can I show Stripe and PayPal together on the same checkout?
In many product areas you can offer more than one option if both are connected and enabled. The checkout will show the available buttons/options automatically.
Q: Do card readers work on Order Forms or Invoices?
No. Card readers are only marked
Y
for
POS
. Use POS for in‑person payments.
