What is Reselling Paywall Payment Error Handling?
Reselling Paywall error handling is the behind-the-scenes logic that validates customer information, talks to Stripe, and decides what a location or agency user should see whenever something goes wrong at checkout. By refining this logic, HighLevel now catches more edge-cases—like missing addresses, disabled offerings, or network hiccups—before they frustrate you or your clients.
Key Benefits of the New Error Handling
Real-time, human-readable error messages appear directly on the Paywall screen, so users know exactly why a payment failed.
Additional Stripe safeguards prevent duplicate subscriptions if customers open several tabs.
Validation checks for customer address, default payment method, and payment source reduce “unknown error” messages.
Resilience to network interruptions and Stripe timeouts curtails abandoned carts.
Uniform logic across WhatsApp, WordPress, Yext, Ads, and future Marketplace apps means less confusion.
Stripe Error Messaging
Smarter Stripe responses convert cryptic API codes into plain-English guidance (e.g., “Card declined—add a new card to continue”). The system now also surfaces Stripe’s “no default payment method” and “missing payment source” errors, prompting users to update their billing details instead of retrying blindly.
Customer Address Validation
Every Paywall flow now verifies that the customer’s billing address is present and correctly formatted before Stripe creates the subscription. If the address is missing or invalid, the Paywall blocks the transaction and instructs the user to complete their profile. This pre-flight check eliminates one of the most common Stripe failure reasons.
Offering Disabled During Checkout
If an agency disables (or deletes) an offering while a customer is mid-purchase, the Paywall now cancels the transaction gracefully and displays a descriptive notice. This avoids orphaned subscriptions and charge disputes.
Network Interruption Handling
Transient network drops no longer leave customers staring at a spinner. The Paywall automatically retries safe operations and shows a “Connection lost—please retry” banner if a retry still fails, preventing duplicate payments.
Duplicate Subscription Safeguard
Opening multiple tabs or double-clicking the Pay & Subscribe button previously risked creating two active Stripe subscriptions. The Paywall now locks the customer record during checkout, ensuring that only one subscription is ever created.
How To Set Up Reliable Paywall Checkouts
A clean Stripe connection and accurate customer profiles are the fastest path to error-free payments.
Connect Stripe (Settings ➜ Integrations ➜ Stripe) and verify that the account is in Live mode with at least one active payment method.
Configure allowed payment methods per sub-account under Payments ➜ Integrations ➜ Manage Payment Methods, enabling cards, ACH, wallets, or Klarna as needed.
Confirm a billing address for every location (Payments ➜ Customers ➜ Edit Customer).
If you sell subscriptions outside Paywall, enable payment-retry rules (Payments ➜ Settings ➜ Subscription) to auto-retry up to three times.
Advise clients to complete payment from a single browser tab to benefit from the duplicate-subscription lock.
(Optional) Embed FAQs or support links near your Paywall so users can instantly resolve declined-card issues.
Frequently Asked Questions
Q: A customer sees “No default payment method found.” What should they do?
A: Ask the customer to click “Add Payment Method” on the Paywall and enter a valid card; Stripe cannot create a subscription without one.
Q: Why did a subscription move to “Unpaid” after several retries?
A: After the configured retry attempts fail, HighLevel flags the subscription as Unpaid (or cancels it, if you enabled auto-cancel). The customer can still pay the generated invoice to reactivate the subscription.
Q: Can I customize the new error messages?
A: The wording follows Stripe’s recommended phrasing for compliance, so it is not currently editable.
Q: What happens if the agency disables an offering I already purchased?
A: Future rebills stop automatically, and the customer receives a notice. Existing services may continue until the end of the current billing period, depending on the offering’s terms.
Q: Will these improvements affect one-time charges or only subscriptions?
A: Most changes target subscription flows, but clearer Stripe error messages also apply to one-time Paywall purchases.
Q: How can I test these scenarios in Sandbox?
A: Use Stripe test cards (e.g., 4000 0000 0000 0002 for a declined payment) and unplug your internet briefly to test network-interruption handling.
