Please make sure that you are not using the test workflow button when testing the Facebook Conversion API in Workflow.
Always save and publish and use one of these triggers to test your conversion..
Trigger should be a input trigger like
Form Submission
Survey submission
Appointment Submission (from booking widget)
2 step order form
For appointment it will only work with
“Customer Booked appointment” not with “appointment” as appointments is general trigger and “Customer Booked appointment” is the trigger for widget
Lead value is required if you will use Purchase event of else you can keep it blank.
