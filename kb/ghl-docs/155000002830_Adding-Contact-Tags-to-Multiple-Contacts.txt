Yes, you can select and apply multiple tags simultaneously in a single bulk action. Simply add all desired tags in the Tags field before submitting the action.

To remove tags from contacts, use the “Remove Tag” bulk action. You can either remove specific tags or clear all tags from selected contacts. This will be covered in a separate article.
