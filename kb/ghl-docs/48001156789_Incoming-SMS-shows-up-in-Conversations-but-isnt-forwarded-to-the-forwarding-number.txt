Overview
HighLevel’s mobile and web apps are built to receive inbound SMS messages directly within the Conversations tab. However, by configuring a workflow with custom triggers and notifications, you can also forward these incoming messages notifications—though this will result in additional charges.
If you’d like incoming SMS messages to appear in the Conversations tab
and
be automatically forwarded to a designated number as a notification, this guide will walk you through the process. By following the troubleshooting steps provided, you can ensure that every incoming message is successfully redirected to your chosen forwarding number.
