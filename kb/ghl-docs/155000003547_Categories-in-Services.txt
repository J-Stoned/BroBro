What are Categories?
Categories are used to group similar or related services, making it easier for customers to navigate your offerings. Categories appear on your booking page as organized sections, with each service listed under its assigned category.
For example, a spa might have categories like Massage, Hair, Skin, and Salon, with multiple services listed under each.
Key Benefits of Categories
Understanding these benefits keeps your booking page tidy and ensures customers see the right services in the right place.
Organization:
Group services into named sections that appear on the booking page.
Faster Discovery:
Help customers quickly scan to the services they care about.
Direct Sharing:
Use a Category URL (slug) to share a link that shows only that category’s services.
Control Display Order:
Control the order the categories are in on the customer‑facing booking page.
Built‑in Fallback:
A Default Category exists so deleted categories’ services (and unassigned new services) remain bookable.
Default Category
Every account starts with a Default Category, which:
Cannot be deleted (but it can be renamed).
Any new service that isn’t assigned a category will be placed into the Default Category by the system.
If a category is deleted, all its services will be moved into the Default Category to ensure they remain bookable.
This way, every service always belongs to a category, keeping your booking page organized and functional.
Creating a New Category
Set up a category to group related services and generate a shareable link for that category.
Navigate to
Calendar
>
Calendar

+ New Category
.
Enter a Category Name.

button.
If you already have services created, you can assign them to this new category after creation.

Consider renaming the Default Category to something specific for your business.
Share category-specific booking links for promotions or targeted campaigns.
