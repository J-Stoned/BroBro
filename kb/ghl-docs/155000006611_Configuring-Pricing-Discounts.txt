What is Pricing in Rentals?
Pricing in Rentals is dynamic — it adapts based on conditions like date ranges, booking durations, or rental quantity. Each listing or variant has its own price configuration, allowing flexibility for different rental scenarios.
Your pricing setup consists of:
Base Price
— The foundational rate for each listing or variant.
Security Deposit
(optional)
— Refundable or card-on-file charge to cover damages or losses.
Advanced Pricing Rules
— Conditional rules that adjust the price based on time, duration, or demand.
By configuring theses pricing options, you are able to build a pricing structure perfect for your rentals!
Key Benefits of Configuring Pricing for Rentals
Granular Control:
Build precise pricing with layered rules that reflect seasonality and demand.
Consistency:
The same logic applies at checkout and in admin‑created bookings, reducing surprises.
Strategic Incentives &
Duration discounts:
reward longer rentals without manual promo management.
Hour‑of‑Day:
Charge premiums for peak hours.
Deposits:
separate from price, visible on checkout/invoices for easier reconciliation.
How to Configure Pricing
You can configure pricing under the
Inventory &
Pricing
tab when editing a listing.
To get to the
Inventory &
Pricing
tab, follow these steps:
Navigate to
Calendar Settings > Rentals
Click the
Edit (Pencil) icon
next to the listing you would like to edit
Select the
Inventory & Pricing
tab
There are 3 main areas of pricing that can be configured within this tab.
1. Base Price
Defines the default amount charged for the rental period.
Based on the selected
Booking Unit
: Hour, Day, Week, or Month.
Example:
If you charge $50/hour, and the customer books for 4 hours, the total due before adjustments will be $200.
2. Security Deposit (Optional)
The security deposit option is only available if
enabled in Global Settings
.
Click here to learn more about Global Settings.
To enable security deposit from global settings go to
Calendar Settings > Rentals > Global Settings > Payment Settings
then toggle on
Enable Security Deposits.
If the security deposit is set to $0, it is hidden from the booking website and isn't charged.
Note:
The deposit amount does
not
affect the base price; it displays separately on invoices and checkout summaries.
3. Advanced Pricing Rules
Click
Advanced Pricing
to set up rule-based pricing adjustments. You can create multiple pricing conditions such as seasonal surcharges or long-duration discounts.
If
variants are enabled
, pricing is configured separately per variant. Each variant will have its own pricing tab and independent rules.
Advanced Pricing Rule Types
To use advanced pricing rules, first toggle on the pricing you would like to set up.
1. Seasonal Pricing
Seasonal pricing allows you to modify the base rate for specific date ranges—such as holidays, busy seasons, or low-demand periods.
When configuring this rule, you can choose between two modes:
Percentage (+/− %)
– Adjusts the existing base price by a percentage. For example, if your base rate is $100 and you apply a -20% seasonal adjustment, the total becomes $80 for that range.
Flat
– Replaces the base price entirely for the specified date range. This means the entered flat rate becomes the new price,
not
an incremental change. For example, if the base rate is $100 and you set a flat rate of $150, the system will charge $150 per unit—not $250.
Use flat rate when you want to completely override the base pricing for a season (e.g., fixed holiday pricing) and percentage when you want relative adjustments that build on your existing rate. To add an additional date range, click
+ Add Date Range
.
2. Day of Week Pricing
Adjust pricing based on the day of the week.
Useful for rentals with higher demand on weekends.
Each day can have a unique percentage adjustment.
Use a minus (-) sign for discounts and just a number for rate increases.
Example:
Saturday +10%, Sunday -15%.
3. Hour of Day Pricing
Modify prices based on the time of day.
Enables surge pricing for peak hours.
Example:
6 PM–10 PM → +20% for evening demand.
Important:
Hour-of-day pricing applies
only
when your listing’s
Booking Unit
is set to
Hourly
. For Day, Week, or Month units, this rule is ignored.
4. Duration Discounts
Duration discounts reward customers for booking longer rental periods. These discounts are entered as
positive values
, but their effect is to
reduce
the final price.
Define thresholds (for example: 3 days, 7 days, 30 days).
Each threshold represents a
tier
—once the booking duration meets or exceeds that value, the corresponding discount applies.
Discounts can be set as
Flat ($)
or
Percentage (%)
reductions.
Tiering logic:
The
highest tier reached
determines the discount. If you set a 3-day discount of 5% and no higher tiers, any booking lasting
3 days or more (4, 5, 7, etc.)
will also receive that same 5% discount.
Example:
10% off for 7+ day rentals and 20% off for 30+ day rentals. A 14-day booking gets 10% off, while a 40-day booking gets 20% off.
Note:
Duration discounts apply
after
all other time-based rules (like Seasonal or Day-of-Week pricing) have been calculated.
5. Quantity Discounts
Quantity discounts reduce the per-unit cost when customers rent multiple units of the same listing. These are entered as
positive values
, but their effect is to
lower
the overall price.
Define quantity thresholds (for example: 3 units, 5 units, 10 units).
Each threshold acts as a
tier
. Once that quantity is met or exceeded, the corresponding discount applies to
all booked units
.
If you define only one tier (e.g., 5% off for 5+ units), that discount will apply for any booking of 5 or more units.
Example:
5% off for 5+ units, 10% off for 10+ units. A 7-unit booking receives 5% off, while a 12-unit booking receives 10% off.
Important:
Quantity Discounts are only available when the
inventory
is enabled for the listing.
Quantity discounts follow the same
tier carry-forward logic
as duration discounts and are also applied
after
time-based pricing rules to ensure consistency.
Stacking Order (Rule Application Priority)
Pricing rules are evaluated in the following sequence:
Base Price → Seasonal → Day of Week → Hour of Day → Duration Discount → Quantity Discount.
Order
Rule Type
Applies When
Notes
1
Base Price
Always
Fundamental rate for the listing.
2
Seasonal Pricing
If current date is within a defined range.
Overrides base price temporarily.
3
Day of Week Pricing
If booking overlaps a configured day.
Adjusts the running total after seasonal.
4
Hour of Day Pricing
Only if booking unit = Hourly.
Applies additional fine-grained adjustments.
5
Duration Discounts
If total duration meets/exceeds threshold.
Reduces total price after time-based adjustments.
6
Quantity Discounts
If multiple units booked.
Reduces per-unit rate at checkout.
For non-hourly listings
, Hour-of-Day pricing isn't applicable.
Additional Pricing Nuances
Pricing in Rentals follows consistent rules across
all booking sources
— whether a booking is made by a customer on the
Booking Website
or created internally through the
in-app flow
. The same logic applies everywhere to ensure predictable billing for every duration, time frame, or adjustment.
How Pricing Rules Apply
When determining which pricing adjustments (like
Seasonal
,
Day of Week
, or
Hour of Day
) apply, the system checks the
start time
of each billed unit — such as an hour, day, week, or month — and applies the relevant rule for that entire unit.
This means Rentals does not split pricing mid-way through overlapping time windows. Instead, once a rule applies at the start of a billed block, it stays in effect for that full block.
Example:
Day of Week Pricing
Let’s say your listing charges
per day
and has a +10% rule for
Tuesdays
.
A booking starts at
11:30 PM on Tuesday
and ends at
11:30 PM on Thursday
.
Since the booking
starts on Tuesday
, the system applies the Tuesday uplift for the
entire first day
.
The
base rate
will apply from the next billing day onward i.e
for
Wednesday
.
This helps ensure each billed unit (in this case, one day) is priced consistently instead of being divided into partial-day charges.
How Time-Based Billing Works for Daily, Weekly, and Monthly Units
When a listing’s
pricing unit
is set to
per day, week, or month
, Rentals uses precise time-based calculation instead of simple date differences. This means that the system measures exact time elapsed — not just the number of calendar days.
Example:
Time-Based Pricing
If a daily rental starts on
October 18th at 2:00 PM
and ends on
October 19th at 2:05 PM
, the system charges for
two full days
, because it exceeds a 24-hour period.
Similarly, for weekly and monthly bookings, any minute beyond the defined length (7 days for a week, 30 days for a month) begins a new billing cycle.
This approach applies to all bookings, whether created on the Booking Website or inside the app. Each rental is measured from the exact start date and time to ensure accurate, fair billing.
Calculation Examples
Example 1 — Daily Listing with Seasonal and Duration Rules
Base Price:
$100/day
Seasonal Pricing:
+20% (June 1–Aug 31)
Duration Discount:
10% off for 6 days
Booking:
7 days in July
Calculation:
Base: $100 × 7 days = $700
Seasonal +20% → $700 × 1.2 = $840
Duration Discount 10% → $840 × 0.9 =
$756 total
Example 2 — Hourly Listing with Time-Based Adjustments
Base Price:
$25/hour
Day of Week:
+10% on Saturday
Hour of Day:
+15% between 6 PM–9 PM
Booking:
3-hour rental on Saturday (6–9 PM)
Calculation:
Base: $25 × 3 hours = $75
Day Adjustment +10% → $75 × 1.10 = $82.50
Hour Adjustment +15% → $82.50 × 1.15 =
$94.88 total
Example 3 — Equipment Rental with Quantity Discount
Base Price:
$50/day
Quantity Discount:
5% off for 5 units
Booking:
5 units for 1 day
Calculation:
Base: $50 × 5 units = $250
Quantity Discount 5% → $250 × 0.95 =
$237.50 total
