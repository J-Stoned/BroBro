What are Listings and Categories?
Listings represent the individual rental items you offer—such as properties, vehicles, rooms, or equipment. Each listing contains its own images, description, pricing, inventory (optional), and status. Listings form the foundation of your Rentals setup.
Categories are used to group similar listings and simplify organization for both internal users and customers.
E
xamples:
A property manager might use categories like Beach Houses, Urban Lofts, Mountain Cabins.
An equipment rental company might use Cameras or Lighting Gear as categories to organize listings for specific equipment.
Key Benefits of Listings and Categories
Organization:
Categories make it easier to navigate and manage large rental inventories.
Control of Public Layout:
Reordering categories changes grouping and order on the booking page without touching any settings.
Easy S
haring:
Share links for a listing or category direct customers to exactly what they need, speeding up decisions and reducing support questions.
Customization:
Set up configuration details for pricing, booking settings, and calendar sync.
