How To Use Bulk Actions in Opportunities Cards View
Get started with bulk actions using this simple process:
Access the Opportunities Tab
To begin using bulk actions, navigate to the
Opportunities
tab from the left-hand menu. This opens the card view where all opportunity stages and entries across your pipeline are displayed.
Select a Pipeline
Use the dropdown menu at the top to select the pipeline you want to manage. This filters the Opportunities view to show only entries from the selected pipeline, making bulk updates more focused and efficient.
Choose Your View Mode
Use the toggle icon at the top-right to switch between
Cards view
and
List view
, both of which support bulk actions.
Cards view
is helpful when you want to visually scan and select opportunities by their pipeline stage before applying bulk changes.
List view
is ideal for working with large volumes of data, as it allows quick scrolling, column sorting, and mass selection for bulk edits.
Choose the view based on whether you’re prioritizing visual pipeline context or high-volume record management.
Select  Multiple Opportunities
In order to select opportunities, just hover over to them and click the checkbox that appear at the top right corner of the respective opportunity.
Edit Opportunity Cards
After selecting multiple opportunities in either
Cards
or
List
view, an
Edit
button will appear at the top of the screen. Clicking this allows you to apply changes to all selected records in one go.
Choose a Field to Edit
After clicking
Edit
, use the Bulk Edit panel to select a field you want to update across multiple opportunities. Fields like status, value, pipeline, and owner are commonly used for reassignments, cleanup, or campaign-based updates. In the next part, we will explain some of the fields like Assign owner.
Assign a New Owner
Select the
Owner
field to reassign opportunities to a different team member. This is especially useful when redistributing leads during team shifts, vacations, or coverage gaps.
Change Pipeline and Stage
Use the
Pipeline
and
Stage
fields to relocate multiple opportunities across workflows. This is helpful when leads need to be regrouped under a new sales process or post-campaign phase.
Update Opportunity Status
Select
Status
to mark selected opportunities as Open, Won, Lost, or Abandoned. This streamlines updates after call reviews, outreach sequences, or campaign follow-ups.
Use “Select All” for Bulk Updates
When working with large volumes, you can click
Select all [number]
to include every opportunity visible in the current pipeline. This saves time when applying the same change across an entire group of records.
