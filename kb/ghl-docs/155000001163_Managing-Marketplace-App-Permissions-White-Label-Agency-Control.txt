This article offers step-by-step instructions for white label agencies on how to manage the visibility and installation of marketplace apps for their sub-accounts. This feature allows agencies to have granular control over which apps are available to their sub-account customers.

Bulk Approve/Disapprove Marketplace Apps:
Locating the App Permissions Management:
Click on 'App Marketplace' on the left menu.
Note: If 'App marketplace' is not visible on your agency account, you can enable it from the labs.
Click on 'Manage App Permissions' located on the right top corner.
Here, you will find apps that have a distribution type of either 'Sub-Account' or 'Agency & Subaccount'.
Approving Apps:
By Default:
All apps that are in public and live status are approved for your sub-accounts.
This default setting also applies to new apps that pass our review process and are made public.
To Approve Disapproved Apps:
Under 'App state', select 'Disapproved apps'.
For bulk action, choose the apps you wish to approve and click the 'approve' button on the right top corner.
Confirm your decision by clicking 'Approve' in the modal window.
Once approved, the apps become visible to sub-account users under their App Marketplace. These users can then view and install them.
For Individual Apps:
Navigate to the app details page by clicking on the specific app.
Click 'approve' on the right top corner.
Confirm the action by selecting 'Approve' in the modal.
Disapproving Apps:
Under 'App state', select 'Approved apps'.
For bulk action, choose the apps you wish to disapprove and click the 'disapprove' button on the right top corner.
Confirm your decision by typing 'CONFIRM' in the action box and then click on 'disapprove'.
Effects of Disapproving:
The disapproved apps will no longer be visible or installable at the sub-account level.
If these apps were previously installed, they will be uninstalled from all associated sub-accounts. This includes any supplementary features, such as custom conversation providers, workflow actions, triggers, and more.
Disapproved apps can be approved again in the future. However, they won't be automatically reinstalled in sub-accounts where they were previously installed. They need to be manually installed again.
Bulk Approve/Disapprove Marketplace Apps:
Disabling this Option:
Click the settings icon on the top right corner.
Deselect the option 'allow sub-accounts to view and install apps built by 3rd party developers'.
Click 'Save'.
Effects of Disabling:
Sub-accounts can no longer view or install any marketplace apps. They'll only see an 'App marketplace' option in their left menu, prompting them to contact the agency admin for access.
All apps will change to a disapproved status.
Previously installed apps in sub-accounts will be uninstalled.
Re-enabling this Option:
Navigate to 'App Marketplace' from the left menu. (Enable from labs if not visible).
Click 'Manage App Permissions' on the top right.
Click the settings icon on the top right.
Select the box 'allow sub-accounts to view and install apps built by 3rd party developers'.
Click 'Save'.
Effects of Re-enabling:
All new public apps will automatically be approved for your sub-accounts.
All previously approved apps will become visible and installable at the sub-account level.
Disapproved apps will remain in their disapproved status until manually approved.
