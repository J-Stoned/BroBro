Action-Level Notes (Formerly Known as Comments)
Overview
Action Notes allow users to attach notes to individual actions within a workflow, offering more detailed commentary on specific steps. This is useful when there’s a need to explain the purpose or special conditions of an action, ensuring everyone on the team understands the intent behind it.
Who Can Add Notes
:
Every user has the capability to add action "Action Notes".
How to use
:
When hovering over any action in a workflow, users will see a
notes icon
in the top-right corner of the action. Clicking it allows them to add action-specific notes.
Visibility
:
Once a note is added to an action, the notes icon remains permanently visible, signaling that additional context or instructions are associated with that action.
History Tracking
:
Each note keeps a
history of additions
, allowing teams to track discussions, updates, and feedback specific to that action.
Centralized Notes View
:
All action-level notes can also be viewed and searched within the main
Notes
section. This creates a central location for tracking all notes associated with a workflow, making it easy to review and manage them.
Sticky Notes:
Overview:
Sticky Notes
allow users to add highly visible notes to the workflow builder, providing quick access to important information. These notes stay pinned to the builder, making them useful for communicating critical information or reminders across teams working with the same contact.
How to use
:
Click on the "Sticky Notes" icon in the sidebar and select the colour of the note. The sticky note will populate in the builder.
Customization Options
:
Sticky Notes are highly customizable. Users can click the
Sticky Notes
icon to create notes with different colors, helping differentiate between various categories or types of tasks.
Rich Text Editor
:
A rich text editor is available for formatting text, making it easier to emphasize key points or structure your notes.
Attach Images
:
You can also attach images to Sticky Notes, making them more visually informative or detailed.
Visibility Controls
:
You can toggle the visibility of sticky notes by clicking the
"Hide Notes"
button. This allows users to decide if they want notes to be visible at all times or only when needed.
Use Cases
Workflow-Level Notes
: Ideal for adding high-level descriptions, objectives, and context to ensure everyone understands the workflow’s overall purpose.
Sticky Notes
: Use color-coded sticky notes to create task lists and visual reminders for your team, making it easy to track progress. They are also perfect for onboarding new users or guiding sub-account users through each action step-by-step.
Action-Level Notes
: Attach notes directly to actions to provide specific instructions, feedback, or background information. This ensures clarity and supports collaboration when different team members are involved in workflow management.
