Calendar Sync
The
Calendar Sync
tab allows you to sync your rental listing bookings with external calendar platforms. This prevents double-booking by automatically syncing availability between systems.
Features:
Import Calendar (iCal URL):
Add external iCal links (ending with .ics format to import bookings from third-party platforms. Imported bookings appear as blocked time slots within your Rentals calendar.
Export Calendar:
Generate and copy your unique iCal link to sync your Rentals availability with external platforms. This ensures that changes made in Rentals are reflected externally.
Sync Frequency:
Bookings from external platforms are imported automatically every 2 hours to keep availability accurate.
You can re-sync manually in between if needed using the "Refresh" action available against the imported calendar.
Pro Tip:
Always verify iCal links before saving to ensure synchronization between Rentals and external platforms functions properly.
Notes:
If a listing has variants enabled, the imported calendar will block slots for all the variants.
If inventory is enabled for a listing, the whole inventory is blocked for the time duration for which the booking is imported.
Save and Publish
Once you’ve completed setup:
Click
Save Changes
in the top-right corner.
Click
View Booking Page
to preview how the listing appears to customers.
Activate the listing when it’s ready to go live.
Tip:
Test listings on your Booking Website to confirm correct pricing, durations, and synchronization behavior.
