Frequently Asked Questions
Q: Who gets access to the LaunchPad for Agency Accounts?
A: All agency accounts on the $97, $297, and $497 plans are eligible. Currently, it’s being rolled out on a forward-going basis — meaning only new accounts created after the launch (5th June, 2025) will have access to the new LaunchPad version.
Q: What if I don’t see the LaunchPad when I log in?
A: The new LaunchPad is currently rolled out only to accounts created after its launch. So, if your account was created before 5th June 2025, it won’t have access to the new agency LaunchPad.
Q: Can I access the tutorial videos outside of the LaunchPad?
A: At this time, the videos are integrated into the LaunchPad experience and are not available as a standalone library.
Q: How does this impact onboarding for sub-accounts?
