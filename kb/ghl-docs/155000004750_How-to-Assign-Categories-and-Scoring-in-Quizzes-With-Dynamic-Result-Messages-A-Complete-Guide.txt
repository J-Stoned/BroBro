How to Add Scores in Quizzes
Step 1: Create or Edit a Quiz
Log into your account.
Navigate to Sites >  Quizzes.
Select an existing quiz or click + New Quiz to create a new one.
Step 2: Add Questions to the Quiz
Click Add Question and choose a question type (Single Choice, Multiple Choice, Dropdown, etc.).
Enter the question and possible answer choices.
For each answer choice, assign a score value based on how much weight it carries.
Step 3: Assign Scores to Categories
Create score categories (e.g., Category A, Category B, etc.).
Assign scores to each answer:
For Single Choice/Dropdown questions, assign a fixed score per answer.
For Multiple Choice/Multi Dropdown, assign a score per option that adds up if multiple choices are selected.
Assign each answer’s score to the relevant category.
If a question’s answer applies to multiple categories, select all that apply.
Step 4: Save and Preview
Click Save Quiz once you’ve set up all questions and scoring.
Use the Preview option to test the quiz and check if scores are calculated correctly.
How Quiz Scoring Works
Step 1: Set the Maximum Score for Each Question
Every question has a maximum score, which depends on its type:
Single Choice/Dropdown
: Only one answer can be selected, so the max score is fixed.
Multiple Choice/Multi Dropdown
: Multiple answers can be selected, so the max score is higher. The max score is fixed and it is the sum of all the options in the dropdown/multiple choice.
Example:
A Single Choice question might have a max score of 10.
A Multiple Choice question might allow up to 50 points.
Step 2: Assign Scores to Answers
When a quiz-taker selects an answer, it contributes to:
Overall Score Only: Counts toward the total quiz score but not any specific category.
Category-Specific Score: Counts toward both a specific category and the overall score.
Multiple Categories: Affects more than one category at the same time.
Example:
If a quiz has Category A, B, and C, and an answer is assigned to Category A, the score counts toward Category A and the Overall Score.
Step 3: Calculating the Final Score
Once all answers are selected, the final score is calculated using this formula:
Final Score = (Selected Score / Max Score) * 100
This is done separately for Overall Only and for each category.
Example Calculation
Category
Selected Score
Max Score
Final %
Final Score Formula
Overall
90
130
69.23%
Selected Score for Overall / Maximum Possible Score for Overall
Category A
20
50
40.00%
Selected Score for Category A / Maximum Possible Score for Category A
Category B
20
50
40.00%
Selected Score for Category B / Maximum Possible Score for Category B
Category C
10
50
20.00%
Selected Score for Category C / Maximum Possible Score for Category C
In this example:
The quiz-taker scored 69.23% overall.
For Category A, they scored 20 out of 50, resulting in 40%.
Key Takeaways About "Overall Only"
"Overall Only" is a Consolidated Score
If an answer is assigned only to "Overall Only," it doesn’t count towards any category.
If an answer is assigned to
both a category and "Overall Only,"
it is counted in both.
Categories Are Independent but Contribute to the Overall Score
Each category's score is calculated separately, but the
Overall Score is the sum of all category scores
.
Formula Breakdown
The
Final Score Formula
is calculated as:
Maximum Selected Score for X / Maximum possible score in each category
This applies across
Overall, Category A, Category B, etc.
to derive the percentage scores.
Add Dynamic Result Messages by Score Ranges
You can display different messages depending on a quiz taker’s score percentage.
Steps
Go to the
Result Page
in the quiz builder.
Define your
score ranges
(for example, Low: 0–40%, Medium: 41–70%, High: 71–100%).
Add a
custom message
for each range.
Optionally, add a
CTA
(subscribe, book a call, redirect to funnel, etc.).
Examples
Low: “There’s room for improvement. Let’s explore how we can help.”
Medium: “You’re on the right track. Here’s how to optimize further.”
High: “Awesome job! You nailed this. Let’s talk about next steps.”
Best Practices
Double-check category assignments if totals don’t add up.
Remember: Overall Only answers do not affect categories.
Always preview to confirm scoring accuracy.
