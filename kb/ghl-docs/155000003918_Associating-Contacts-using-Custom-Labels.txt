Frequently Asked Questions
What Are Contact Associations?
Contact Associations enable structured relationships between contacts and objects in HighLevel CRM. Instead of managing disconnected profiles, associations provide clear connections between related entities, such as spouses, managers, employees, or linked objects.
Types of Association Labels
Single Label:
A label that applies to both contacts in the association (e.g., “Colleague”).
Pair Labels:
Distinct labels for each contact in the relationship (e.g., “Manager” and “Employee,” “Buyer” and “Seller”).
Key Benefits of Contact Associations
Improved Contact Organization:
Associations provide a structured way to manage relationships between contacts, making it easier to track connections and access relevant information in one place.
Streamlined Communication:
By linking related contacts, businesses can quickly reference and reach out to connected individuals, ensuring smoother interactions and improved collaboration.
Enhanced Relationship Management:
Whether it’s family connections, business partnerships, or internal hierarchies, associations help businesses understand and manage relationships effectively.
Efficient CRM Workflow:
With clear associations in place, users can reduce duplicate data entry, quickly update linked contacts, and maintain a well-organized CRM system.
Where to View Contact Associations
Contact associations can be accessed in two main areas:
Contact Profile View:
Within a contact’s profile, the right-side panel contains the Associations icon, which displays related objects and linked contacts.
Objects Management Section:
The Settings > Objects > Contacts section provides an overview of all associations, enabling the creation and management of labels and relationships.
How to Create a Contact Associations
Creating associations involves a few steps:
Open the Objects Section
Go to Settings > Objects, then select Contacts.
Click "Create Association"
Select the "+ Create Association" button to define a new relationship.
Choose the Associated Object
Pick an object, such as Contacts, Surfboards, or another available entity.
Select the Label Type
Determine if the relationship requires a Single Label (e.g., "Partner") or Pair Labels (e.g., "Buyer - Seller").
Define the Relationship Type
Select between Many-to-Many or Many-to-One associations.
How to View / Link Contacts Using Associations
Once an association is created, linking contacts follows these steps:
Open a Contact Profile
Navigate to the Contacts section and select a contact’s profile.
Click the Association Icon
Located on the right-side panel, this provides access to association options.
Add the Relationship
Click “Add”, select the relevant contact, and assign an appropriate label.
Confirm the Association
The linked contact appears in the Related Objects section, and the association updates both profiles automatically.
Managing and Editing Associations
Editing an Existing Association

Removing an Association
Within a Contact Profile, navigate to the Related Objects section, locate the associated contact, and remove the link.
