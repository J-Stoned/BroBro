How to Enable PayPal in the Payment Element
Step 1:
Connect Your PayPal Account
Navigate to
Payments > Integrations
in your HighLevel dashboard.
Click on
PayPal
and enter your
Client ID
and
Secret Key
obtained from your PayPal developer account.
Save the integration settings.
Step 2:
Add or
Update the Payment Element
If you are collecting payments in your forms, surveys, websites, or funnels, simply add the payment element to enable PayPal buttons during the checkout experience.
If you already have a payment element and are now adding PayPal as a payment option, ensure that your Payment Element is updated to the latest version that supports PayPal.
Note :
If you are collecting payments in your
Forms or Surveys
, add the
“Collect Payment”
element to enable PayPal buttons during the checkout experience.
If you are collecting payments in your
Funnels or Websites
, use the
1-Step or 2-Step Order Form
elements instead. These now support PayPal automatically — no additional payment element is needed.
If you added the order form before Nov 1st, 2024, delete it and re-add it to ensure compatibility with PayPal.
Step 3:
Preview Payment Element
In order to see the PayPal buttons in your payment element, you will need to preview your form, survey, website, or funnel.
IMPORTANT:
You will
NOT
see the buttons when adding the payment element in the form, survey, website, or funnel builder.
