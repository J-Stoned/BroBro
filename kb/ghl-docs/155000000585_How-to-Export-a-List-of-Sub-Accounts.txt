Overview of Exporting Sub-Accounts List
The Sub-Accounts List Export feature enables agency teams to quickly generate CSV reports that include key details about all sub-accounts. This feature streamlines the process of obtaining comprehensive sub-account data, providing users with a simple solution to access and analyze vast amounts of information that would otherwise be time-consuming to gather manually.
It honors filters applied on the Sub-Accounts list, processes the file off-screen, and emails it to selected users once ready. By removing the need to keep your browser open and delivering a complete snapshot of your filtered view, it’s built for scale, accuracy, and team-wide sharing.
Key Benefits of the Sub-Accounts Export Feature

Off-Screen Processing

The exported data can be used to create comprehensive reports for clients, demonstrating the effectiveness of your strategies. This includes metrics like appointments booked, forms submitted, inbound and outbound communications, and more.
Strategizing Client Campaigns:
With details about social media engagement and customer interactions, you can better understand how audiences respond to your client's marketing efforts. This can guide improvements and adjustments to campaign strategies.
Resource Management
: Detailed metrics can reveal which clients or campaigns require the most resources, such as increased communications or appointments. This can help you better allocate your team's time and efforts.

Frequently Asked Questions
Q: Do exports include only the filtered sub-accounts?
Yes. The CSV respects all filters applied on the Sub-Accounts list at the time you start the export.
Q: How long do exports take?
Typical processing is 7–10 minutes, but large exports (thousands of sub-accounts) may take longer. You’ll receive an email when it’s ready.
Q: What happens if the email link expires?
Links expire after 7 days. Run the export again to generate a fresh link.
Q: Can I still download the file directly in the browser?
No. The export is processed asynchronously and delivered by email to selected recipients.
Q: How is this different from exporting contacts?
Contacts export is an in-app download scoped to a single sub-account. A sub-accounts list export is an agency-level CSV delivered by email and has information covering multiple sub-accounts
