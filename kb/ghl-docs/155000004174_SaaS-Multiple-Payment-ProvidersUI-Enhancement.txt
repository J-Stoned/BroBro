Overview
The sub-account billing page has been improved to make it easier for SaaS (Software as a Service) sub-accounts with payment options other than Stripe. Here’s what’s new:
Updated SaaS Activation Process
When an agency manually enables SaaS for a sub-account, they can now select which account type—either a Stripe account or an agency account—will handle the subscription and payment tasks. Once they choose, the billing system will automatically use the default payment provider from that account.
Flexible Payment Options
Agencies can now set a specific payment provider for each SaaS sub-account. When a sub-account admin adds a payment method, it will be saved with the agency’s selected provider for that sub-account.
Charges and Invoices
Sub-accounts now have easy access to their charges and invoices right on the billing page. They can see all charges, including those related to SaaS services and others, linked to their account.
Billing Address
When sub-account admins add a billing address, it will be automatically saved with their account information, making it easy to manage and retrieve when needed.
