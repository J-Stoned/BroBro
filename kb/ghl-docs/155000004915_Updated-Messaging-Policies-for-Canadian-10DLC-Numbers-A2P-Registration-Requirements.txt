To align with industry standards, we are updating our messaging policies concerning Canadian 10-digit long code (10DLC) numbers.
These changes pertain to messages sent from Canadian numbers to recipients in both the United States and Canada.
Key Changes:
Messaging from Canada to the United States:
Effective immediately, all messages sent from Canadian 10DLC numbers to U.S. recipients must originate from Application-to-Person (A2P) registered numbers. This requirement applies to both new and existing Canadian numbers.
Messaging within Canada:
For new Canadian 10DLC numbers purchased after 26th March 2025, A2P registration is mandatory to send messages to Canadian recipients.
Existing Canadian 10DLC numbers used for messaging within Canada are not required to undergo A2P registration at this time, except as noted in point 1.
Important Notes:
These updates apply exclusively to 10DLC numbers. Toll-Free (TF) numbers are not affected and will continue to operate under existing guidelines.
Understanding A2P 10DLC Registration:
A2P 10DLC is a system that allows businesses to send Application-to-Person type messaging via standard 10-digit long code phone numbers.
Registering your numbers under this framework helps ensure compliance with carrier regulations and enhances message deliverability.
For a comprehensive overview of A2P 10DLC and answers to common questions, please refer to our
support article.
Action Steps:
For Existing Canadian 10DLC Numbers Messaging to the U.S.:
If your number is not yet A2P registered, please initiate the registration process promptly to comply with the new requirements.
For New Canadian 10DLC Numbers:
Ensure A2P registration is completed before initiating messaging to recipients in either the U.S. or Canada.
For Toll-Free Numbers:
No action is required; existing policies remain in effect.
How to Register:
To register your Canadian 10DLC numbers for A2P messaging, please follow the step-by-step instructions provided in our
Campaign Registration Guide
.
This guide offers detailed information on the registration process, including best practices to ensure approval.
