Advanced Filtering in the Sub-Accounts List
The
new Sub-Accounts List UI
in HighLevel now includes an
Advanced Filter
option, available to agency users on the
$97 and $297 plans
. These filters help you quickly find sub-accounts based on specific platform features, configurations, or status.
Step 1:
Add a Basic Filter
Click on the
Filter(Funnel)
button at the top of the Sub-Accounts List.
The
Advanced Filters panel
will slide open, displaying four filter categories:
General
(e.g., Date Added, Snapshots)
Reselling
(e.g., Listings, WhatsApp, Email, AI tools)
Rebilling
(e.g., Email/Phone Verification, LC Premium)
LeadConnector
(e.g., LC Email, LC Phone)
Click on any
Search
Filed
of your choice under any of the above four categories.
Select the
Conditions
you want to filter by for the particular search filed.
Add an
OR Logic filter
by clicking the
+ Add Filter
button.
OR Logic:
At least one condition must be true for a result to be shown. Filters are applied so that data matching any one of the conditions is included.
Example:
If you filter by (
LC Email is Enabled or LC Phone is Enabled), this will return sub-accounts that have either LC Email or LC Phone enabled (or both).
Step 2:
Add Nested Filters (Optional)
Click on the
+ Add Nested Filter
button.
This filter works on the
AND Logic.
And Logic:
All conditions must be true for a result to be shown. Filters are combined so that the data must match every specified condition.
Example:
If you filter by (Date Added after Jan 1 and LC Email is Enabled), this will only show sub-accounts that were added after Jan 1 and also have LC Email enabled.
Step 3:
Apply and Review Filter Results
Click
Apply
to run the filters.
The system will return matching sub-accounts. If no results match, a message will appear:
“No more locations found.”
Bulk Actions for Sub-Account Management
Bulk actions allow agencies to efficiently manage multiple sub-accounts at once, reducing repetitive manual work.
Use checkboxes to select individual sub-accounts or click on the
Select
all
check box.
Once you have selected desired sub-accounts, click on the
Bulk
Actions
dropdown.
You have two bulk actions available:
Pause Sub-Account
and
Enable Rebilling
.
Click on the
Bulk Action History
(Clock) icon to see previous bulk action logs.
