This guide will:
Help you understand some of the rules that apply to SMS marketing (US and Canada).
Maximize the impact of SMS for:
Client responses
Marketing ppt Ins
Appointment conversions
Closing sales
Composing Your Message
Compliance in your SMS body
Seek consent from your text recipient before including them in your SMS campaign
Always identify yourself and your business by name.
If it’s the first time you’re messaging a contact, OR if it’s been 90 days or more since you last messaged them, be sure to add an unsubscribe clause at the very end of your message.
“Reply STOP to opt out.”
“If you’d like us to stop texting you, just reply STOP.”
If someone opts out of receiving future texts, be sure to remove them from your future SMS campaigns!
Strategic Best Practices
Greet each contact by using the first name custom value → {{contact.first_name}}
Use sparingly, no more than once per month
Respect people’s time and attention by only sending in specific time windows that are least likely to disturb personal time
For measurable results, use a strong offer
Make your message clear and concise to avoid turning people off and increasing unsubscribes.
Consider offering something for free to maximize interest or responses
Minimal commitment now = maximum number of conversations that will build trust and belief throughout the sales process
Keep messages short and exciting
Think about how your message will make the average contact feel
Avoid needless punctuation, specifically overuse of exclamation points, to increase reading speed
Avoid formal writing styles and match the casual tone of a typical text message conversation
Spark conversations
Creating live conversations = a direct connection with a potential customer
It builds trust
Which leads to increased sales momentum
Which builds your reputation
Ask a direct question to prompt responses
Do not ask more than one question, as this can cause confusion
Do not overuse emojis
Avoid sending links
This can cause deliverability issues
It also neglects all the great benefits of chat conversations
Only send out messages when you know you can respond in a timely manner
Contacts who respond right away and then never hear back will think your message was sent in bulk or spam
As such, contacts who get responses right away will be more likely to convert
Be prepared for unsubscribes
You will always get some people responding STOP
You will always get some people to ask not to be texted anymore
Respect their wishes, mark them DND, and move on
Bad Example
“Hello, this is Ashley from Bob’s Fitness ?? We’re the best gym in town! All our members are models! It’s ? $175/month ? to join and there’s an extra $150 new member fee ?… We have a lot of spots to fill so we hope you can afford it! We also have personal training, group classes, a 6 week challenge, nutrition plans, sauna, ice baths, an inner circle club, work-trade spots available, and many other add-ons!”
Good Example
“Hi {{contact.first_name}}, this is Ashley from Bob’s Fitness, we’re giving out a few 10-day passes and I wondered if you’d like one? If you’d like for us to stop texting you, reply STOP”

Click the “Send SMS” button (picture of icon)
Click “Ok, Proceed”
Type your message
Title the action for internal reference
If you want to send the message to everyone at the same time immediately, leave the toggle on “Send all at once.”
This is good for 1-way announcements you do not expect to turn into conversations and want to send right away.
If you want to send the message to everyone at the same time later, select “Send all at schedule time” and then set the send time in the “Start On” field.
This is good for 1-way announcements you do not expect to turn into conversations and want to send automatically at a later time
If you want to slowly deliver the message to the list of contacts over time, select “Send in drip mode”
This is good for messages you expect to generate responses and conversations
