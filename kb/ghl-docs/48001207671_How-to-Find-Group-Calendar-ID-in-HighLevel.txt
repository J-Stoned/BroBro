Frequently Asked Questions
Q: Can I use the same Calendar ID in multiple workflows?
Yes! As long as the workflows are connected to the same Group Calendar, the Calendar ID can be reused in different workflows and integrations.
Q: Are Calendar IDs the same for all users in the sub-account?
Yes. The Calendar ID is tied to the calendar itself and remains the same regardless of the user accessing it, as long as they have permission.
Q: Will the Calendar ID change if I rename the calendar?
No, renaming the calendar will not affect the Calendar ID. The ID remains constant regardless of the calendar’s display name.
Q: What if the Calendar ID format changes?
HighLevel will notify users of any changes to calendar structures or URL formats. Bookmark this article to stay updated.
Q: What if I deleted a calendar? Will the ID still work?
No, once a calendar is deleted, its ID becomes invalid. Any references to that ID in workflows or integrations will stop functioning.
Q: Can I use Calendar IDs to filter bookings in the API?
Yes, if you're pulling data from the API, you can use the Calendar ID to filter bookings or appointment data for a specific calendar.
