Learn how to promote HighLevel as a new Affiliate
So, you've recently become an affiliate, and you’re ready to get started sharing HighLevel with your colleagues...
LET'S DO THIS!
3 Easy Ways To Promote Highlevel & Build Your Income
1. Leverage the TEMPLATE - Agency snapshot
The Agency snapshot has everything you need to get colleagues on your calendar so you demo HighLevel and answer any questions they might have, including an outreach campaign and a landing page with a non-branded demo video.
To get started, just follow the Agency Snapshot Setup Guide then upload your colleagues into Contacts then
bulk-request
(or
manually add
) them into the A) Potential Affiliate Nurture campaign.
2. Make "[old service] Vs. HighLevel" Blog Posts & YouTube Videos
As HighLevel grows, more and more people are searching for comparison articles and videos to learn more about the benefits to be had by leaving the tools they currently use for HighLevel. The more in-depth your articles/videos, the better chance they have of being shared and to rank in search results.
Be sure to hyperlink all mentions of HighLevel with your affiliate link and be sure to add your affiliate link to the video description and embed your video into your comparison articles!
3. Make "Why I switched From [old service] To HighLevel Blog Posts & YouTube Videos
Just like with strategy #2, the more of these you make, the better chance you'll have of curious marketers finding them in search results then clicking through you affiliate link.
Be sure to hyperlink all mentions of HighLevel with your affiliate link and be sure to add your affiliate link to the video description and embed your video into your comparison articles!
