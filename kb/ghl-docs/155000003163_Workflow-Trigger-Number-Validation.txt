Example
SMS Campaign Management
: When a phone number is validated and found to be SMS-capable, the trigger can automatically add the contact to an active SMS campaign. Conversely, if the number is invalid or not SMS-capable, the trigger can remove that contact from the campaign to prevent wasted resources on undeliverable messages.
Lead Qualification
: If a lead submits a phone number through a form, the validation trigger can check the number's status. If the number is invalid, the lead can be tagged as "invalid" or removed from the database. This helps maintain a clean and effective lead list.
Error Notifications
: The trigger can be set up to notify the marketing team whenever a validation error occurs. For instance, if a number fails validation due to being a landline, an automated message can be sent to the team to review the lead's information and take appropriate action.
Compliance Management
: In scenarios where compliance with regulations like the TCPA is critical, the validation trigger can prevent sending messages to numbers that are flagged as invalid. This helps mitigate risks associated with sending unsolicited messages and ensures that the communication strategy adheres to legal standards.
Automated Tagging
: Upon validation, the trigger can automatically tag contacts based on the validation result. For example, numbers that are confirmed as invalid can be tagged as "Do Not Contact," allowing for easier management of outreach efforts.
