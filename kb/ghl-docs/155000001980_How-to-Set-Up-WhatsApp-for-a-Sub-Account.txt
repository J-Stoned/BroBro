Agency Setup
Pre-requisites for Auto-Reselling
Connect your Agency Stripe Account
Your agency Stripe account will be used to collect subscription payments for WhatsApp from your clients. You can connect your agency Stripe account to your agency by following this helpful article:
How to Connect Stripe to Agency
.
Note: You can also
Direct Deploy WhatsApp
if you do not have a Stripe connected. However, this will charge your agency Card on file, skipping the reselling feature.
How to set Set Reselling Amount in High Level.
Setting Up Reselling
In the reselling tab of agency settings, you can offer WhatsApp and set your pricing for subaccounts. This allows you to charge your clients a markup while HighLevel bills you at a fixed rate. When a client wants to, they can then purchase WhatsApp at this marked-up price. Allowing you to recoup the HighLevel price we charge you and then make a profit every month.
After setting this up in the Agency, a Sub-Account can purchase it themselves, which will then charge the card on file for that Sub-Account.
Direct Deployment (Skipping Reselling the WhatsApp subscription)
If you want to skip the reselling, that is if you do want, your sub accounts to pay the WhatsApp subscription charges, you can direct deploy WhatsApp to a specific Sub-Account without reselling markups, you can do this from the Manage Sub-Account Tab. This will charge your Agency Card on file, located in your Company Billing Tab.
Navigate to the Agency View > Sub-Accounts > Find the Sub-Account, then click Manage Sub-Account
Scroll down to Re-Sell WhatsApp, then check the Deploy directly box, then Pay Now. This will charge your Agency Card on file, located in your Company Billing Tab.

WhatsApp Conversations
Unless a customer sends you a message, you must utilize a Template to send a new message to a customer. In general, there are two ways to open a WhatsApp conversation (1) when a customer messages you or (2) when you message a template to a customer.
Types of WhatsApp Conversations
Business-Initiat
ed:
Messages sent by businesses to customers using a template. There are four categories of templates and the templates are created and reviewed by Facebook Meta before they can be used. You can only send templates to customers until they respond, if they do not respond, you can only send templates.
Customer-Initiated:
Messages initiated by the customers sending a message to the business. When a customer messages you, it opens up a 24-hour window where you can send any template or free-form message to them.
Free Entry Conversations:
Initiated when customers interact with a WhatsApp Ad or a Facebook Business Page WhatsApp Action Button, allowing for a 72-hour window for businesses to respond. The business must respond within 24 hours of customer free point entry, after the business responds, the 72-hour timer begins.
Conversation (Template) Categories
When opening a new Business-initiated conversation, you must utilize a Template. First, you
create a WhatsApp template in HighLevel
. The template will be reviewed and approved (or denied) by Facebook Meta. Below we will review the types of template categories.
Marketing
— Enables you to achieve a wide range of goals, from generating awareness to driving sales and retargeting customers. Examples include new product, service, or feature announcements, targeted promotions/offers, and cart abandonment reminders.
Utility
— Enables you to follow-up on user actions or requests. Examples include opt-in confirmation, order/delivery management (e.g., delivery update); account updates or alerts (e.g., payment reminder); or feedback surveys.
Authentication (To be Released)
— This enables you to authenticate users with one-time passcodes, potentially at multiple steps in the login process (e.g., account verification, account recovery, integrity challenges).
Service (To be Released)
— Enables you to resolve customer inquiries.

Template Categorization Guidelines.
How to Create a WhatsApp Template
Templates are used to begin business-initiated conversations, though this is not their only use. You will need to create and have Meta (owner of WhatsApp) approve your templates.

WhatsApp Overview
Nearly everything you need to know about WhatsApp.
Introduction
Welcome to this comprehensive guide on WhatsApp. In this video, we'll cover everything from setting up your account, understanding sending limits and pricing, to utilizing WhatsApp efficiently within High Level. Let's dive in!
What is WhatsApp and Why Does it Matter?
WhatsApp is a messaging platform which boasts over 2 billion users globally. Unlike SMS, WhatsApp is worldwide, anyone with a WhatsApp account and internet connection can use it. Further, WhatsApp can be significantly cheaper than standard SMS messages.
Subaccount Setup
When setting up WhatsApp within a subaccount, you'll need a Facebook Meta business account and a WhatsApp Business profile. Follow the prompts to link accounts and fill in business information.
You will need a
Facebook Account
and a
Facebook Meta Business Account
. (Learn what a Meta Business Account is
here
.)
Opening a New Conversation
Unless a customer sends you a message, you must utilize a Template to send a new message to a customer. Until a customer responds, you can only send approved templates to customers.
For example, in HighLevel, unless the customer sends you a message within 24 hours, you will see a prompt to send a template. You can only send templates until the customer responds.
Conversations are opened when you send a template message or free-form message under the following conditions.
[Business-Initiated] Marketing, Utility, and Authentication Conversations
Marketing, utility, and authentication conversations are opened when you send an approved marketing, utility, or authentication template message to a customer and no open conversation with that category exists between you and that customer.
For example, if an open authentication conversation exists between you and a customer and you send them another authentication template message within 24 hours, a new conversation is not opened. If you send them a marketing message, however, a new marketing conversation is opened, resulting in two open conversations.
[Business-Initiated] Service Conversations
Service conversations are opened when you are within a customer service window, you send a free-form message to a customer, and no open conversation of any category exists between you and the customer.
For example, if an open conversation of any category exists between you and a customer and you send them a free-form message within 24 hours, no new conversation is opened. However, if no open conversation exists and the customer messages you (which starts a customer service window) and you reply within 24 hours with a free-form message, a new service conversation is opened.
[Customer-Initiated] Customer Service Windows
When a customer messages you, a 24-hour timer called a customer service window starts. If you are within the window, you can send free-form messages or template messages. If you are outside the window, you can only send template messages.
Multiple Conversations
It is possible to have multiple open conversations between you and a customer. This can happen in the following situations:
An open marketing, utility, or authentication conversation exists between you and a customer and you send them a template message of a different category within 24 hours.
An open service conversation exists between you and a customer and you send them a template message within 24 hours.
Duration of Conversations
Marketing, utility, authentication, and service conversations last 24 hours unless closed by a newly opened free-entry point conversation.
Free-entry point conversations last 72 hours.
WhatsApp Pricing
Unlike SMS, WhatsApp charges per conversation. Only business-initiated conversations are charged. The charge varies depending on the Template Category and country. All Customer-initiated or Free point conversations are free and are not charged. You must have a WhatsApp Subscription on the Sub-Account as well, which is charged the HighLevel Price of $10/mo.
[WhatsApp Sub-Account Subscription]:
$10/mo
[New Business-Initiated Conversation]:
The amount charged is based on the template category used and the recipient's country.
[Free Entry Point Pricing]:
No charge
