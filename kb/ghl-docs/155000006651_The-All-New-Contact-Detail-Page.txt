What is the All-New Contact Detail Page?
Re-engineered from the ground up, the Contact Detail Page is the central workspace where you can review contact information, track conversations, log activities, and launch actions—now optimized for speed and usability.

Auto-Save: How It Works
Auto-Save is one of the most powerful new additions.
When enabled,
your edits are saved automatically
the moment you leave a field — no manual “Save” click required.
Steps
: Open any contact record. Make an edit — you’ll see a
Save bar
appear at the bottom. Click on "Enable Auto-Save" from the kebab (3 dots) menu.
Click
“Enable Auto-Save”
when prompted.
Confirm from the modal — this will apply the setting to your sub-account. Admins can also enable or disable Auto-Save from:
Settings → Contacts → Details Tab → Auto-Save toggle
Once enabled, all users in the sub-account will automatically save edits as they work.
Keyboard Shortcuts
Save time with these new shortcuts:

— Move between contacts in the list.
ESC
— Collapse right panel.
CTRL + S (or CMD + S)
— Manual save (if Auto-Save is off).
Associations: Companies, Opportunities & Custom Objects
View and edit company details on the same page.
Access all custom object relationships at a glance.
