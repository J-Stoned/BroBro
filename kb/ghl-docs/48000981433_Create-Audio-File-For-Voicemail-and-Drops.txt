What is a Custom Voicemail
The system has pre-recorded messages and it can do speech to text. A custom voicemail is where you record your own audio and upload the file. This file can be played instead of a system file as your voicemail message or it can be used in voicemail drops where you leave a message in someone else's voicemail (usually a customer).
