What is Auto Refresh of Knowledge Base Trained Links?
Auto Refresh is a feature in HighLevel that schedules automatic re-training of the web URLs you’ve added to your Knowledge Base. Instead of manually clicking
Refresh
for each URL, HighLevel periodically re-crawls the pages, updates the table data, and re-indexes the fresh content your bot relies on. This ensures your bot can reference up-to-date product pages, help docs, and blog articles without manual maintenance.
Auto Refresh removes the need for recurring manual updates and reduces the risk of outdated answers. By continuously syncing your Knowledge Base URLs on a schedule, the feature helps your bot deliver consistent, reliable responses drawn from the most recent source material.
Key Benefits of Auto Refresh
Understanding the benefits helps you decide the right cadence and scope. These advantages focus on accuracy, time savings, and operational visibility, especially for teams managing many links across multiple sub-accounts.
Always-current answers:
Ensures the bot uses the latest content for higher accuracy and reliability.
Time savings at scale:
Reduces manual refresh work, especially when managing many URLs across sub-accounts.
Fewer outdated responses:
Prevents stale instructions, prices, or policies from reaching customers.
Lower risk of human error:
Automates repetitive refresh tasks so one missed click doesn’t leave sources stale.
Predictable scheduling:
Choose Daily, Weekly, or Monthly cadences to match your content update rhythm.
Load management:
Stagger refreshes to avoid peak-time crawling and manage performance on large sites.
Setting the Refresh Frequency
Scheduling controls how often HighLevel automatically re-crawls your URLs. Choose a frequency that aligns with how frequently your source content updates and the size of your URL library.
Click the
Auto Refresh
icon (circular arrows) and select your preferred schedule:
Daily:
Refreshes approximately every 24 hours.
Weekly:
Refreshes on the same weekday you select.
Monthly:
Refreshes on the same calendar day each month.
Monitoring Refresh Status & Logs
Visibility into each crawl cycle helps you validate that refreshes are working and quickly resolve errors that would otherwise leave stale content in place.
The
Status
column reflects the current state of each URL:
Getting Data:
HighLevel is actively re-crawling the page.
Trained:
The latest data was saved; check
Last data refreshed at
for the timestamp.
Failed:
The crawl encountered an error; retry the refresh or review page accessibility.

Best Practices for a Healthy Knowledge Base
Following these best practices improves crawl reliability, reduces failures, and helps your bot serve more accurate answers at scale.
Use stable URLs:
Avoid addresses that frequently redirect or require login to view content.
Keep pages lightweight:
Extremely long or script-heavy pages may crawl slowly and can hit timeouts.
Audit failures weekly:
Investigate rows stuck in
Failed
; fix broken links and retry.
Stagger heavy sites:
For large libraries, prefer
Weekly
or
Monthly
to spread load over time.
Prioritize critical pages:
Set
Daily
for pages that change often and directly affect customers.
