What is Custom Fields for Opportunities?
Custom Fields for Opportunities allow you to add, manage, and organize additional data points in your sales pipeline beyond the default fields provided by HighLevel. This feature ensures your pipeline reflects the unique aspects of your business process.
You can create text, dropdown, date, monetary, and other field types, categorize them into folders, and even hide empty fields for a cleaner view. These fields then become usable in filtering, reporting, and automation to streamline workflows.
Key Benefits of Custom Fields for Opportunities
Custom Fields give you control over how you track and organize opportunities, making your CRM a more powerful tool.
Personalization:
Capture information specific to your business, such as budget, preferences, or product details.
Organization:
Group fields into folders and reorder them for easier data management.
Efficiency:
Use the “hide empty fields” option to keep pipeline views clean and focused.
Better Reporting:
Include custom fields in dashboards, widgets, and reports for deeper insights.
Filtering Power:
Filter and sort opportunities by custom criteria to quickly prioritize leads.
Automation:
Use custom fields in workflows, campaigns, and merge fields to save time.
How to Create and Manage Custom Fields
Creating and managing custom fields ensures your team captures the right details for every opportunity.
Accessing Custom Fields
There are two ways to reach the Custom Fields dashboard in HighLevel. Both methods take you to the same place, so you can choose whichever is more convenient.
Via Settings
From your sub-account dashboard, open the
Settings
menu and scroll down to select
Custom Fields
. This will take you directly to the Custom Fields dashboard.
Via Opportunity
Inside the
Opportunities
section, select any existing opportunity and click
Add/Manage Fields
. This shortcut redirects you to the same Custom Fields dashboard, making it quick to edit while reviewing an opportunity.
Creating New Custom Field
Creating custom fields allows you to capture details unique to your sales process directly within opportunities. From client budgets to follow-up dates, these fields give you the flexibility to customize your pipeline and ensure important information is always tracked.
Add Field
Click the
+ Add Field
button at the top right of the Custom Fields dashboard. This begins the process of creating a new custom field for opportunities or other objects.
Choose Field Type
Select from various field types to match your data needs. Options include
text inputs
(single line, multi-line, list),
values
(number, phone, monetary),
choices
(dropdowns, radio, checkbox),
date/time
(date picker), and
other inputs
like file upload or signature.
Field Type
Example Use Case
Single Line
Enter the project name or client company name.
Multi Line
Add detailed notes about client requirements.
Text Box List
Track multiple product SKUs associated with an opportunity.
Number
Record a probability score for conversion (e.g., 80%).
Phone
Save an alternate decision-maker’s phone number.
Monetary
Store the client’s budget or estimated deal value.
Dropdown (Single)
Select the sales stage (e.g., Negotiation, Closing).
Dropdown (Multiple)
Mark all products/services a client is interested in.
Radio Select
Capture yes/no style responses like “Is Budget Approved?”.
Checkbox
Flag if contracts or compliance documents are required.
Date Picker
Track key dates like follow-up or projected close date.
File Upload
Attach proposal files or client RFP documents.
Signature
Collect signed approvals directly within the opportunity.
After selecting the appropriate field type, click
Next
to continue setting up the custom field.
Assign to Opportunity
After naming your field, set the
Object
to
Opportunity
so the field applies specifically within opportunity records. Once all details are filled in, click
Save
to create the new custom field.
Other Fields
Name:
The display label for the custom field (e.g., “Client Budget”).
Group:
Folder or category to organize the field under (e.g., “Budget Details”).
Placeholder:
A hint text shown inside the field when it’s empty (e.g., “Enter estimated value”).
Additional Preferences:
Advanced options for certain field types (e.g., default values, required toggle).
Click the
Save
button to finalize your new custom opportunity field. Once saved, the field becomes available for use across opportunity records in your pipeline.
Tip:
If you mistakenly assign the field to
Contact
instead of
Opportunity
, it will only appear in contact records and won’t show in your pipeline opportunities.
Creating a Folder
Folders make it easy to organize multiple custom fields into logical groups. By creating folders, you can keep related fields together, reduce clutter, and make it simpler for your team to find and update the right information inside opportunities.
Add Folder
Click the
Add Folder
button at the top right of the Custom Fields dashboard. Folders help you organize related fields, making them easier to manage and locate.
Name the Folder
Enter a descriptive name for your folder (e.g., “Budget Details” or “Product Info”). A clear name ensures your team knows exactly what type of fields belong inside.
Select Object
Choose
Opportunity
as the object so the folder applies specifically to opportunity records. This ensures all fields created under this folder appear in opportunities rather than contacts or other objects.
Click
Save
after finalizing the folder name and object.
Managing Custom Fields
Once your custom fields and folders are created, you can manage them effectively by reordering, filtering, grouping, or deleting. These tools help keep your opportunities organized and make it easier to find the right information.
Filter by Object
Use the dropdown at the top right to filter custom fields by
object type
(e.g., Opportunity, Contact, Company). Selecting
Opportunity
ensures you only see fields linked to opportunities, making it easier to focus on what’s relevant for pipeline tracking.
Group by Folder
Use the
Group By
dropdown to organize custom fields by folder or category. This makes it easier to view fields based on context—for example, grouping all budget-related fields under “Opportunity Details” or all client inputs under a specific form.
Bulk Actions
Select multiple custom fields using the checkbox menu and use the
Bulk Actions
menu to edit, delete, or move them into a different folder. This saves time when managing several fields at once instead of adjusting them individually.
Reorder Fields
Use the drag-and-drop
hamburger icon
to move custom fields up or down in the list. This allows you to control the order in which fields appear when creating or editing an opportunity.
Using Custom Fields in Opportunities Dashboard
Custom Fields are more than just data. they integrate into filtering, reporting, and pipeline views to make sales management easier.
Open Advanced Filters
In the
Opportunities
view, click
Advanced Filters
to start applying custom filters to your pipeline. This opens the filtering panel where you can refine results using both standard fields and your custom opportunity fields.
Filter by Custom Fields
Inside the filtering panel, scroll down to the
Opportunities Custom Fields
section. This area displays all the opportunity custom fields you’ve created, both existing and newly added so you can filter records based on the data that matters most to your pipeline.
Tip:
Combine multiple custom field filters to build precise views, such as identifying high-value leads that also meet specific qualification criteria.
Display Custom Fields on Opportunity Cards
Custom fields don’t just live inside the opportunity record, you can also make them visible on the pipeline cards. This ensures important details are available at a glance, helping your team work faster without opening each opportunity.
Open Manage Fields
In the
Opportunities
view, click the
Manage Fields
button at the top right. This opens the customization panel, where you can adjust which details appear on opportunity cards.
For adding custom fields, simply scroll down to the
Add Fields
section.
Add Custom Fields to Cards
Expand the
Opportunity Details
section under
Add Fields
and check the custom fields you want to add. These fields will now appear directly on the card, giving you quick visibility into information like budgets, task types, or client preferences.
Once you’ve selected the custom fields you want, click the
Apply
button at the bottom of the panel. Your opportunity cards will instantly update to reflect the new field selections.
Hide Empty Fields
Inside any opportunity card, you’ll see the option to
Hide Empty Fields
at the top. Enabling this keeps your view clean by showing only fields with values, so you can focus on the information that actually matters.
This is especially helpful if you use many custom fields but only need to review the ones actively filled out for each opportunity.
Frequently Asked Questions
Q: If I add or remove custom fields from the Opportunity card using the “Manage Fields” option, will this change apply to all users in the account?
No. Changes made in the
Manage Fields
panel apply only to your personal view of opportunity cards. Other users in the same sub-account will still see their own customized layouts unless they make adjustments themselves. This allows each user to display the fields most relevant to their role.
Q: What happens to existing data if I delete an opportunity custom field?
Deleting a custom field permanently removes the field and any data stored in it from all opportunities. This action cannot be undone. If you only want to hide a field without losing data, consider moving it into a folder or using the “Hide Empty Fields” option instead of deleting.
Q: Can all custom field types be used for filtering opportunities?
No. While most opportunity custom fields (such as dropdowns, numbers, dates, and text fields) can be used in filtering, certain field types like
File Upload
and
Signature
cannot be filtered. These fields still appear in opportunity records but won’t be available in the Advanced Filters panel.
Q: How can I use opportunity custom fields in automations or workflows?
Opportunity custom fields can be used as triggers, conditions, or actions in workflows. For example, you could:
Update a custom field automatically (e.g., increase “Likelihood of Conversion” based on lead activity).
Send personalized messages using merge fields that pull in opportunity custom field data.
Create rules that move opportunities to a new stage when a custom field meets specific criteria.
This integration ensures your custom data isn’t just stored—it actively drives automation in your pipeline.
