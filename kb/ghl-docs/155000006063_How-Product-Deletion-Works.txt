Frequently Asked Questions
What does this feature do?
Product deletion lets you permanently remove products you no longer need. To protect billing and customer access, the system blocks deletion for certain product types or when active/past_due subscriptions exist. In bulk actions, only eligible products are removed; protected items are skipped with clear messaging.
Please note that deleting products doesn't necessarily delete the products that are already sold i.e. transactions, orders, invoices, subscriptions, etc. that already have this product, will continue to do so. It would only block future purchases of or actions on the product.
What do I need to use this feature?
Permissions:
Role with
Products → Delete
(and
Products → View
).
Navigation:
Payments → Products
(list and details pages).
Awareness:
Deletion is
permanent
and cannot be undone. Ensure the product isn’t required in active checkouts or by Calendars/Memberships or active SaaS subscription.
How to delete a product
Option 1: From the Products List
Go to
Payments → Products
.
Locate the product.
Click the
Delete (trash)
icon.
Confirm in the dialog.
Option 2: From the Product Details page (Price / Variant deletion)
Go to
Payments → Products → Edit
Click
Delete Price
. Note - This would only work if there is more than 1 price / variant available of the product, the last price / variant cannot be deleted.
Note:
If the delete control is disabled or you see a message about eligibility, review the “Restrictions” section below.
How to bulk delete products
Go to
Payments → Products
.
Select multiple products with the checkboxes (or
Select All

Click
Delete
under
Bulk Actions
.

Confirmation messages (what you’ll see):
“Are you sure you want to delete these products? This action cannot be undone. Only products eligible for deletion will be deleted.”
If a fixed count is shown (e.g., 10 selected):
“Are you sure you want to delete these 10 products? This action cannot be undone. Only products eligible for deletion will be deleted.”
Only eligible products are deleted; protected products remain.
Restrictions: what you cannot delete (and why)

SaaS products (SaaS Plans & Agency Plans)

Unsaved
(just added, not saved yet) prices/variants:
can
be removed.
Frequently Asked Questions
Q: Why is the delete button not visible against my product?
A: It’s either a Calendars or Memberships/Communities product (never deletable), or it’s a SaaS product with active/past_due subscriptions.
Q: How do I delete a SaaS product that’s blocked?
A: First resolve or cancel all
active/past_due
subscriptions tied to that product. Once none remain, the product can be deleted.
Q: What happens in bulk delete if my selection includes protected products?
A: Only eligible products are deleted. Protected items are skipped, and the confirmation dialog clarifies this behavior.
Q: Can I delete a price/variant on a protected product?
A: You can remove it only if it has
not
been saved yet. Saved prices/variants on SaaS, Calendars, or Memberships/Communities products cannot be deleted.
Q: Is deletion reversible?
A: No. Deletion is permanent. Confirm dependencies before proceeding.
