What Are Opportunities?
Opportunities are records that represent a potential sale or deal at any point in your pipeline—from a brand‑new lead to a signed contract. Each opportunity stores the prospect’s contact information, deal value, and historical notes, ensuring everyone on your team has context and can take action quickly. Opportunities move through stages inside a pipeline, reflecting real‑world progress toward a win.
Note:
In HighLevel, a contact becomes an opportunity when there's a prospect of a sale or deal associated with that contact and it is added to a sales pipeline.
Key Benefits of Opportunities
Opportunities allow you to organize, automate, and forecast your sales in one place.
Centralized Tracking:
All notes, tasks, and communications live on the opportunity card, eliminating data silos.
Stage‑Based Forecasting:
Predict revenue by looking at how many deals sit in each stage and their expected values.
Automation Triggers:
Fire workflows when an opportunity is created, moves stages, or changes status—saving hours of manual work.
Team Collaboration:
Assign owners, tag teammates, and track activity history without endless email threads.
Performance Reporting:
Use the HighLevel dashboards and reports to see win rates and bottlenecks across reps or products.
Pipeline Integration
Opportunities are managed within pipelines which in turn are series of consecutive stages.
Customizable pipelines align with unique sales processes and business goals.

Opportunity Status
"Open", "Won", "Lost" and "Abandoned" are opportunity status which are present by default.
An opportunity can be in one of the four statuses and we can use these to prepare filters for the same.
Open:
Opportunities with the "Open" status are actively being pursued and are still in progress. These opportunities represent potential deals that have not yet been won, lost, or abandoned and are still viable for conversion.
Won:
The "Won" status indicates that the opportunity has been successfully converted into a sale or deal. This status is applied when the lead has made a purchase or signed a contract, resulting in revenue generation for the business.
Lost:
Opportunities with the "Lost" status represent deals that have been unsuccessfully concluded. This status is applied when the lead decides not to move forward with the purchase or chooses a competitor's offering.
Abandoned:
The "Abandoned" status indicates that the opportunity has been neglected or disregarded, either by the lead or by the sales team. This status is applied when there is no further action or follow-up planned for the opportunity, and it is effectively removed from active consideration.
