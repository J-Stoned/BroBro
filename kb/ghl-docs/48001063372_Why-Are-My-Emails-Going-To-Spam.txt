There are many reasons that mailbox providers could flag your email as spam. Here are the most common reasons we see and how to fix them!
Sending From a Public Domain
If you are sending messages from a free domain like gmail.com, yahoo.com, etc., your messages will likely go to the spam folder. You'll want to be sure to send mail from a domain that you own and that matches your branding.

Dedicated Email Sending Domains Overview & Setup
DMARC
If the domain you use to send mail has a DMARC policy but you haven't verified the domain in with your SMTP provider, your messages will likely go to spam. Check with your SMTP provider for instructions on how to ensure your HighLevel messages pass DMARC.
List Health & List Collection
If all of the technical pieces above are covered, list health and list collection are the next most important factors to determine deliverability. Be sure that:
Everyone on your list gave direct consent to receive email marketing from you
Your cold subscribers are cleaned from your list regularly
Your forms are secured with double opt-in

Sending Internal Mail
Are you sending messages to the same domain that the message is coming from? For example, sending from info@exampledomain.com to suan@exampledomain.com. If so, it's common for these internal messages to go to spam. This is because your mailbox sees that it's receiving a message from itself, but it knows that it didn't send the message (HighLevel did). This makes your mailbox think it's being spoofed, and it sends the message to spam.
If you're just sending internal mail to test your messages, we recommend using a free email like gmail.com. If you need to send mail internally outside of testing, you'll want to have the person who manages mail for your domain whitelist the IP address of your SMTP provider.
Sending Volume or Frequency Issues
Mailbox providers monitor how often and how many emails you send. A sudden spike in sending volume may raise red flags.
How to fix it:
Warm up your sending domain gradually by increasing volume over time.
Maintain a consistent sending schedule.
Avoid sending long periods of silence followed by massive blasts.
Content Triggers Spam Filters
Even if your authentication is correct, the
content
of your email can trigger spam filters.
Things that may cause issues:
Overuse of promotional words (e.g., “Free $$$,” “Act Now,” “Limited Time”)
Too many images with very little text
Using link shorteners (like bit.ly)
Attachments with large files or unsupported formats
How to fix it:
Write in a
clear, conversational tone
.
Balance
images and text
.
Always link directly to your website instead of using link shorteners.
Frequently Asked Questions
Q: How can I test if my emails are going to spam before sending them to my list?
You can use email testing tools that analyze your email content and sender reputation. Additionally, consider sending test emails to different email providers (like Gmail, Yahoo, etc.) to see where they land.
Q: What steps can I take if my domain has a poor sender reputation?
Improving your domain's sender reputation involves several strategies, including gradually increasing your email sending volume, regularly cleaning your email list, and actively engaging with your audience to boost open rates.
Q: How often should I clean my email list to avoid spam issues?
It's recommended to clean your email list every 6 to 12 months. Regularly remove inactive subscribers and those who haven't engaged with your emails to maintain a healthy list and improve deliverability.
