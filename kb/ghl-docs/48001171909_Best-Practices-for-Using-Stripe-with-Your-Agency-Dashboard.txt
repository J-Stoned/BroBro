Integrating Stripe with your Agency Dashboard allows you to view key revenue metrics directly inside HighLevel. To ensure accurate and consistent data, follow these best practices:
1. Connect Your Existing Stripe Account
Always connect your
existing Stripe account
to your Agency Dashboard.
Only create a
new Stripe account
if absolutely necessary.
Keep in mind that
new accounts will display zeros
until transactions occur.
2. Currency Display Limitations
The Agency Dashboard currently
supports USD only
for product display.
If your connected Stripe account includes products in other currencies, the dashboard will:
Display the
gross total
, and
Label all values as USD (non-converted)
.
Tip:
For accurate reporting, consider maintaining a USD-based Stripe account when possible.
3. MRR Calculation Differences
You might notice small discrepancies between
Stripe’s MRR
and the
HighLevel dashboard’s MRR
.
These differences are minor and usually caused by how each platform handles:
The
average number of days per year
, and
Leap year adjustments
.
Note:
Both values should remain close over time.
4. Rounded and Shortened Monetary Values
To keep your dashboard clean and easy to read, HighLevel automatically
rounds and shortens
large numbers.
Example:
If Stripe reports
$3,232
,
HighLevel will display it as
$3.23k
.
This formatting does
not affect actual revenue calculations
—it’s purely a visual simplification.
✅
In summary:
Use your existing Stripe account, remember that all data shows in USD, expect some MRR variations, and note that amounts are visually shortened for readability.
