A privacy policy explains how your business collects, uses, and protects personal information—like names, phone numbers, or emails. It’s not just good practice—it’s often legally required under laws like GDPR, CCPA, and A2P 10DLC carrier regulations. HighLevel gives you multiple ways to link your privacy policy wherever you're collecting data from users.
