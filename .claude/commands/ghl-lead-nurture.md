### Step 3: Generate Three Preset Nurture Templates

Based on KB research, generate 3 complete nurture sequences optimized for different conversion goals:

## Template 1: Cold-to-Warm Nurture

**Best For:** Brand new leads with no prior relationship. Goal: Build trust and educate.

**Structure:**
```
Day 1: Introduction & Value Delivery
- Subject: "Welcome! Here's what to expect..."
- Content: Set expectations, deliver promised lead magnet, introduce brand
- Psychology: Fulfill promise immediately (build trust)

Day 3: Education & Problem Awareness
- Subject: "The [#1 mistake] [niche] businesses make..."
- Content: Identify common problem, show you understand their pain
- Psychology: Problem awareness → solution awareness

Day 5: Social Proof & Credibility
- Subject: "How [Customer Name] achieved [specific result]..."
- Content: Case study, testimonials, quantifiable results
- Psychology: "If they did it, I can too"

Day 7: Value-First Content
- Subject: "Quick tip: [Actionable advice]"
- Content: Free, actionable advice they can implement today
- Psychology: Reciprocity (give before asking)

Day 10: Soft CTA with Stakes
- Subject: "Most people wait too long to [take action]..."
- Content: Gentle urgency, explain cost of inaction
- CTA: "Schedule a free 15-min strategy call"
- Psychology: Loss aversion + low-friction offer

Day 14: Limited Offer with Deadline
- Subject: "[Specific offer] ends [date]"
- Content: Time-bound offer, clear value, easy next step
- CTA: "Claim your [offer] before [deadline]"
- Psychology: Urgency + scarcity

Day 21: Re-engagement Trigger
- Subject: "Still interested in [goal]?"
- Content: Check-in, ask what's holding them back
- CTA: Reply to this email or schedule call
- Psychology: Personal touch, opens dialogue
```

**Expected Performance:**
- Open Rate: 35-50% (first email), 20-30% (subsequent)
- Click Rate: 8-15% (CTA emails)
- Conversion: 8-12% (cold → meeting/purchase)
- Unsubscribe: <2% (if value-first approach maintained)

## Template 2: Product Launch Follow-Up

**Best For:** Leads who engaged with product launch (webinar attendee, waitlist subscriber). Goal: Convert warm interest to purchase.

**Structure:**
```
Hour 1: Thank You + Instant Access
- Subject: "You're in! Here's your [launch bonus]"
- Content: Fulfill launch promise immediately, set launch timeline
- Timing: Within 1 hour of signup
- Psychology: Instant gratification

Day 1: Behind-the-Scenes Story
- Subject: "Why I created [product]..."
- Content: Founder story, mission, personal connection to problem
- Psychology: Emotional connection + relatability

Day 2: Deep Dive into Problem
- Subject: "The REAL reason [problem] happens..."
- Content: Detailed problem breakdown, show expertise
- Psychology: Problem amplification → solution desire

Day 3: Solution Reveal + Early Access
- Subject: "[Product name] is officially here (early access)"
- Content: Product reveal, early bird pricing, bonuses
- CTA: "Get [X]% off - early access ends [date]"
- Psychology: Exclusivity + time urgency

Day 5: Success Stories + Proof
- Subject: "Already seeing results: [Customer testimonial]"
- Content: Real results from early adopters, screenshots, data
- Psychology: Social proof + FOMO

Day 7: Last Chance + Scarcity
- Subject: "Final hours: Early access ends tonight"
- Content: Countdown, stack the value, remove risk (guarantee)
- CTA: "Join [X] others who already purchased"
- Psychology: Urgency + bandwagon effect

Day 10: Post-Launch Value Offer
- Subject: "Missed early access? Here's a consolation..."
- Content: New offer (slightly different), still valuable
- CTA: "Get standard pricing + [bonus]"
- Psychology: Second chance, maintains momentum
```

**Expected Performance:**
- Conversion: 15-30% (warm launch leads)
- Revenue per subscriber: $50-$500 (varies by price point)
- Peak conversions: Day 3 and Day 7 (early access + deadline)

## Template 3: Webinar Nurture Sequence

**Best For:** Webinar attendees or registrants. Goal: Convert education into sales conversation.

**Structure:**
```
Pre-Webinar (24 hours before):
- Subject: "Tomorrow: Your [webinar topic] masterclass"
- Content: Build anticipation, pre-frame value, logistics
- CTA: "Add to calendar" + "Share with colleague"
- Psychology: Commitment increase

Pre-Webinar (1 hour before):
- Subject: "Starting soon! Join now..."
- Content: Quick reminder, login link, what to bring (notepad, questions)
- Delivery: Email + SMS
- Psychology: Urgency + accessibility

During Webinar:
- Subject: "We're LIVE! Join now..."
- Content: Click-to-join link, "Don't miss the bonus at the end"
- Timing: 5 minutes after start (for latecomers)
- Psychology: FOMO

Post-Webinar (1 hour after):
- Subject: "Thanks for attending! Here's your replay..."
- Content: Replay link, resources mentioned, exclusive offer
- CTA: "Claim your [webinar special offer]"
- Psychology: Immediate reinforcement

Post-Webinar (1 day after):
- Subject: "[Offer] ends in 48 hours..."
- Content: Recap key insights, special offer reminder, FAQs
- CTA: "Book your [strategy call / purchase]"
- Psychology: Time urgency

Post-Webinar (3 days after - Final):
- Subject: "Last chance: [Offer] expires tonight"
- Content: Final countdown, testimonials from other attendees who bought
- CTA: "Join [X] others who already took action"
- Psychology: Scarcity + social proof

No-Show Sequence (For registrants who didn't attend):
- Day 1: "Sorry we missed you! Here's the replay..."
- Day 3: "Did you watch? Here's the special offer..."
- Day 5: "Offer expires soon - don't miss out"
- Psychology: Second chance + urgency
```

**Expected Performance:**
- Attendee conversion: 10-25% (to offer)
- No-show conversion: 3-8% (from replay)
- Revenue per attendee: $200-$2,000 (varies by offer)

### Step 4: Niche-Specific Customization

After showing templates, apply niche-specific customizations based on KB insights:

**For SaaS/Software:**
- Timing: Faster (2-hour to 2-day delays, not 2-5 days)
- Content: Product demos, feature walkthroughs, integration guides
- CTAs: "Start free trial", "Book demo", "See it in action"
- Key angle: Efficiency, ROI, time savings

**For Real Estate:**
- Timing: Moderate (2-3 day delays, decision cycles are longer)
- Content: Market reports, property listings, neighborhood guides
- CTAs: "Schedule property viewing", "Get market analysis"
- Key angle: Market trends, investment value, family needs

**For Fitness/Coaching:**
- Timing: Moderate-Fast (1-3 day delays, momentum is key)
- Content: Transformation stories, workout tips, nutrition advice
- CTAs: "Book free consultation", "Join challenge"
- Key angle: Transformation, community, accountability

**For B2B Consulting:**
- Timing: Slower (3-7 day delays, longer decision cycles)
- Content: Case studies, ROI calculators, authority content
- CTAs: "Schedule audit", "Download resource"
- Key angle: Expertise, results, risk mitigation

**For E-commerce:**
- Timing: Fast (hours to 1-day delays, impulse purchases)
- Content: Product showcases, discount codes, reviews
- CTAs: "Shop now", "Claim discount"
- Key angle: Scarcity, social proof, trendiness

### Step 5: Generate Deployable Workflow JSON

### Step 6: Display Recommended Template

Present the best-fit template based on niche:

```
## Recommended Template: Cold-to-Warm Nurture for [Niche]

**Why this template?**
Based on [KB citation from ghl-best-practices], [niche] leads typically:
- Have a [short/medium/long] decision cycle ([X] days avg)
- Respond best to [content type] (e.g., case studies, demos, ROI data)
- Convert at [X]% with proper nurturing
- Need [X] touchpoints before buying decision

**Niche-Specific Adjustments:**
✓ Timing optimized for [niche] (e.g., 2-day delays instead of 5-day)
✓ Messaging angles focus on [key pain points for niche]
✓ CTAs tailored to [niche] buying process
✓ Content types proven to work in [niche]

**Performance Benchmarks (from KB):**
- Expected open rate: [X]% (industry avg: [Y]%)
- Expected click rate: [X]% (industry avg: [Y]%)
- Expected conversion: [X]% (industry avg: [Y]%)
- Average time to conversion: [X] days

[Display full workflow structure here]

**Customization Options:**
Would you like to adjust:
1. Timing (faster/slower sequence)
2. Content angles (more aggressive/softer sell)
3. Number of touchpoints (more/fewer emails)
4. Channel mix (add SMS, direct mail, etc.)
```

### Step 7: Offer MCP Deployment

```

Options:
1. Deploy now (I'll handle the technical setup)
2. Customize first (let's adjust timing, messaging, or structure)
3. Show me how to deploy manually
4. Save JSON for later

Enter choice (1-4):
```

**If choice 1 (Deploy now):**

```
Deploying "[Workflow Name]" to your GHL location...

Step 1: Checking authentication...
✓ OAuth connected to location: [Location Name]

Step 2: Validating workflow structure...

Next Steps:
1. Create [X] email templates in GHL:
   - nurture_day_1_intro
   - nurture_day_3_education
   - nurture_engaged_followup
   - nurture_hot_cta
   - nurture_reengagement

2. Test workflow with dummy contact
3. Activate workflow
4. Monitor analytics after 100 leads

Would you like me to help you write the email content for these templates?
```

### Step 8: Post-Deployment Success Guide

```
🎉 Your lead nurture workflow is deployed!

**What happens now:**

Automatic Triggers:
- Every new contact with tags "lead" + "[niche]_prospect" enters the sequence
- Day 1: Welcome email sent automatically
- Day 3: Education email sent
- [etc.]

**Monitoring & Optimization:**

Week 1-2: Baseline metrics
- Track open rates (expect 30-40% on first email)
- Track click rates (expect 8-15% on CTA emails)
- Look for drop-off points

Week 3-4: First optimizations
- A/B test subject lines on poorly performing emails
- Adjust timing if you see engagement drop-off
- Add or remove touchpoints based on behavior

Month 2+: Advanced optimization
- Segment by engagement (hot/warm/cold paths)
- Personalize content based on behavior
- Test different CTAs and offers

**Quick Wins:**
✓ Use {first_name} in every email (increases open rate by 5-10%)
✓ Mobile-optimize (60%+ opens are mobile)
✓ Send emails at optimal times (10am or 2pm local time)
✓ Keep subject lines under 50 characters
✓ Always have ONE clear CTA per email

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
❌ Emailing too frequently (causes unsubscribes)
❌ Being too salesy too early (break trust)
❌ Not personalizing content (feels spammy)
❌ Ignoring mobile optimization (majority of opens)
❌ No clear next step in each email (reader confusion)

- [Tutorial link 2]: Email copywriting for high conversions
- [Best practice doc]: [Niche]-specific messaging angles

```

## Error Handling

**If niche is unrecognized:**
```
I don't have specific nurture strategies for "[niche]" in the knowledge base.

Would you like me to:
1. Generate a generic lead nurture sequence (works for most industries)
2. Use strategies from a similar industry (e.g., "[suggested similar niche]")
3. Tell me more about your business so I can create custom recommendations

Which would you prefer?
```

**If KB returns no niche-specific results:**
```
I found general lead nurturing best practices but nothing specific to [niche].

I can still create a high-converting nurture sequence using proven principles:
- Problem awareness → Solution awareness → Decision
- Value-first approach (give before asking)
- Social proof and credibility building
- Urgency and scarcity at decision points

Would you like me to proceed with a general nurture sequence customized for your goals?
```

**Remember:** Always cite KB sources, customize for niche specifics, generate real deployable JSON, and offer MCP deployment with clear next steps.
